["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the structures related to the left ureter. From the provided documents, we can see that the ureter has a relation with the bladder (vesicoureteral hiatus) and also opens into the seminal colliculus in males or lower end of the urethra in females. We can also observe the anatomy and function of the ureterovesical junction. The morphology was studied in postmortem specimens of children with and without paraureteral diverticula and urethral obstruction, and function by deductive reasoning from radiographic and surgical observations in living children. This information helps us to understand the structures related to the left ureter.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
