["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"There is no direct information provided about embrasures in the given documents. However, we can analyze the documents to find relevant information. The first document discusses the position of the gingival margin and the continual passive eruption of teeth. This does not provide any information about embrasures. The second document discusses the remodeling of human gingival tissues following gingivectomy and provides measurements for preoperative and post-operative clinical pocket depths, but does not mention embrasures.
