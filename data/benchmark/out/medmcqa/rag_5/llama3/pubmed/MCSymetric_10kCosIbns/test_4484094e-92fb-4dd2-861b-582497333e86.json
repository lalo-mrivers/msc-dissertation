["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents suggest that wound infections are common postoperative complications. The study on microbiology of postoperative wound infection suggests that the type of operation and contamination can affect the rates of wound infection. In a situation where five patients develop post-operative wound infection on the same wound, it is likely that cross-infection could occur if proper infection control measures are not taken.\n\nConsidering the studies, I would think step-by-step as follows: What are the most common causes of wound infections? According to the study on microbiology of postoperative wound infection, Gram negative bacteria dominated in isolates from infected wounds after potentially contaminated operations. Similarly, according to the study on etiology and consequences of postoperative wound infection, classification of patients into 3 operative groups was found to be a significant factor.\n\nConsidering these findings, I would think that cross-infection is likely due to contamination during patient care or contact with contaminated surfaces or equipment. Therefore, the most effective method to prevent cross-infection in this scenario would be to focus on proper hand washing and hygiene practices.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
