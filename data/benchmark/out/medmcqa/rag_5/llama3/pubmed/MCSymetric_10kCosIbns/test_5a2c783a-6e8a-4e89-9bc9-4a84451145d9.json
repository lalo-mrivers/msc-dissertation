["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for criteria for admission in upper GI bleed. The relevant documents are related to endoscopy and diagnosis of upper gastrointestinal bleeding. There is no specific information provided about the criteria for admission in upper GI bleed. However, based on general medical knowledge, shock index >1.5, hematocrit >40%, and frank blood in nasogastric aspirate are all important indicators of severity in upper GI bleed. Blood pressure <100 mm Hg may not be a specific criterion for admission but rather an indication of hypotension which is often seen in severe bleeding. Therefore, it is unlikely that blood pressure <100 mm Hg would be considered a criterion for admission.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
