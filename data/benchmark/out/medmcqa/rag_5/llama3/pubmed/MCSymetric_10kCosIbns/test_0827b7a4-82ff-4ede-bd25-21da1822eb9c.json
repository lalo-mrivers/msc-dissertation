["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the contraction mechanism of skeletal muscles. The relevant documents provide information on the biochemical mechanisms of skeletal muscle adaptation to increased activity, the metabolic homoeostatic role of muscle and its function as a store of protein, ultrastructural changes in skeletal muscular fibres after physical loading, morphometric and cytochemical parameters of skeletal muscle during long-term physical exertion, and the contractility, biochemistry and morphology of an isolated preparation of human skeletal muscle. The documents suggest that calcium plays a crucial role in muscle contraction. Specifically, calcium binding to troponin initiates contraction. This is supported by the data on ultrastructural changes in skeletal muscular fibres after physical loading, which suggests that changes in submicroscopical structure occur in mitochondria, sarcoplasmic reticulum, T-system, contractile apparatus, etc., and by the information on the biochemical mechanisms of skeletal muscle adaptation to increased activity, which highlights the role of calcium in initiating contraction.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
