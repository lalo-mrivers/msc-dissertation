["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the treatment of choice for a young patient with an irreparable tear of the rotator cuff. The relevant documents discuss various aspects of surgical treatment of rotator cuff ruptures, including repair and reconstruction techniques. From these discussions, we can infer that when a tear is deemed irreparable, it may be best to focus on relieving symptoms rather than attempting to repair the torn tissue.\n\nThe document [Surgical treatment of rotator cuff rupture. Prognostic factors] suggests that when a subacromial osteoarthritis is present, arthroscopy should be considered as a minimally invasive procedure. This implies that when an irreparable tear is found in a young patient, it may be best to consider arthroscopic procedures or other minimally invasive techniques.\n\nIn the document [Rupture of the musculotendinous cuff of the shoulder], Codman's diagnostic criteria and treatment for musculotendinous cuff rupture are discussed. While this document does not specifically address irreparable tears, it suggests that surgical repair can result in good or excellent results in at least two-thirds of cases properly selected.\n\nIn light of these discussions, we can infer that a minimally invasive procedure such as arthroscopy or tendon transfer may be the most appropriate treatment for a young patient with an irreparable tear of the rotator cuff.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
