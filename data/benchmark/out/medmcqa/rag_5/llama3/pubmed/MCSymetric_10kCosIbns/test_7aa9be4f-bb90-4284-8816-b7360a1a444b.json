["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents suggest that calcium absorption from the gut is influenced by various factors. Phytates are known inhibitors of calcium absorption (A kinetic study of some factors which influence the intestinal absorption of calcium in rats). On the other hand, protein in diet seems to be a stimulator of calcium absorption (Modulation of intestinal absorption of calcium). Vitamin D is an established facilitator of calcium absorption. Alkaline pH in the gut also facilitates calcium absorption. Based on these findings, we can conclude that phytates are likely to decrease calcium absorption.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
