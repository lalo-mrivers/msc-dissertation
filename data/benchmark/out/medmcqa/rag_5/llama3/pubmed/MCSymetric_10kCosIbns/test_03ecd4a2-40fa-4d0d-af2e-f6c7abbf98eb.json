["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents provided are about medical devices and techniques. Upon reviewing the documents, I found that none of them directly relate to 'Serial technique' or 'Telescoping technique'. However, one of the documents discusses a 'telescopic suction tube for microsurgery', which could be related to telescoping. Another document mentions a 'telescopic system for distance consisting of contact lens and spectacle lens for low vision patients', which also relates to telescoping. Therefore, based on this information, I deduce that the correct answer is likely related to telescoping.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
