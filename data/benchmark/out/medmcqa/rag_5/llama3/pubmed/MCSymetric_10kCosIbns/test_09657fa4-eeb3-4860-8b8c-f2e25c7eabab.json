["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents discuss various aspects of the visual field and perimetry. The first document discusses the early defects in the visual field in glaucoma, including paracentral scotoma and nasal skip defects. There is no mention of the blind spot specifically. The second document discusses the influence of visual field testing procedure on blind spot size, which suggests that the size variations seem to be related to the target contrast provided by the instrumentation. This provides some information about the blind spot, but it does not directly answer the question about enlargement of the blind spot. The third and fourth documents discuss perimetry and blindsight, respectively, but do not provide specific information about the enlargement of the blind spot. Therefore, I must look for any mention of enlargement of the blind spot in the first document again.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
