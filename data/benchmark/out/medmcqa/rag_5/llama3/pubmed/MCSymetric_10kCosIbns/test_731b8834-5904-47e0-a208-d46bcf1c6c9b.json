["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the characteristics seen in 3rd nerve palsy. The diagnosis of congenital unilateral third-nerve palsies mentions that the pupils are dilated, which is a common feature. Accessory nerve palsy does not seem to be relevant to this question as it discusses a different type of nerve palsy. Oculomotor nerve palsies in children also do not provide any information about pupil dilation. Facial paralysis due to tumours does not mention anything about 3rd nerve palsy or pupil dilation either.\n\nTherefore, we are left with the clinical features of congenital unilateral third-nerve palsies which include pupil dilation, ptosis and aberrant regeneration. The question asks what is seen in all except, so it must be something that is not present in all cases. Considering this, the option that does not fit the description is C: Outward upward rolling of pupil as it is not a characteristic of 3rd nerve palsy.\n\nThis is because congenital unilateral third-nerve palsies do not mention anything about outward or upward rolling of pupils. In fact, the diagnosis emphasizes the benign nature and absence of associated neurological disease, which does not include any descriptions of unusual pupillary movements.\n\nTherefore, C: Outward upward rolling of pupil is the correct answer.\", \n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
