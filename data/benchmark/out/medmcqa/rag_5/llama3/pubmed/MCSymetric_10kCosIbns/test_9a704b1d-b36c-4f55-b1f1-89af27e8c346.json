["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 27-year-old pregnant lady with severe jaundice, altered sensorium, and intrauterine fetal death. The serum bilirubin levels are high (28.8 mg/dL), direct bilirubin being 18.6 mg/dL, which suggests that the jaundice is mainly due to unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia. AST and ALT levels are also elevated, suggesting liver damage. The patient has reactive Anti-HBc IgG, indicating past exposure to hepatitis B virus, but non-reactive for HBsAg, HCV, HEV, and HAV. This suggests that the current jaundice is not due to acute viral hepatitis A or C, nor chronic hepatitis C or E. Considering the patient's pregnancy status and severe liver damage, fulminant hepatitis due to hepatitis B infection seems a plausible explanation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
