["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents discuss enamel crystal chemistry, ultrastructural studies of enamel crystallites, scanning electron microscopic study of surface layer changes in artificial carious enamel, and crystal growth on enamel in relation to acid etching. The key information is that enamel calcification starts with the formation of enamel crystallites which are described as having a size, shape, and intercrystalline binding giving mechanical strength, cutting ability, and flexibility where necessary. This information suggests that calcification in enamel starts at the level of enamel matrix.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
