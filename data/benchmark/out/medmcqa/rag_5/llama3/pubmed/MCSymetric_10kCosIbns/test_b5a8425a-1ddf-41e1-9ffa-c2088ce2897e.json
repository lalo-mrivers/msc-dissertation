["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks which ligand is responsible for the uptake of LDL by receptors present in liver. We need to look at the relevant documents provided. The first document talks about the interaction between rabbit hepatocytes and 125I-labelled LDL. It mentions that after a 3 h incubation with 50 microgram LDL protein/ml, hepatocytes bound 400 ng (LDL protein)/mg (cell protein), internalized 280 ng/mg, and degraded 660 ng/mg. This suggests that the liver cells have receptors for LDL.\n\nThe second document discusses the regulation of LDL receptor, apoB, and apoE protein and mRNA in Hep G2 cells. It mentions that incubation of Hep G2 cells with LDL led to a complete downregulation of LDL receptor mRNA and LDL receptor protein synthesis. This suggests that LDL is the ligand for the LDL receptors present in liver.\n\nThe third document talks about receptor-mediated endocytosis, including the LDL receptor system. It mentions that LDL is taken up by receptor-mediated endocytosis and internalized into coated pits.\n\nThe fourth document discusses the regulation of LDL-receptor activity by low-density lipoprotein (LDL), cholesteryl-ester-rich beta-migrating very-low-density lipoprotein (beta-VLDL) and non-lipoprotein cholesterol. It mentions that LDL and beta-VLDL are bound to the same recognition site, tentatively the LDL receptor.\n\nBased on these documents, we can conclude that LDL is the ligand for receptors present in liver for uptake of LDL.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C: Apo E and Apo B-100\""]
