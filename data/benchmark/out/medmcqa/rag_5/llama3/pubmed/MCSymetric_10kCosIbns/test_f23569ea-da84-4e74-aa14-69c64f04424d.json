["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The cholera syndrome - pathogenesis and pathogens (author's transl) states that the same pathomechanism underlies both classical cholera and non-agglutinating vibrios. Non-cholera vibrios are organisms that are biochemically indistinguishable from Vibrio cholerae but do not agglutinate in vibrio 0 group 1 antiserum. Therefore, it is incorrect to say that V. cholerae is non-halophilic or grows on simple media. Additionally, the document 'Pathogenic mechanisms of a non-agglutinable Vibrio cholerae strain' shows that the strain had invasive and enterotoxigenic properties, which makes option C, 'Man is the only natural host', also incorrect. Finally, the documents do not mention anything about V. cholerae being unable to survive in extracellular environment.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
