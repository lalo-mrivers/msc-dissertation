["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking to differentiate between testicular failure and vas deferens obstruction. From the provided documents, we can see that when there is occlusion of the vas deferens, it affects the testis. This suggests that if azoospermia is found in a semen analysis despite a normal HSG, it's likely due to vas deferens obstruction rather than testicular failure. The documents also mention the possibility of epididymal stasis and fibrosis which can affect sperm motility and maturation. Therefore, we need to look for signs of epididymal changes in order to differentiate between the two conditions.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
