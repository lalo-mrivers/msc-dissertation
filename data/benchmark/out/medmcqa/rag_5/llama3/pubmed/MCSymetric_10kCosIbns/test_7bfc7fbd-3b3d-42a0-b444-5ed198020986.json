["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents discuss vertical root fractures, which are common complications during endodontic treatment. The study 'Vertical root fracture and relative deformation during obturation and post cementation' compares the amount of strain to the root that occurs during obturation and post cementation. It finds that placement of a post and loading causes significantly more relative deformation than obturation alone. This suggests that the root is more susceptible to fracture when a post is placed. The shape of the root that is most prone to vertical root fracture is therefore likely to be influenced by the presence of a post.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
