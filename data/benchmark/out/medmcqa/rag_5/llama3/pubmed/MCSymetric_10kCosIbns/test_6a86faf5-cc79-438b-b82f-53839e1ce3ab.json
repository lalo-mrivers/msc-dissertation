["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the role of barrier membrane in GTR (Gastric Tissue Repair). The provided documents discuss tight junctions, epithelial cell membranes, and intercellular contacts. Tight junctions are a rate-limiting barrier for passive transepithelial solute flow, which suggests that they play a crucial role in regulating the movement of substances across the epithelial layer. In the context of GTR, this would imply that the barrier membrane helps to control the movement of substances into and out of the underlying tissues.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
