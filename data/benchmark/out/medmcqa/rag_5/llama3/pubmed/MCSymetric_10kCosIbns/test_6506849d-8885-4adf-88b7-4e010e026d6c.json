["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for the denominator in perinatal mortality rate. Perinatal mortality rate is defined as the number of stillbirths and early neonatal deaths per 1,000 total births or deliveries. Therefore, we need to look at the definitions provided in the documents. The relevant document is 'Causes of perinatal mortality in the US Collaborative Perinatal Project.' According to this document, the underlying causes of 80% of perinatal deaths were identified in a study of 53,518 pregnancies in the United States. This suggests that total births or deliveries are the denominator. Another relevant document is 'Perinatal mortality in high risk pregnancy: a prospective study of preventable factors.' The authors mentioned that over a period of one year, there were 1,600 consecutive deliveries, and perinatal mortality was higher in mothers who had received inadequate antenatal care and/or with bad obstetric history. This further supports the idea that total births or deliveries are the denominator.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
