["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the mechanical transduction mechanism of Golgi tendon organs (GTOs) as a biological force transducer. The responses of isolated GTOs show that they detect force applied to muscle tendons, with threshold forces ranging from 8-170 dynes and discharge frequency proportional to applied static tension. Additionally, GTOs respond to dynamic stretch, but this is not the primary function. Therefore, Golgi tendon organ function is primarily detecting...\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
