["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents mention various causes of recurrent spontaneous abortion such as endocervical infections, cervical incompetence, uterine abnormality, hypothyroidism, and chromosomal abnormality. Since the patient is 26 years old, I would focus on excluding any underlying hormonal or structural abnormalities. The presence of recurrent abortions suggests a possible cervical factor, so I would investigate for cervical incompetence and endocervical infections. Additionally, since there are no mentions of lupus anticoagulant in the relevant documents, I would not perform a clot solubility test or test for anti-Russel viper venom antibodies. Therefore, my step-by-step thinking leads me to choose options that focus on excluding cervical factors and hormonal abnormalities.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
