["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The provided documents discuss flow cytometry and light scatter. In the first document, 'Utility of light scatter in the morphological analysis of sperm', it is mentioned that forward light scatter from a red (helium-neon) laser was used to detect the axial light loss and forward red scatter signals. This led to unique sigmoid distributions that reflected interspecies differences in shape and size, variations in particle refractive index and orientation within the flow cell. The text does not suggest an assessment of cell death, granules or fluorescence, but rather a method for differentiating morphologically diverse sperm nuclei.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
