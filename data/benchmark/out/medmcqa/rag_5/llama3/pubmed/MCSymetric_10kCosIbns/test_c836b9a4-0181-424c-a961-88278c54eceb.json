["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"There is no mention of cleaning base metal alloy in the provided documents. However, we can consider the properties of different solvents and acids mentioned in the documents. Ultratek crystal has a multiphasic structure; beryllium is concentrated in one phase. Under the influence of the solvent, this phase is attacked and the Be salts are released. Measurement of atom absorption revealed that the amount of beryllium actually released is extremely low. This suggests that certain solvents may be effective in cleaning base metal alloy. The addition of small amounts of alloying elements such as Zn, Mg, Si, Be, and Al on the high temperature oxidation resistance of noble metal alloys was examined. These alloying elements were chosen because their oxide have a high electrical resistivity and they have much higher affinity for oxygen than Cu.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
