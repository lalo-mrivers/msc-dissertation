["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the development of dental enamel. The first document discusses the changes taking place during enamel development, including the loss of organic matrix components prior to secondary mineralization. The second document describes late maturation of human dental enamel, which consists in a reduction of matrix components. The third and fourth documents discuss the structural and composition studies on the mineral component of dental enamel, including the increase in tissue density and crystalline perfection with maturation. Based on these descriptions, it is clear that the additional period required for enamel calcification after eruption into oral cavity is not explicitly stated. However, we can infer that this period may be related to the reduction of matrix components and the continued mineralization of the enamel.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
