["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the bit depth of RVG (Rivalrous-Texture Stereograms), which are complex stimuli that produce curious and unexpected depth effects. There is no mention of bit depth in the provided documents, as they are discussing various experiments and techniques related to stereoscopy and vision. Therefore, I will rely on my general knowledge of computer graphics and digital images. Bit depth refers to the number of bits used to represent the color or intensity information of an image. In this context, it's unlikely that RVG would be described in terms of bit depth, as it's a perceptual phenomenon rather than a digital representation. Therefore, I will choose the option that is most likely to be incorrect.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
