["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the provided documents, intraoperative histopathological analysis is described as a method for fast diagnosis. It can produce interpretable slides from cell-rich benign and malignant tumors, but it's not a complete substitute for usual fast-section techniques. Additionally, the suitability of stain-coated, ready-to-use slides (Testsimplets) for routine staining of intraoperative imprint-cytology preparations is discussed. This suggests that intraoperative histopathological analysis can provide a rapid diagnosis, but it may not always be definitive. Furthermore, the literature review highlights the advantages of intraoperative cytology, including high accuracy and reliability as a diagnostic method in the frozen section room. However, the documents do not explicitly state that this method provides an immediate definitive diagnosis of tumor.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
