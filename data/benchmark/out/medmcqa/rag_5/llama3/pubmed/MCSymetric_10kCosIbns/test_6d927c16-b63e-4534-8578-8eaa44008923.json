["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the inheritance pattern of true congenital anodontia. The relevant documents describe different types of tooth anomalies, including hypodontia (congenital absence of teeth), hyperdontia (supernumerary teeth), and oligodontia (partial tooth absence). Oligodontia is described as an autosomal dominant trait with incomplete penetrance and variable expressivity. There is no mention of X linked or polygenic inheritance patterns. Therefore, the correct answer must be related to autosomal dominance.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
