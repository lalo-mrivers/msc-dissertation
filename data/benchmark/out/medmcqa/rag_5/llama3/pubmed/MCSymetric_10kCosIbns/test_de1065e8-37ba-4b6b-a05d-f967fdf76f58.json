["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents discuss the cellular studies on antigen presentation by class II MHC molecules. Specifically, they mention the subcellular compartment where MHC class II molecules are located and the site where peptides are generated for MHC class II binding. This information suggests that MHC class II molecules are not synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum but instead associate with invariant chain, which takes them to the endosomal/lysosomal compartment.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
