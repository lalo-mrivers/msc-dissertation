["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To find the number of divisions to fill, we need to calculate how many milliliters are required to give 180 mg ceftriaxone. Since each milliliter contains 100 mg of ceftriaxone (500 mg/5ml), we can set up a proportion: 1 ml = 100 mg. We want to find the number of milliliters that corresponds to 180 mg, so we multiply both sides by 1.8 (since 180 is 1.8 times 100): 1.8 ml = 180 mg. Since the syringe has 10 divisions per milliliter, each division represents 0.1 ml. To find the number of divisions required to fill 1.8 ml, we multiply 1.8 by 10: 18.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
