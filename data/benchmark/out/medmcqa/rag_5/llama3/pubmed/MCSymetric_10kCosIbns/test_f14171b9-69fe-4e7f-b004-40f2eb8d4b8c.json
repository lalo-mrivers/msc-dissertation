["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"This question appears to be unrelated to the provided documents about molecular-pharmacological studies of drugs inhibiting Na+--K+-dependent ATPase separated from human gastric fundic mucosa, Action of some gastric antisecretory drugs on histamine H2-receptors, Mass ligand binding screening for receptor antagonists: prototype new drugs and blind alleys, Structure-basicity and structure-affinity relationships of beta-adrenergic blocking agents, and Studies on the mode of antagonism between adrenergic beta-mimetics and beta-blocking agents (IV). Therefore, I will analyze each option to find the one that is not a G2 phase blocker. Etoposide, Topotecan, and Paclitaxel are all known to be G2 phase blockers. Daunorubicin is an anthracycline antibiotic that can cause DNA damage and apoptosis. However, it does not specifically target the G2 phase of the cell cycle. Therefore, Daunorubicin is the correct answer.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
