["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the provided documents, we can analyze the root canal configuration of mandibular first premolars. According to Root canal morphology of mandibular premolars, it is stated that the mandibular first premolar had one canal at the apex in 74.0% of the teeth, two canals at the apex in 25.5%, and three canals at the apex in 0.5% of the teeth. This information suggests that the major pattern of accessory canals in mandibular first premolars is not a single furcation canal that extends from the pulp chamber to the intra-radicular region, as option A describes.\n\nAdditionally, Root canal configuration of the mandibular first premolar states that an interesting finding was the number of C-shaped canals which were associated predominantly with Type IV canal systems. This occurred in 14% of the roots. This suggests that the major pattern of accessory canals is not related to lateral or furcal canals, as options B and C describe.\n\nTherefore, based on the provided documents, the major pattern of accessory canals in mandibular first premolars is variable, which is option D.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
