["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about unconjugated bilirubin being increased in all, except. From the provided documents, it is known that unconjugated bilirubin is toxic and only unconjugated bilirubin can be considered as a direct measure of total bilirubin production. The 'direct' reaction without accelerator gives an estimate of conjugated and protein-bound (delta) species of bilirubin only if standardized reaction conditions are used. Based on this information, it can be inferred that unconjugated bilirubin is increased in all cases except those where there is a proper coupling to albumin.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
