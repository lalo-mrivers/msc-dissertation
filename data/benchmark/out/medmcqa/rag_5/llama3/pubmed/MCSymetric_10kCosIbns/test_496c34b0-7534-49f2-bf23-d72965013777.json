["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, it can be seen that blade-vent implants are purely tissue-borne constructions. In [Endosseous blade implantations in the edentulous patient and the prosthetic superstructure], it is mentioned that the retainers fixed to the denture base (Dolder jacket or Gilmore rider) are attached to the implant bar to guide the movement of the saddles. This suggests that there may be some mechanical interaction between the implant and bone, but no direct integration between the two. In [Bone changes incident to blade-vent implants], it is mentioned that the bone-metal interface consisted mainly of a thick layer of non-mineralized tissue of about 70 micrometer. This indicates that there may not be a strong integration between the implant and bone.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
