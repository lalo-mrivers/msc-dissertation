["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents discuss various anesthetic agents, their properties, and effects. We are looking for the agent that can cause pain on IV administration. Upon reviewing the texts, we find mentions of local anesthetics like EMLA, Xylocaine, and NUM, which are used topically or locally. There is no mention of these agents being administered intravenously (IV). The text '[Can choice of medications and adjuvants reduce risks of local anesthetic complications?]' discusses the use of adrenaline, felypressin, noradrenaline, but does not mention any IV administration-related pain. On the other hand, [Possibilities and limitations of intravenous anesthesia] discusses various substances for IV anesthesia, mentioning side effects and potential risks. One of these substances is Propofol, which is known to cause pain on IV administration. Therefore, we can infer that Propofol might be the agent causing pain on IV administration.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
