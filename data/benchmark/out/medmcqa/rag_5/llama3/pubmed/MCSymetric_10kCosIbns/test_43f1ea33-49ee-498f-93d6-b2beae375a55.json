["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question describes a 12-year-old boy with a sore throat of 4 days' duration. The examination reveals yellow-grayish patches on both tonsils and a foul smell from his mouth. Considering the symptoms, it is likely that the boy has bacterial pharyngotonsillitis. Among the options, acute rheumatic fever (A) and acute glomerulonephritis (B) are non-suppurative complications associated with streptococcal infections.
