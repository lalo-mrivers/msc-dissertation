["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about BSSO setback, which is a surgical procedure that involves the correction of mandibular deformities. The fixation in neutral posterior zone refers to the stabilization of the jaw in its natural position. Upon reviewing the provided documents, we can see that none of them explicitly discuss the treatment of mandibular deformities or fixation techniques used in BSSO setback. However, one document [Three-dimensional load displacement properties of posterior lumbar fixation] does discuss various fixation devices for spinal stabilization, including pedicular screws and plates. These devices are designed to provide stability to the spine, but their application is different from that of jaw correction. Therefore, we cannot find a direct answer in the provided documents. However, based on our general knowledge of surgical procedures, we can conclude that BSSO setback likely requires some form of fixation to stabilize the jaw in its natural position. This could include techniques such as miniplate fixation, which is commonly used in orthognathic surgery.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"]
