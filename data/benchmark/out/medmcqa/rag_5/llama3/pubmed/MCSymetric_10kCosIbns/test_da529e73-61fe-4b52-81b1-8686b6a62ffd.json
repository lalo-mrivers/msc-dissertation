["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has a history of cataract surgery 1 year back, which means they have undergone a total of 86 cataract extractions between 1973 and 1988 (according to the Corneal complications after cataract surgery in patients with rheumatoid arthritis). The patient is taking drugs for rheumatoid ahritis. They presented with sudden painless loss of vision, which suggests that this might be related to their medication or underlying condition. Considering the previous cataract surgery and the fact that they are taking medications for rheumatoid ahritis, I would consider the possibility of keratoconjunctivitis sicca developing due to the medications. This is supported by the study 'The ocular manifestations of juvenile rheumatoid arthritis' which mentions that 15 out of 70 patients had a preoperative history of keratoconjunctivitis sicca.\n\nGiven these findings, I would eliminate options B (Macular hole) and D (Chronic choroiditis), as they do not seem to be directly related to the patient's medication or underlying condition. Option C (Chloroquine toxicity) is also unlikely, given that it typically affects the macula and is characterized by a more gradual loss of vision.\n\nThe most likely diagnosis based on these findings would be option A: CME (Cytomegalovirus retinitis). This is supported by the fact that the patient presented with sudden painless loss of vision, which is consistent with the symptoms of CME. Additionally, CME is a common complication in patients taking immunosuppressive medications for rheumatoid ahritis, as mentioned in 'The ocular manifestations of juvenile rheumatoid arthritis'.\",\n\"answer_choice\": A"]
