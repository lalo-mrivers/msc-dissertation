["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The concept of 'first-pass' effect is related to the metabolism or decay of a drug prior to, during or shortly after its enteral absorption. This means that when a drug is administered orally, it may be metabolized in the liver before it even reaches the systemic circulation. Hepatic first-pass metabolism will occur for all routes of administration that involve oral intake, such as oral and sublingual administration. Intravenous administration bypasses the liver and avoids this first-pass effect. Similarly, intradermal administration does not involve oral intake and therefore also bypasses the liver.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A: Oral\""]
