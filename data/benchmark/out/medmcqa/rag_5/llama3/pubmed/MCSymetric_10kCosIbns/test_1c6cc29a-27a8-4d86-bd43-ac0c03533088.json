["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the type of cells that is more aggressive and has a higher recurrence potential in oral keratinizing cancer (OKC). Upon reviewing the relevant documents, I did not find any specific information about OKC. However, the documents provide general information about cancer, including its heterogenic nature, and the importance of early diagnosis and proper treatment in improving life-span and survival rate.\n\nThe document on 'Local recurrences following colorectal operations' mentions that 15-20% of patients operated for colorectal tumours develop local recurrences mainly in the first postoperative year. This may suggest that OKC also has a high recurrence potential, especially if not adequately radical operations are performed.\n\nHowever, I did not find any specific information about the aggressiveness and recurrence potential of different types of cells in OKC. Therefore, based on the provided documents, I cannot provide a definitive answer to this question.\n\nThe document 'Changes in the course of cancer' mentions that many neoplasms cannot be cured but life-span has been prolonged in many cases. This may suggest that some cancers are more aggressive and have higher recurrence potential than others.\n\nIn contrast, the document on 'Diagnosis and therapy of metastatic and recurrent colorectal tumors' suggests that a more active surgical therapy is advised for recurrent and metastatic tumours of the colon and rectum, which may indicate that these types of cancer are more aggressive and have higher recurrence potential.\n\nBased on this information, I would choose option D: None as the answer to this question, as the provided documents do not provide specific information about the aggressiveness and recurrence potential of different types of cells in OKC.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
