["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Since the question is about the function of 2% potassium sulphate in a gypsum product, I will look for relevant information from the provided documents. The most relevant document seems to be [Studies on the setting behavior of dental gypsum. 1. Experimental characterization of the hardening process], which discusses the setting of dental gyps (alpha- and beta-hemihydrate) under different conditions of processing. Since potassium sulphate is not mentioned in this study, I will consider other documents. The document [Experimental study on usage and dosage of gypsum] provides information on the preparation and properties of gypsum decoction, but does not mention potassium sulphate either. Therefore, I will focus on the document [Antimicrobial effects from incorporation of disinfectants into gypsum casts], which mentions a different type of product. However, there is no mention of potassium sulphate in this study as well. Finally, I will consider the document [Mould-reaction with gypsum bonded refractory investments], which discusses the properties of gypsum-bonded investment. Although it does not specifically mention potassium sulphate either, it provides information on the setting behavior of gypsum. Based on these findings, I conclude that potassium sulphate is likely to have an effect on the setting process or expansion of the gypsum product.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A: To regulate the setting expansion\"\n}"]
