["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about IV ultrashort acting barbiturate. We can see from the documents that mephobarbital (not mentioned but its analog meprobamate is) and thiopental are among the compounds studied for their depressant activity on the motor end-plate, which suggests a short duration of action. Pentobarbitone is also mentioned as one of the barbiturates studied for their anesthetic potencies on tadpoles. Phenobarbitone is not mentioned in this context. Therefore, we can infer that the ultrashort acting barbiturate is likely to be either mephobarbital or thiopentone.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
