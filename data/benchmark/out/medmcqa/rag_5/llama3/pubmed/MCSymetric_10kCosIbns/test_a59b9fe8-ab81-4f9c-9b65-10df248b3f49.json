["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the function of toluidine blue. From the provided documents, it can be seen that toluidine blue has been used to stain DNA-containing structures and produce metachromasia. It also has optical properties such as double refraction and dichroism. The documents suggest that toluidine blue binds stoichiometrically with DNA and produces a metachromatic and anisotropic staining of cell nuclei. This information can be used to infer the function of toluidine blue.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
