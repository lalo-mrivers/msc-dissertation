["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"There are no documents discussing the working time of zinc polycarboxylate cement. The first document discusses the elution of ions from a zinc polycarboxylate cement, but does not mention working time. The second document discusses the use of film thickness to measure working time of zinc phosphate cements, which is different than polycarboxylate cements. The third and fourth documents discuss manipulative variables on the properties of a polycarboxylate cement and linear dimensional changes during setting of a zinc phosphate cement, respectively. Therefore, based on the provided information, there is no relevant data to determine the working time of zinc polycarboxylate cement.\",\n\"answer_choice\": null\n}"]
