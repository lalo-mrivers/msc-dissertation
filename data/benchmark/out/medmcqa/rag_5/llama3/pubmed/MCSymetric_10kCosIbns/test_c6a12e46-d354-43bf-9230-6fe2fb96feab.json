["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the rapid onset of action seen by local anesthesia in small nerve endings. According to the provided documents, local anesthetics block nerve conduction by preventing the increase in membrane permeability to sodium ions that normally leads to a nerve impulse. Anesthetic molecules interact with the sodium channels directly, from the inner side of the nerve membrane. They bind within sodium channels which have opened during membrane depolarization, preventing the normal sodium ion flux.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"]
