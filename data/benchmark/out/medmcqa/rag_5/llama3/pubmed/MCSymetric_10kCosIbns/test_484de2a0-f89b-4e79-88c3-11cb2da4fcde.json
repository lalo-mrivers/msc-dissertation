["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The given average IOP is 30 mm with a standard deviation (SD) of 1.0. To find the lower limit of the average IOP that can be expected 95% of times, we need to calculate the confidence interval using the normal distribution curve. Since SD is small compared to the mean, we can assume normality. Using a z-table or calculator, we find that for a 95% confidence interval, the critical value is approximately -1.96. Then, we subtract this critical value from the mean IOP to get the lower limit of the average IOP.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
