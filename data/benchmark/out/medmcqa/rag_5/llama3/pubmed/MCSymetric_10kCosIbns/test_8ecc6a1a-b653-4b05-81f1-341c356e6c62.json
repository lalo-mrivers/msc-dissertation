["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the change that can be made to insulin structure with least change in function. From the provided documents, we know that some analogues of human insulin have been prepared by modifying a single amino acid or replacing half-cystines. We also know that most of these analogues only differ from human insulin in the replacement of a single amino acid in positions 2, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 11 of the A chain and 5, 7, 13 and 16 of the B-chain.\n\nUpon analyzing the documents, we can see that some analogues have similar biological effects as insulin but differ markedly in their potency. For example, [HisA8]insulin showed a relative potency of 2.46 in stimulating glucose oxidation, whereas [D-CysA6,A11]insulin had a potency of only 0.00027.\n\nFrom these findings, we can conclude that the function of insulin is relatively preserved even when significant changes are made to its structure. Therefore, the change that can be done in insulin structure with least change in function would likely involve modifications that do not significantly alter the overall three-dimensional structure of the protein.\n\nComparing the options provided, we can see that option C involves replacing amino acids at positions A5 and A6, which is a significant modification to the structure of insulin. Option A and B involve interchanging amino acids between different positions in the A or B chain, respectively. These changes are also likely to have a significant impact on the function of insulin.\n\nOption D involves breaking disulphide linkages, which may result in a change in the three-dimensional structure of insulin but does not necessarily alter its overall function. However, this option is less specific than the others and may not provide a consistent answer.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, it appears that options A, B, or C are likely to result in a significant change in the function of insulin, whereas option D may have a more subtle effect.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
