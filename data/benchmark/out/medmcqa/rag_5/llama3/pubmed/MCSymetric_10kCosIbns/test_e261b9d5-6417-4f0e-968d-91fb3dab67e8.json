["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the response to traumatic occlusal forces on alveolar bone. From the provided documents, we know that osteoclasts are involved in resorption of alveolar bone during remodeling associated with physiological tooth drift. We also know that osteopetrotic rats have reduced bone resorption and delayed healing after tooth extraction, indicating that osteoclastic resorption is a significant feature in normal healing processes. Therefore, it can be inferred that under traumatic occlusal forces, the alveolar bone would respond by increasing the number of osteoclasts.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
