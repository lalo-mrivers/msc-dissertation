["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents discuss the histomorphometric study of cementum and bone, which mentions that differences in cellularity and width of fibre bundles between lamellar bone and cementum have been reported. The study on Cementogenesis also discusses the substrate dependence in replacement cementum formation, but it does not directly mention the regeneration of cementum layers. Therefore, we need to look at other relevant documents, such as those discussing calcium phosphate cement (CPC). CPC is known to induce a thin fibrous connective tissue with a small number of lymphocytes and plasma cells, which suggests that the regeneration leads to the formation of cellular mixed cementum.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
