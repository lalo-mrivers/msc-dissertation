["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question describes a scenario where an 8-year-old child has avulsed their central incisor tooth due to trauma. The tooth has been contaminated with debris for 20 minutes. Based on the provided documents, it is clear that reattachment of the periodontal fibers occurs after 2 weeks of splinting (Management of an avulsed deciduous incisor). Additionally, a study showed that despite an extraoral period of more than 12 hours, a functional PDL survived when milk was used as a storage medium for exarticulated teeth (Milk as storage medium for exarticulated teeth: report of case). In the context of endodontics or root canal therapy (Endodontics or root canal therapy), it is important to consider the possibility of focal infection and its treatment.\n\nConsidering these points, it seems that immediate reimplantation without proper cleaning may not be the best option. Instead, the tooth should be cleaned to remove debris before being replanted. This approach is also supported by the document [Approach to pulpal and pulpo-periodontal lesions of the temporary teeth using therapeutic endodontics], which emphasizes the importance of cleaning and preserving the deciduous tooth in order to avoid extraction.\n\nBased on this analysis, option B: Clean and curette root surface and reimplant is the most appropriate treatment.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
