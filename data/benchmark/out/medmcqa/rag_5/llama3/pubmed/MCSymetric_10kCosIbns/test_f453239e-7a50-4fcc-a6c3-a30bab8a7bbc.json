["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks for the best biochemical description of glucose. The documents provided describe various methods for determining glucose levels in biological fluids, including enzymatic reactions with hexokinase and glucose dehydrogenase. From these descriptions, we can infer that glucose is a monosaccharide, as it reacts with enzymes such as hexokinase to produce 6-phosphoglucono-1,5-lactone.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
