["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Since we are dealing with a wide buccolingual space, the main concern is to achieve good retention and prevent the restoration from failing. Considering the principles discussed in [Restoration of hemi-arcades with amalgam], it's likely that the author would recommend using an amalgam onlay restoration as described in 'Amalgam onlay restoration'. This technique involves reducing the cusp to provide a sufficient bulk of amalgam, which would be necessary to fill the wide buccolingual space. The use of a single wedge technique is also supported by [Effect of grooves on resistance form of conservative Class 2 amalgams], which shows that grooves located occlusally to the axiopulpal line angle provide more resistance than conventional grooves or no grooves. Therefore, a Single Wedge (C) would be the most suitable choice.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
