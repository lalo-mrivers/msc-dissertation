["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the mechanisms of adhesion between various materials and enamel. Enamel mordant selection is assisted by ESCA (XPS), which indicates that certain cations are sorbed by enamel from an acid etching solution containing phosphoric acid and equimolar concentrations of candidate mordant salts. The tensile bond strengths of composites to enamel etched with various concentrations of phosphoric acid have been shown to correlate closely with the phase diagram for the system Ca(OH)2/H3PO4/H2O. This suggests that chemical bonds form between the composites and enamel.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
