["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents discuss the properties of various suture materials, including chromic gut and plain gut. Chromic gut is mentioned as a material that starts losing its strength later compared to polyglucolic acid fibers. There is no direct information about the advantages of chromic gut over plain gut in deep wounds. However, one document compares the reactions of connective tissue and fibers to silk, catgut, chromic catgut, and polyglucolic acid fibers buried in the subcutis. This study suggests that chromic catgut produces minimal inflammatory reactions compared to catgut. Based on this information, it can be inferred that chromic gut may have less tissue irritation compared to plain gut.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D\n}"]
