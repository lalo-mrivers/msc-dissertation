["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with instability of the knee joint at full extension but no instability at 90 degrees of flexion. This suggests that the damage is likely to be related to the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) as it is responsible for stabilizing the knee in the extended position. The fact that there is no instability at 90 degrees of flexion suggests that the posterior cruciate ligament and menisci are intact. Therefore, the most common structure damaged is likely to be a part of the ACL.\", \"answer_choice\": B}"]
