["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks for indications of thrombolysis in a patient with stroke. From the provided documents, we can identify the relevance of thrombolysis to brain attack, myocardial infarction, and stroke. In particular, the article 'Thrombolytic therapy for stroke' highlights the potential benefits of thrombolysis in acute ischemic stroke, especially if administered early. The document also emphasizes the importance of timely treatment within hours of symptom onset.\n\nUpon reviewing the options, we can eliminate option A as it is not related to the administration of thrombolysis. Option B does not necessarily contradict the use of thrombolysis, as blood pressure control is important in conjunction with therapy.\n\nOptions C and D seem more relevant. The CT scan finding of edema less than 1/3rd of middle cerebral aery territory may indicate a safer treatment scenario, but it does not directly contraindicate thrombolysis.\n\nOn the other hand, acute ischemic stroke within 3 hours of onset is an indication for thrombolysis, as emphasized in several documents.\n\nIn conclusion, option C 'On CT scan, edema less than 1/3rd of middle cerebral aery territory' is the only correct answer.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"]
