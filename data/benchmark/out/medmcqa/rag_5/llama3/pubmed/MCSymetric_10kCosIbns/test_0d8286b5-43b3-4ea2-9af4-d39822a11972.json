["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about how dry heat destroys microorganisms. The provided documents are about psychrophilic organisms' resistance to dry heat, the effect of cooling and warming rates on bacterial survival, operative evaluation of heat exchange components in humans, influence of climatic conditions on human body's heat balance, and changes in carbohydrate digestion enzymes and liver glycogen during heat adaptation. None of these topics directly address the destruction mechanism of microorganisms by dry heat. However, we can look at the values mentioned in the first document: D(110 degrees C) values ranged from 7.5 to 122 min, whereas the D(123 degrees C) values ranged from less than 1.0 to 9.8 min. This implies that microorganisms are killed or inactivated by dry heat. Considering this, we can look at our options: A is not relevant to the context; B is also irrelevant as oxidation doesn't necessarily kill microorganisms; C and D are both related to cellular processes but don't directly address how microorganisms are destroyed by dry heat.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
