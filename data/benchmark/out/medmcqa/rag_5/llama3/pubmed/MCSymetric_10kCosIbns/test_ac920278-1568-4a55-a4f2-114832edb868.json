["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents provided don't explicitly state the most difficult maxillary tooth to anaesthetize by infiltration. However, we can analyze the information related to anesthesia provided in each document. The first document discusses the effectiveness of infiltration anesthesia in the mandibular primary molar region. It doesn't provide any information about maxillary teeth. The second and third documents are case reports that don't address the specific question.

Therefore, we need to rely on general knowledge or other external sources to answer this question.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
