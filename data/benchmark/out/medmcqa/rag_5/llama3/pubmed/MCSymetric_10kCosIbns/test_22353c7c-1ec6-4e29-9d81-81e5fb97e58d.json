["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant document 'Heterogeneity of motor units activating single Golgi tendon organs in cat leg muscles' states that the proportion of tendon organ-activating motor units found in the studied samples suggests that altogether, the Golgi tendon organs of a muscle monitor the contraction of every motor unit in this muscle. This implies that each Golgi tendon organ is connected with multiple motor units. The document does not provide a specific number of muscle fibers attached to one Golgi tendon organ.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: 15-75\""]
