["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about measuring the arch perimeter. From the given documents, we can see that there are discussions on computerized perimeters (Competer) and electronic systems for measuring area and perimeter directly on cross-sectional ultrasonic images. However, none of these discussions explicitly mention measuring the arch perimeter. The closest reference to the measurement of length is found in the document 'Underestimation of length by subjects in motion', which discusses errors in estimating lengths. Since the question specifically asks about measuring the arch perimeter, we cannot find a direct answer in the provided documents. Therefore, we need to look at the options and see if any of them are relevant.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"None of the above\"\n}"]
