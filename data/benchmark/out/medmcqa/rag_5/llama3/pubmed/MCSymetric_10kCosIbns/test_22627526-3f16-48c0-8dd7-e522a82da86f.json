["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about hormones that are under inhibitory control of the hypothalamus. We can look at the relevant documents to find the answer. The first document talks about the peptide hormones and the neurosecretion mechanism, but it doesn't mention specific hormones being under inhibitory control. The second document mentions hypothalamic hormones acting directly on the adenohypophysis to increase or decrease the release of pituitary tropic hormones, but again doesn't specify which hormones are under inhibitory control.\n\nThe third document talks about the effect of hypothalamic differentiation on the functional state of the hypophyseal-adrenal system. It mentions that the hypothalamus can maintain ACTH-glucocorticoid secretion at a normal level, but increases sensitivity to noradrenaline and serotonin. This suggests that the hypothalamus may be inhibiting or regulating some hormones.\n\nThe fourth document talks about hypothalamic cardiovascular regulation and doesn't mention anything specific about hormone control.\n\nThe article summary mentions neuroendocrinology results for hypothalamus and hypophysis, but doesn't provide any specific information about hormone inhibition.\n\nBased on this analysis, we can infer that the answer is related to hormones that are regulated by the hypothalamus. From the available documents, GH is mentioned as being affected by the hypothalamic differentiation in the third document, which suggests that it may be under inhibitory control of the hypothalamus. Prolactin is also mentioned in the same document, but there is no clear indication that it is under inhibitory control.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that both GH and prolactin are likely to be under inhibitory control of the hypothalamus.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
