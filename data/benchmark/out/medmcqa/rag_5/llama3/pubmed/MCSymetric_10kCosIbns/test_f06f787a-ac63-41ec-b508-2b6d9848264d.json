["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks for a negative acute phase reactant. Acute phase reactants are proteins that increase in concentration during an acute inflammatory response. Among the options, C-reactive protein (CRP) is known to be a positive acute phase reactant, increasing in response to inflammation and infection. Haptoglobin is also a positive acute phase reactant, binding to free hemoglobin and increasing in response to hemolysis or tissue damage. Ferritin is an iron storage protein that increases in response to inflammation and tissue damage, making it a negative acute phase reactant. Albumin, being a major plasma protein, remains relatively constant during acute inflammatory responses and can be considered as a negative acute phase reactant.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C: Albumin\""]
