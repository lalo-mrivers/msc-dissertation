["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the structure that holds bones together. The relevant documents mention the formation of bones from cartilage, the role of muscle and nerve systems during growth, and the ultrastructural interrelationships of collagen fibrillar components in human connective tissue. It also discusses the multicomposite structure of tendon and the role of carbohydrate-protein complexes in the organization of the microstructure of fibrous connective tissue. None of these sections explicitly mention a long cord or sheet of dense fibrous connective tissue, but we can infer that it might be related to the formation of joints and the connection between bones. This leads us to the section about chick vincula: elastic structures with a check-rein mechanism, which describes the attachment of blood vessels to digital flexor tendons within their synovial sheaths.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
