["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the provided documents, we can see that non-immune hydrops is characterized by fluid accumulation in various body cavities. In 'Non-immune hydrops. The importance of urgent investigation if the prognosis is to be improved', it is mentioned that each case had a different aetiology requiring specific treatment. We also see from 'Bilateral subdural effusion (hygromas) in non-immune hydrops fetalis' that fluid accumulation in serous cavities, including subdural effusions, is a component of non-immune hydrops.\n\nFrom 'Clinico-pathological findings in non-immune hydrops fetalis', we see that cardiac conditions formed the largest subgroup (36%) and seven cases remained idiopathic. This suggests that cardiomegaly may be present in some cases.\n\nIn 'Fetal hydrops' and '[Fetal hydrops (review of 30 cases)]', we see that skin oedema, ascites, and large placenta are all mentioned as features of non-immune hydrops.\n\nTherefore, considering these points, cardiomegaly is not seen in every case of non-immune hydrops.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
