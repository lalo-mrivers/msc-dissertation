["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The child presents with high grade fever, inspiratory stridor and develops swallowing difficulty with drooling of saliva since last 4-6 hours. This suggests an acute respiratory emergency possibly due to epiglottitis or another airway obstruction. The most common causes of these emergencies are fulminant (infectious) diseases of the upper and lower airways, a particularly significant aspect being the considerable mucosal swelling as compared with adults. Aspiration of foreign bodies is a further cause of acute, life-threatening respiratory distress. The relevant document 'Obstruction of the major pediatric airway' suggests that the first step would be to take a brief history, determine the anatomic level of obstruction and estimate the degree of obstruction with the maximal potential hazard. In this case, given the inspiratory stridor and swallowing difficulty, it is likely that the obstruction is at the level of the epiglottis.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
