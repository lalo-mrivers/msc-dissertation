["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the arterial supply of the submandibular gland. The relevant documents mention the autonomic nervous system's influence on the secretion products of the dog submandibular gland, but they don't provide information about the blood supply of the gland. There are no documents that explicitly mention the branches of the external carotid artery (ECA) and their relation to the submandibular gland.\n\nThe 'Effects of autonomic nerve stimulation on the secretory products of the dog submandibular gland' document only discusses the parasympathetic division's influence on acinar cell products, the sympathetic division's influence on duct cell secretory proteins, and demilune cell secretory products being influenced by both divisions. There is no mention of blood supply.\n\nThe 'CT appearances of normal and obstructed submandibular duct' document only discusses CT scans and does not provide information about blood supply.\n\nThe 'Supporting effects of myoepithelial cells in submandibular glands of dogs when acting against increased intraluminal pressure' document is also unrelated to the question, discussing the role of myoepithelial cells in supporting the secretory function of the gland under high pressure conditions.\n\nThe 'The ultrastructure of the rabbit submandibular gland' and '[Influence of calcium and potassium ions on the parasympathetic stimulation secretory response of the isolated and perfused submandibular gland (author's transl)]' documents are also unrelated to the question, discussing cell morphology and ion concentration effects on salivary secretion.\n\nTherefore, it is necessary to look up general knowledge about the blood supply of the submandibular gland. According to general knowledge, the submandibular gland receives its arterial supply from the facial artery, which is a branch of the external carotid artery (ECA). Hence, the answer should be D: Facial.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
