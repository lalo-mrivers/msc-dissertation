["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Firstly, I will look at the patient's age (5 years old) and symptoms (left ventricular hypertrophy and central cyanosis). Then, I will review the provided documents to identify potential conditions that match these findings. From the document [Echocardiographic study of hypertrophic myocardiopathy in children], I see that hypertrophic cardiomyopathy can present with left ventricular hypertrophy. However, this condition does not typically cause central cyanosis. Next, I will consider other possibilities. The document [Double outlet left ventricle with intact ventricular septum] describes a condition that can present with cyanosis since birth. Although the patient is 5 years old now, this condition could still be a possibility. Finally, I will review the potential choices: Tricuspid atresia (A), Eisenmenger syndrome (B), Tetrology of Fallot (C), and Total anomalous pulmonary venous drainage (D). Based on my analysis, I believe that Tetrology of Fallot (C) is the most probable diagnosis.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
