["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the membrane surface potential and the reactivity of the system II primary electron acceptor to charged electron carriers in the medium. The key point is that the local concentration of electron acceptors at the thylakoid surface changes due to the electrical potential difference between the surface and the bulk aqueous phase (Gouy-Chapman diffuse double layer theory). This means that the value of Z depends on the membrane surface potential, which in this case is -30. According to the Gouy-Chapman diffuse double layer theory, a negative surface potential would result in an increase in the local concentration of electron acceptors at the thylakoid surface.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
