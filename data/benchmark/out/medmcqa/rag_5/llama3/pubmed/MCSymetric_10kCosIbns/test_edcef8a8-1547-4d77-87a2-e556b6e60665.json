["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the cause of medial squint. The provided documents describe concomitant squint as a result of congenital dissymmetry in the structure of the eyes or oculomotor apparatus and insufficiency of optomotor reflexes. They also mention that changes of muscle tissue are found in convergent squint, especially in insufficiency of convergence. Additionally, the documents describe paralytic dyssynergies, which could be related to medial squint. Based on these descriptions, it seems that a nerve paralysis is likely involved. The specific nerves responsible for eye movements are the oculomotor nerve (III), abducens nerve (VI), trochlear nerve (IV), and optic nerve (II). The documents do not mention any histological changes in the optic nerve or its involvement in medial squint.\", \"answer_choice\": B}"]
