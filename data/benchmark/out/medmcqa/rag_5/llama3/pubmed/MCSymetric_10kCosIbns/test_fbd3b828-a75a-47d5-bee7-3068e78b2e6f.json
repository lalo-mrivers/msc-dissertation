["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The passage does not explicitly mention the preferred sites for insulin injection. However, it discusses subcutaneous insulin infusion and continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII). In CSII, the infusion site is mentioned as being in the lower para-umbilical region. This suggests that the umbilicus area might be less commonly preferred for insulin injection. Additionally, there is no mention of insulin absorption rates or peak times for sites like anterior thigh, lateral thigh, and dorsum of arm.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
