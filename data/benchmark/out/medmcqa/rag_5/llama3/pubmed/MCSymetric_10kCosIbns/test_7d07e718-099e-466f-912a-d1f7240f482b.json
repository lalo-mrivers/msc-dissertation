["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about venous drainage of the esophagus. We need to analyze the relevant documents to find information about venous drainage of the esophagus. Document [Scanning electron microscopy of esophageal microvasculature in human infants and rabbits] describes the venous plexus of the esophagus, including a submucosal venous plexus and perforating veins that connect this plexus with circumferential veins. It also mentions that valves are not present in any of the veins. Document [Venous drainage of the heart with special references to the excito-conduction system] discusses the venous drainage of the heart, including coronary veins. However, it does not specifically mention the esophagus. The other documents do not provide relevant information about venous drainage of the esophagus.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
