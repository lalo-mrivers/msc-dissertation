["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the triangle formed by projection of the orifices of the canals of maxillary molars. We know that the roots of the first and second molars curve towards the buccal on 54.6% and 52.3% of them, respectively. This information does not directly help us with this question. The internal anatomy study mentions that the incidence of two root canals in the mesiobuccal root is higher in second maxillary molars than in first maxillary molars. However, this information also does not directly relate to the triangle formed by projection of the orifices of the canals. We need to focus on the morphologic study of the maxillary molars and their roots. The study mentions that complete separation of all three roots was observed on 86.4% of the first molars, 75.9% of the second molars and on only 18.8% of the third molars. This information helps us understand the root anatomy, but it still does not directly relate to the triangle formed by projection of the orifices of the canals. The internal anatomy study also mentions that 25% of the first molars, 42% of the second molars and 32% of the third molars presented four (4) root canals. However, this information does not directly relate to the triangle formed by projection of the orifices of the canals.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
