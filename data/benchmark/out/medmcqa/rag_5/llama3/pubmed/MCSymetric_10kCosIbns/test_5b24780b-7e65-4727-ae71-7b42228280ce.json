["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for 'odd drugs' which are used in anaesthetic emergencies. The relevant documents discuss specific drug interactions in anaesthesia, anesthesiological problems in cardiopathic patients, and possibilities and limitations of intravenous anesthesia. None of the given options (AminophylLine, Epinephrine, Atropine sulphate, Amoxycillin) are mentioned as anaesthetic drugs in these documents.
