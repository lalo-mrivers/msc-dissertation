["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"There is no direct information about the shape of access cavity in mandibular 1st molar with 4 canals. However, we can look at the root canal configuration of the mandibular first premolar which has a similar anatomy to the mandibular 1st molar. The study states that 24% of the premolars contained Type IV canals and an interesting finding was the number of C-shaped canals which were associated predominantly with Type IV canal systems. This occurred in 14% of the roots. Since we are looking at a mandibular 1st molar with 4 canals, it is likely that it has a Type IV canal system. Therefore, we can infer that the access cavity shape might be C-shaped.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
