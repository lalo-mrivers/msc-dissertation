["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The provided documents discuss the issue of bone necrosis during implant preparation. The 'Heat distribution in bone during preparation of implant sites' document highlights that generation of heat spread in each drill and bur differed according to bur shape and drilling site, with maximum heat temperature without irrigation being higher than that with irrigation for any IMZ, ITI, and Br√•nemark drill. This suggests that the temperature at which bone necrosis occurs is likely to be high. The 'Atraumatic surgical technique and implant bed preparation' document does not provide specific information on temperatures. The other documents do not discuss bone necrosis.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
