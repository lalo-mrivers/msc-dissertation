["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking which statement about cystic fibrosis (CF) is not true. From the provided documents, we know that CF is an autosomal recessive disorder (DNA analysis and gene diagnosis of cystic fibrosis). Additionally, the most common defect defined in the CF gene is a three-base deletion resulting in the loss of phenylalanine residue (delta F508) in the tenth exon of the CFTR gene. This indicates that the abnormality is not related to calcium transport but rather a mutation in the CFTR gene. Therefore, statement B is not true.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
