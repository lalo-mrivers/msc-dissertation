["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents discuss the oral ecology and its pathogenic relation with the origin of primary periodontitis associated with plaque. Microbial factors involved in the genesis of periodontitis are related with supragingival (coronal) and subgingival plaque. From these documents, it can be inferred that Gram-positive organisms such as Rothia dentocariosa, Actinomyces naeslundii and Actinomyces viscosus are associated with minimal disease in the patients. This suggests that Actinomyces may play a relatively minor role in periodontitis.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A: Actinomyces\"\n}"]
