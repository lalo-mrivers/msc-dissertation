["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the Chi-square test being used to measure the degree of something. The documents provided give information on different types of Chi-square tests, including McNemar's test for paired data and Fisher's Exact Test for 2 x 2 tables with small sample sizes. None of these texts suggest that Chi-square is used to measure causal relationships between exposure and effect, or correlation between two variables. However, one document mentions the association between two variables in the context of contingency tables with repeated measurements. Therefore, it can be inferred that Chi-square test is used to measure the degree of association between two variables.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
