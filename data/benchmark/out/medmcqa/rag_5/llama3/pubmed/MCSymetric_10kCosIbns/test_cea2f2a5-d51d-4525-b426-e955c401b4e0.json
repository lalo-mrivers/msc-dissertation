["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"We need to look for information on accessory canals in mandibular molars. The relevant document is 'Prevalence, location, and patency of accessory canals in the furcation region of permanent molars'. According to this study, accessory canals were demonstrated in the 'furcation region' in 29.4% of mandibular molars. We are looking for a single accessory canal arising from the coronal 1/3rd, which is not mentioned as a specific location in this study. However, we can infer that such a canal would be classified under 'accessory canals' and therefore included in the overall percentage of 29.4%. Since there is no further information on the exact location or proportion of accessory canals arising from the coronal 1/3rd specifically, we will compare this to the available options.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: None of the above\""]
