["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, I can see that none of the given options specifically mention a helminth or its life cycle. Therefore, I will focus on general characteristics and patterns described in the papers. From 'On the postcycle parasitism in helminths...' it is mentioned that postcycle parasitism has been observed in various trematodes, cestodes and nematodes parasitizing the digestive tract of vertebrates. This suggests that the helminth might be a nematode or a trematode. The rest of the documents do not provide any specific information about this particular helminth's life cycle or transmission. Therefore, I will focus on general patterns described in 'Certain principles of the secondary simplification of the life cycles of helminths...' which state that at the secondary simplification of the life cycles of helminths never fall out the first intermediate host in Trematoda and the definitive host in Nematoda. This suggests that this helminth might be a nematode or a trematode with a complex life cycle.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
