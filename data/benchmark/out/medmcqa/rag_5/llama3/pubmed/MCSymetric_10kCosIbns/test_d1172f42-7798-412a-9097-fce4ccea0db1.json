["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to the relevant documents, oral cancer is a rare disease that can spread to different parts of the body. Metastatic tumors of the oral cavity are uncommon, and mandibular localization is the most frequent (Metastatic localization in the buccal cavity). The case report suggests that oral cancer can also metastasize to other areas such as the gingivo-maxillary region, femur, and cutaneous tissues. Additionally, Advances in the diagnosis and treatment of oral cancer note that cancer of the oral cavity is rare but rates are rising, especially in lower socioeconomic groups and metropolitan areas. Recognizing oral lesions emphasizes the importance of early detection of oral cancer. Carcinoma of the oral cavity: on the prognostic significance of the primary tumour site suggests that given an identical extension and analogous metastasizing rate, there is no computationally demonstrable difference in prognosis between primary tumours sited at different levels and areas of the oral cavity.\n\nBased on these documents, it appears that the most common route for metastasis of oral cancer is through blood vessels.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
