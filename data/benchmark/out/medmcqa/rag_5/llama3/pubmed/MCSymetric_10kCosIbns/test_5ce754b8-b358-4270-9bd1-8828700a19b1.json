["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the appropriate blade angle for scaling and root planing. The documents provided mention different radii of curvature for various instruments, but none of them specifically discuss blade angles for scaling and root planing. However, we can consider the document 'Preparing guide planes for removable partial dentures' which mentions an occlusal divergence of 3 to 4 degrees from absolute parallelism. This might imply that a slight angle deviation is acceptable for certain procedures, but not necessarily for root planing. Therefore, we should look for documents related to scaling and root planing or periodontics.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
