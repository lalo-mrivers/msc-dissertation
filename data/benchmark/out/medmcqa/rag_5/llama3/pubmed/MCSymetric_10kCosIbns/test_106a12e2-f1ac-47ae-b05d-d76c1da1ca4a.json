["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the characteristics of hyaline membrane disease (HMD) of lungs. From the provided documents, we can identify three types of bubbles that can be radiographically identified in HMD: overdistended terminal bronchioles and alveolar ducts (Type I), pulmonary interstitial emphysema related to positive pressure assisted ventilation (Type II), and focally distended alveolar groups in a scarred, immature lung (Type III). This information does not directly relate to the question about FRC (functional residual capacity) and closing volume. However, we can infer that HMD is characterized by abnormal gas exchange and ventilation, which may affect FRC.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: FRC is independent of closing volume\""]
