["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's initial treatment included vagal maneuvers and adenosine administration. Since the rhythm remains refractory to maximum dose of adenosine, we should consider the possibility of ventricular tachycardia or another underlying arrhythmia. Wide QRS complex tachycardia of ventricular origin is usually not affected by adenosine. Additionally, the patient's blood pressure is low, indicating hemodynamic instability. Therefore, it is likely that the rhythm is ventricular in origin.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
