["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents highlight the aggressive nature of retinoblastoma, with most patients (18 out of 22) dying from recurrence or metastases of the primary tumor. The location of the primary tumor is mostly in the head, which suggests that optic nerve invasion could be a possible mode of spread. Additionally, the document [Fatal outcome of retinoblastoma] mentions that two clinical groups can be distinguished based on the site of recurrence. In patients with recurrence from the side of the enucleated eye, the mean survival time was 26 months, whereas the four children with relapse originating in the conservatively treated eye survived 23 to 65 months. This suggests that retinoblastoma can recur or metastasize from the primary tumor site, which supports optic nerve invasion as a mode of spread.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
