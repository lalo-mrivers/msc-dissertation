["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about a patient admitted to hospital for community acquired pneumonia. The combination therapy of beta lactams and azithromycin is given. Azithromycin has activity against gram positive organisms such as staphylococci, streptococci, Moraxella catarrhalis and other rapidly growing pyogenic bacteria. It also has good activity against Haemophilus influenzae (MIC90 0.5 mg/l).
