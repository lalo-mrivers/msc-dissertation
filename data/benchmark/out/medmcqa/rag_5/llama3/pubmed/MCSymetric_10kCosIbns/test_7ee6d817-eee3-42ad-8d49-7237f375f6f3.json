["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents suggest that HCV infection is associated with chronic active hepatitis. The VA Cooperative Study Group (No. 119) found that antibodies to hepatitis C virus were positive in 27.1%, 4.8% and 3.0% of patients with alcoholic liver disease, hospitalized patients without liver disease, and nonalcoholic patients without liver disease, respectively. This suggests that HCV is a biomarker for chronic active hepatitis.
