["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the angle associated with fracture of... We are given a choice between Calcaneum, Talus, Navicular, and Cuboid. To answer this question, we need to look for information in the provided documents that relates to the angles of fractures in bones. One document mentions experiments on adaver tibial fractures placed in long leg plaster casts, which showed possible deformity ranging from 4-8 degrees. This suggests that fracture movements can occur within a certain angle range. The other documents discuss various types of fractures and their characteristics, but do not provide specific information about the angles associated with fractures of Calcaneum, Talus, Navicular, or Cuboid. Therefore, we cannot make an inference based on the provided documents.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"None of the above\"\n}"]
