["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe high dose rate intracavitary brachytherapy for carcinoma of the cervix. The Madison system uses HDR-ICR insertions at weekly intervals. In Part I of the article, it is mentioned that keeping biological effects of external beam and HDR intracavitary in the same ratio as used on a large series of patients treated here with low dose rate (LDR) therapy means keeping the same external beam treatment scheme and finding high dose rate (HDR) doses that are biologically equivalent to the previous LDR therapy, as far as possible. External beam and HDR intracavitary dose schedules for the Madison System of treating cervical carcinoma are described in detail. Part II of the article discusses procedural and physical considerations. There is no specific mention of point A dosing. However, the comparison of 1 vs 2 or more intracavitary brachytherapy applications shows that patients receiving greater than or equal to 2 applications received higher paracentral point doses (p < 0.01). The other articles do not provide information on point A dosing for early and locally advanced cancer cervix during brachytherapy. Therefore, the answer must be based on general knowledge of radiation oncology.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A: 70-75 Gray and 75-80 Gray\"\n}"]
