["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To calculate the Nernst potential for this ion, we need to apply the Nernst equation. The Nernst equation is given by: EN = RT/F * ln([Cout]/[Cin]) where EN is the Nernst potential, R is the gas constant, T is the temperature in Kelvin, F is the Faraday's constant, Cout is the concentration of the ion outside the cell, and Cin is the concentration of the ion inside the cell. Given that the concentration of the negative ion is 100 mMoL extracellular (Cout) and 10 mMo1/1 intracellular (Cin), we can plug in these values into the equation.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
