["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant document provided talks about the analysis of collagen type using the molar ratio Hyp to Hyl. This is mentioned in the first document: 'By using the molar ratio Hyp to Hyl, types I and II of collagen can be differentiated...'. The document also mentions that the elementary collagen molecule consists of three chains rolled into a spiral, and these chains are made up of amino acids. Therefore, we need to find out which amino acid is used in the estimation of collagen.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
