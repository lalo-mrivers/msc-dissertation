["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about spaces in deciduous dentition. The relevant documents are [Occlusion between removable dentures and natural teeth], [From the mixed dentition to the permanent dentition: how to manage space while guiding eruption?], [The distribution of nerves in human deciduous and permanent teeth]. We need to find a connection between these texts and deciduous dentition. From [The construction of cast removable partial dentures with functional-effective structural elements] we can learn that oral examination is crucial for treatment planning, but this doesn't directly relate to the question. From [Light microscopic presentation of the morphological behavior of the nerves of deciduous teeth during tooth exfoliation deciduous and after loss of the dentition] we can see that there are structural changes in the nerve sections located intradentally during tooth exfoliation, which is related to the deciduous dentition. In [The distribution of nerves in human deciduous and permanent teeth], it is mentioned that deciduous teeth have a less dense nerve supply compared to permanent teeth. This implies that deciduous teeth are less sensitive than their permanent successors, but doesn't directly answer our question about spaces.\", \"answer_choice\": D}"]
