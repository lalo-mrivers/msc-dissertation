["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the antiemetic action of metoclopramide. The relevant documents mention that metoclopramide antagonises apomorphine-induced stereotypy in rats and apomorphine reversal of reserpine-induced locomotor suppression in mice, indicating its effect on dopamine receptors. Additionally, it potentiates noradrenaline on the atropine-pretreated taenia coli, rabbit ileum, and rat duodenum. This suggests that metoclopramide's antiemetic action is due to its antagonistic effect on dopamine receptors.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
