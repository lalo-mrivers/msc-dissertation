["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the management of a 32-year-old woman with primary infertility due to bilateral tubal block seen at cornu on hysterosalpingogram. There are no relevant documents provided that relate to this specific condition or procedure. However, we can look for general information on infertility treatments and tubal blockage.
