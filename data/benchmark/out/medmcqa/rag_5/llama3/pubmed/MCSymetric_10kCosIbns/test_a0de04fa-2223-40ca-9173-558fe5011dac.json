["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the urine analysis of a patient with hematuria and hypercalciuria. The relevant documents mention hematuria, but they don't provide information about the type of hematuria (microscopic or macroscopic). However, we can infer that the patient has idiopathic hypercalciuria based on the document 'The use of a test for the differential diagnosis of hypercalciuria'. This suggests that the patient may have absorptive hypercalciuria, which is characterized by excessive urinary calcium excretion. Given this information, it's likely that the urine analysis will show increased RBCs and calcium oxalate crystals, but not nephrotic range proteinuria or eosinophiluria.\",\n\"answer_choice\": A"]
