["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks which hormone acts by crossing cell membrane. From the provided documents, we can see that there is no direct mention of hormones crossing cell membranes. However, one of the documents talks about information being received by cells at their exterior surface in forms of hormones. This suggests that hormones may not directly cross the cell membrane but instead interact with receptors on the cell surface or in the cytoplasm. Based on this reasoning, we can conclude that none of the options A-D represent a hormone that crosses the cell membrane.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
