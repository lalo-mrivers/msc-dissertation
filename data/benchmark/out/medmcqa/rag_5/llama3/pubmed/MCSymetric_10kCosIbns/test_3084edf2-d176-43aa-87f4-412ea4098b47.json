["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the electrophoresis findings in alpha-thalassemia trait. We can look at the relevant documents to determine what the characteristics are of alpha-thalassemia trait. The diagnosis of beta-thalassemia trait mentions that levels of HbA2 and HbF are within normal limits, which is also mentioned in the document on Diagnosis of alpha-thalassemia trait from Coulter Counter 'S' indices. This suggests that electrophoresis shows normal HbA2 and possibly some other characteristic finding.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
