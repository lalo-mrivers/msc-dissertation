["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents mention agoraphobia as a condition characterized by unexpected and situational panic attacks in squares, empty streets, on bridges, and in crowds. This suggests that algophobia is related to the fear of certain situations or spaces, rather than a specific object or entity like animals (option D). The documents also do not mention pain (option C) as a characteristic feature of agoraphobia. Therefore, I will focus on the descriptions of space in the documents. Agoraphobia is described as phobic avoidance, and the presence of agoraphobia has been used to define groups of subjects for clinical research. A review of the evidence suggests that agoraphobia should not be classified with the phobias; several lines of inquiry point to the conclusion that it is a variable feature of patients suffering from anxiety neurosis. Implications for research and problems with the present classification of neurotic affective disorders are noted.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B: Phobia of large space.\""]
