["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to the relevant documents, a technique for open reduction of fractures of the neck of the mandibular condyle was presented, which involves controlling the proximal fragment by inserting a Moule pin into the condylar neck. This facilitates retrieval of the condylar head and alignment of the bone fragments. Accurate anatomical reduction and stabilization are essential components of this technique. Additionally, another document suggests using a brefostem prepared from tubular bones for osteosynthesis, which can fix the fragments and stimulate reparative processes at the site of the fracture.\n\nConsidering these techniques, it is likely that open reduction & fixation of fracture of mandibular condyle is indicated when...\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A: Shortening of ramal height is more than 5 mm\"\n}"]
