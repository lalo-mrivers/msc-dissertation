["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the extraction of a distoangular impaction of mandibular 3rd molar. Based on the provided documents, we can infer that during pre-eruptive movements of the mandibular third molar, growth at the mesial root must dominate for normal uprighting and eruption to occur. In the absence of sufficient space, uprighting movements may result in mesioangular impaction. Since the question is about distoangular impaction, it implies that the extraction might cause a change in the position or angulation of the impacted tooth. The documents also mention that pre-eruptive movements of the mandibular third molar can result in vertical and distoangular impactions. Therefore, the answer lies in understanding the potential changes during extraction.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
