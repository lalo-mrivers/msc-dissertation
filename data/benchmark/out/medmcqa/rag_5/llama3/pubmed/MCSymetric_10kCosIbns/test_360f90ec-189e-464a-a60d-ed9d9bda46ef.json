["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, we need to look at the documents for any information about rabbit weights. In [Anatomical studies on the quantitative development of liver, heart and adrenal glands in white New Zealand rabbits], it mentions that the average body weight was 2.5 kg for the five female pure-bred White New Zealanders examined. This suggests that a common weight for rabbits used in experiments might be around this value. However, we should also consider other documents to confirm or contradict this finding. In [Some results obtained in artificial insemination on a large rabbit farm (author's transl)], there is no mention of specific weights, so it does not provide any additional information. The remaining documents do not contain weight information either. Given that the average body weight mentioned in [Anatomical studies on the quantitative development of liver, heart and adrenal glands in white New Zealand rabbits] seems to be a common value for rabbits used in experiments, we can make an educated guess about the usual weight.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
