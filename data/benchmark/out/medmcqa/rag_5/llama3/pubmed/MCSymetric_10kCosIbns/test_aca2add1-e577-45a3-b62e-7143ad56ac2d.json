["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the strength of a gypsum investment. The relevant documents are [Dilatometry of gypsum bonded investment], [Experimental study on usage and dosage of gypsum], [Thermal behavior of gypsum bonded investments. (Part I) Thermal behavior in heating process] and [Mould-reaction with gypsum bonded refractory investments]. None of these documents mention carbon content, silica content, copper or the strength of a gypsum investment being dependent on these factors. Therefore, we can rule out options A, B, D. The only option left is C: Gypsum.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
