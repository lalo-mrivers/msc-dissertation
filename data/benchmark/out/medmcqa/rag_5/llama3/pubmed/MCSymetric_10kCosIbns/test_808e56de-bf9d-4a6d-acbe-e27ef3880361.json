["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the infratemporal fossa and its contents. The anterior limit of this fossa is mentioned in several places. Specifically, in [Apropos of the infratemporal pre-auricular approach (its value in the approach to the midline skull base], it states that the infratemporal pre-auricular pathway provides very wide access to the median base of the skull while sparing the facial and auditory nerves. This implies that the anterior limit is not the lateral pterygoid plate, maxillary posterior wall, or mastoid process, as these structures would be traversed by the approach. Instead, the anterior limit must be the Pterygomaxillary fissure, which is a natural opening between the maxilla and temporal bone.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"]
