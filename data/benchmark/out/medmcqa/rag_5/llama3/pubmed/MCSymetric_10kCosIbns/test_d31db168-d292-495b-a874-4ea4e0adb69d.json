["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents provided give us information about the angles formed by the axes of the second permanent molars on the plane of bite. We are looking for the shape of the lower 2nd molar. Since there is no specific mention of the shape in the given documents, we can look at other available information. The document [Sequence in calcification and eruption of second premolars and molars--a longitudinal study] provides details about the morphology of second molars. It mentions that there was an analysis of molar tooth form by multivariate analysis of two-dimensional coordinates of datum points defining the occlusal surface and periphery of the crown. This technique proved that discrimination was possible between teeth which could not be discriminated visually or by analysis of the mesiodistal or buccolingual diameters. Therefore, we can infer that the shape of the lower 2nd molar is unique and not easily classified under a specific shape.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
