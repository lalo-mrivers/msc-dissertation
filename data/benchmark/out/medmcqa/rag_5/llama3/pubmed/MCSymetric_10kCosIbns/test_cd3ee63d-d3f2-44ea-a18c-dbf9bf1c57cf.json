["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the bacteria-free zone of dentinal caries. We can start by analyzing the relevant documents. The first document describes the hardness of different carious layers in teeth with chronic dentinal caries, and it suggests that bacterially infected dentin layers should be removed, whereas non-infected layers capable of remineralization should be left. This implies that there is a zone of dentin that is not infected by bacteria. The second document describes the histopathology of arrested root caries lesions and mentions the formation of a distinct sclerosis of the dentinal tubules, which could indicate a bacteria-free zone. The third document suggests that the potential of caries lesions in dentin to become arrested and partially remineralized depends on the severity of an active lesion and its location on the root surface. This implies that there is a bacteria-free zone that can be reached by mineralization. Finally, the fourth document describes the electron microscopic structure of two layers of carious dentin, with the second layer being profound and fuchsinunstainable, indicating a sound collagen fiber zone.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
