["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about reducing patient radiation in intraoral radiographs. The relevant documents describe various methods for reducing radiation dose to patients in different imaging modalities such as xeroradiography and mammography. Since the question specifically asks about intraoral radiographs, we can rule out options that are not related to this modality. The method described in 'Feline oral-dental radiographic examination and interpretation' is the technique of taking intraoral radiographs and developing film. This document does not mention reducing radiation dose to patients. Therefore, option B: Intensifying screens, which is mentioned in this article, cannot be the correct answer. We are left with options A: High speed film, C: Lead apron, D: Decreasing kVp.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
