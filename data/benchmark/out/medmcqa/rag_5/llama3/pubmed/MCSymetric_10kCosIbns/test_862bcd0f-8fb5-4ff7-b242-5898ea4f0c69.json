["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe various methods for measuring blood flow, including the simplified method for measuring regional blood flow, noninvasive measurement of pulsatile blood volume changes, and continuous infusion thermodilution technique. The first method is described as simple in procedure and calculations, but does not specify whether it is a non-invasive method. The second method uses an instrument that measures arterial blood volume changes in a limb segment, which suggests a non-invasive approach. The third method involves cannulae with 1 mum tip openings for pressure measurements and optical transit time methods for flow measurements, but this is invasive. Based on the information provided, the only non-invasive method described is the noninvasive measurement of pulsatile blood volume changes.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
