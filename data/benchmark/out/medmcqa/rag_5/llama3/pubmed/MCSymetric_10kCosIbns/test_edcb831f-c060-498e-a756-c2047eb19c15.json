["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking which option is not seen in neuroimaging of patients with tuberous sclerosis. We need to go through the relevant documents to find the answer. In 'Cerebral angiographic changes associated with tuberous sclerosis', we see that no early venous drainage was observed, but there were pooling of contrast substance and hypervascularity noted. In 'Computed tomography in tuberous sclerosis--with special reference to relation between clinical manifestations and CT findings', we learn about ventricular dilatation, cortical atrophy, nodules, and seizures, but no information is provided about white matter lesion or ependymoma. In 'CT and MR imaging of intracranial tuberous sclerosis', we are told that SEN may be identified in only 80% of patients and tubers are more ubiquitous and readily identified by MR. The rest of the document discusses MRI, CT, and genetic counseling. Finally, in 'Neuroimaging in tuberous sclerosis: a clinicoradiological evaluation in pediatric patients' and '[Tuberous sclerosis: broadening of the diagnosis using MR tomography and computed tomography]', we see descriptions of cortical lesions, subependymal nodules, giant-cell astrocytomas, and seizures, but no mention of white matter lesion or ependymoma. Therefore, based on the information provided, white matter lesion and ependymoma are not seen in neuroimaging of patients with tuberous sclerosis.\", \"answer_choice\": B}"]
