["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the intake of unsaturated fatty acids. We need to analyze the provided documents to find the relationship between unsaturated fatty acid intake and cardiovascular disease risk. From the first document, we know that monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) have a hypocholesterolemic effect, which means they do not induce a decrease in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. This is beneficial for cardiovascular health. Additionally, from the second document, we can see that polyunsaturates also elevate HDL cholesterol and lower LDL cholesterol. Furthermore, the third document shows that higher intake of long-chain (n-3) fatty acids leads to reduced plasma cholesterol concentrations, which is associated with a decreased risk of cardiovascular disease.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B\n}"]
