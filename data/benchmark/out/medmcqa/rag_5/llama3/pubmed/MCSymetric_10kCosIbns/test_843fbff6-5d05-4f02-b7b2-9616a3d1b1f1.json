["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the control of body temperature. From the provided documents, it can be seen that the core-shell concept suggests that skin temperatures are fastest to change, followed by subcutaneous tissue and deeper tissues slower. This implies that there may be a regulatory signal coming from the temperature gradient between subcutaneous tissue and skin. Additionally, the influence of water on the skin surface inhibits sweat secretion, which may explain sweating fatigue. Behavior itself is also considered as an integral part of the thermoregulatory system. The overall mechanism responsible for maintaining a constant body temperature can be described by the theory of the adjustable set point with proportional control. The hypothalamus has been extensively studied and demonstrated to have sensitivity equal to that of other internal temperature sensors.\", \"answer_choice\": D}"]
