["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant document that mentions vulcanization is 'Vulcanism, mercury-sensitized photo-reactions and abiogenetic synthesis: a theoretical treatment.' This document discusses the properties of Periodic Group IIb elements, specifically Hg (mercury), which relates to ultra-violet sensitization in organic chemical reactions. The energy levels of 6(1) P1 and 6(3) P1 resonance states and the high vapor pressure of the metal at temperatures as low as 293 K bring Hg within the range of bond dissociation energies in most organic molecules and many inorganics. This suggests that vulcanization refers to a process involving mercury.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
