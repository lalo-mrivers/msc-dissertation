["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"After reviewing the relevant documents, it is important to note that subdural/extra-arachnoid injection of a local anaesthetic agent during epidural anaesthesia can lead to prolonged duration of anaesthesia and profound hypotension. Additionally, exaggerated epidural blockade resulting from unusual spread of bupivacaine in a patient with low back pain can also cause prolonged duration of anaesthesia. Moreover, the variation in spinal analgesia with plain bupivacaine 0.5% when repeated in the same patient suggests that there is a wide range of height of blocks and increasing with age. Considering these points, it is likely that the bradycardia in this patient is due to the subdural/extra-arachnoid injection of bupivacaine.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
