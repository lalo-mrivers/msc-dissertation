["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the body surface area involved. The document 'The treatment of burns in children' does not provide a specific method for calculating the body surface area. However, it does mention that 'young males who got burnt in and around their homes were most frequently encountered', which suggests that the child's burns are likely to be from a domestic accident. Therefore, we can use the Lund-Browder chart, a widely used method for estimating the body surface area involved in burns, particularly in children. The Lund-Browder chart uses a combination of anatomical and age-related factors to estimate the total body surface area (TBSA) burned.\n\nAccording to the chart, a 2-year-old child with burns involving face, bilateral upper limbs, and front of chest and abdomen would have a TBSA around 45-50%.\n\nThe document 'A review of the complications of burns, their origin and importance for illness and death' does not provide specific details on calculating body surface area. However, it does emphasize the importance of early respiratory involvement in burns, which is relevant to this scenario.\n\nFinally, the document '[Infection control in burned children (author's transl)]' does not provide information on calculating body surface area either.\", \n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
