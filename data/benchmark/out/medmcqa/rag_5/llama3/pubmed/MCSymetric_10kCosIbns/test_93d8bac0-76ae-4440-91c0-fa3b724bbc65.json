["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to the documents, breastfed children have a higher rate of vertical transmission (2.25 odds ratio) compared to never-breastfed children. Therefore, avoiding breastfeeding will decrease mother-to-child transmission of HIV.\\n\\nVaginal delivery is not significantly associated with increased risk of transmission unless it involves procedures like episiotomy, scalp electrodes, forceps, or vacuum extractors, which were not routine in all centers. The study does not suggest that vaginal delivery itself increases the risk.\\n\\nZidovudine given to the mother antenatally and to the neonate after birth is a well-established intervention to reduce vertical transmission.\\n\\nVitamin A supplementation given to the mother has no relation to the risk of mother-to-child transmission of HIV.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
