["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents highlight the central action of caffeine on the central nervous system. According to the 'Caffeine and the central nervous system: mechanisms of action, biochemical, metabolic and psychostimulant effects' document, three main mechanisms of action have been described, but mobilization of intracellular calcium and inhibition of specific phosphodiesterases only occur at high non-physiological concentrations of caffeine. The likely mechanism of action is the antagonism at the level of adenosine receptors. Additionally, the 'Physiologic and psychotropic effects of caffeine on man' document mentions that caffeine increases energy metabolism throughout the brain but decreases cerebral blood flow, inducing a relative brain hypoperfusion.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
