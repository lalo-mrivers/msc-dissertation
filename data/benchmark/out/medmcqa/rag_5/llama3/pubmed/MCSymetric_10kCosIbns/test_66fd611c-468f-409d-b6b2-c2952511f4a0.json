["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the shape of a 1st Maxillary molar. None of the given documents directly mention the shape of the tooth. However, we can infer information from the descriptions of root form and canal anatomy in the Morphologic study of the maxillary molars. The study mentions that complete separation of all three roots was observed on only 18.8% of the third molars, while it was common in the first and second molars. This suggests that the shape of the tooth may be related to the number of roots. Additionally, the study on the internal anatomy of maxillary molars mentions that most teeth had three root canals, which also implies a certain shape or configuration.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
