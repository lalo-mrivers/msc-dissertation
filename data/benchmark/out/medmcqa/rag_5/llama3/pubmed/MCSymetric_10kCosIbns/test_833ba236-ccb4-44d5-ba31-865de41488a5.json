["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the hormones given after resection of posterior pituitary. The relevant documents mention various endocrine functions, but do not provide a specific list of hormones given after such surgery. However, we can consider the normal hormone levels mentioned in [Transsphenoidal surgery in hypersecreting pituitary tumors: endocrine follow-up (author's transl)]. We see that plasma levels of PRL and HGH returned to normal values immediately after selective removal of the pituitary adenoma by transspheno√Ødal route. This suggests that posterior pituitary resection may affect hormone production, but we are not given a list of hormones replaced or supplemented. Therefore, we must rely on general knowledge and common practices in endocrinology. Posterior pituitary is responsible for ADH (antidiuretic hormone) production, which regulates water balance. Given this information, we can infer that after resection of posterior pituitary, ADH replacement might be necessary. Glucagon, Thyroxine, Estradiol, and Mineralocoicoid are all hormones with different functions unrelated to the posterior pituitary. We must look for a hormone related to water balance or posterior pituitary function.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
