["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the condition under which mean and standard deviation can be calculated. According to the provided documents, particularly 'On establishing reference values' and 'Accurate estimation of standard deviations for quantitative methods used in clinical chemistry', it is mentioned that standard deviation is a measure of precision commonly used in clinical chemistry. This implies that the data should be on an interval or ratio scale, as mean and standard deviation are only defined for these types of scales.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
