["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the provided documents, we know that membranes can exhibit viscoplastic flow. This type of flow involves two intrinsic material constants: yield shear and surface viscosity. The yield shear is the maximum shear resultant that the membrane can sustain before it begins to deform irreversibly. In the case of red blood cells adhering to a glass surface, the cell membrane forms thin tethers, and cell detachment from the surface occurs when the shear stress exceeds 10 dynes/cm2. We also know that platelets are much less resistant to shear stress than red cells for relatively long exposure times, but they can still be affected by shear stress. Based on this information, we can conclude that a material turning to liquid on applying critical shear stress is likely exhibiting viscoplastic flow.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
