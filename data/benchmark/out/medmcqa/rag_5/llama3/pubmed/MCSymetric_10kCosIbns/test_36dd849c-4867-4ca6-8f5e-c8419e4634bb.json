["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presented with fever, headache, vomiting, disorientation, and seizures. Neck rigidity was positive, and CECT was normal. The CSF examination revealed a cell count of 300 cells/mm3 with mostly polymorphs, protein 70 mg/dL, sugar 50 mg/dL (blood: 95 mg/dL). Considering the symptoms and lab results, I would think about bacterial meningitis as it fits with the history of fever, headache, vomiting, and neck rigidity. The CSF findings also support this diagnosis, with a high cell count and mostly polymorphs. Tubercular meningitis is less likely given the normal CECT and no specific signs of TB. Herpes encephalitis could be considered but it doesn't fit well with the patient's symptoms and lab results.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
