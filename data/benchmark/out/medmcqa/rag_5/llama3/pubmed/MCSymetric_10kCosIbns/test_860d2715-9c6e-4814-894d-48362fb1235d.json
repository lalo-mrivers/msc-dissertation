["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about repolarization in excitable cells. The relevant documents describe the electrical properties of cells and cell-cell interactions. In particular, the document 'The cell as an electrical circuit' shows that there are definite sites on the membrane surface where the potential equals zero. This suggests that the cell has a resting state or a baseline potential. Repolarization is the process by which the cell returns to this baseline potential after being depolarized (excited). Therefore, repolarization is closely associated with potassium channels opening and potassium ions leaving the cell. This is supported by the document 'Single-channel dose-response studies in single, cell-attached patches', which mentions that K+ ions are involved in modulation of current amplitude. Therefore, the correct answer is...\", \"answer_choice\": \"D: K+ influx\"}"]
