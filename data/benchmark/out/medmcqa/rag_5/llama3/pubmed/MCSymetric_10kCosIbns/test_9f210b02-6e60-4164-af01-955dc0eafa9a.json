["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, let's analyze the given documents. From 'The diameter and number of dentinal tubules in rat, cat, dog and monkey. A comparative scanning electron microscopic study.' we know that the largest number of tubules per unit area was found immediately incisal of the pulp horn. The smallest number cervically, near the enamel. At the pulpal wall the mean number of the tubules ranged from 50,000 to 90,000/mm2. From 'Numerical density and distributional pattern of dentin tubules.' we know that the number of tubules per square millimeter increased more than three times from DEJ to pulp. The diameter of peritubular dentin decreased one-tenth, whereas central distances between tubules were halved from DEJ to pulp.\n\nFrom 'An ultrastructural survey of cat dentinal tubules.' we know that the odontoblast process varies in extent throughout the tooth. No nerve-like processes were found within dentinal tubules in this study. The tubules in the dentine of the cat are more variable in number but narrower than those of man.\n\nFrom 'Dentin permeability.' we know that the dentin tubule is truly a window through which the clinician and the researcher may find answers to a variety of clinical problems.\n\nFrom 'Clinical correlations of dentin structure and function.' we know that the tubules are sometimes so close together in deep dentin that their intrinsic wetness interferes with the bonding of adhesive resins. This permits the formation of gaps, microleakage, dentin sensitivity, and, occasionally, pulpal irritation.\n\nBased on these findings, option B is incorrect because the diameter of dentinal tubules does not range from 5 to 7Î¼m.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
