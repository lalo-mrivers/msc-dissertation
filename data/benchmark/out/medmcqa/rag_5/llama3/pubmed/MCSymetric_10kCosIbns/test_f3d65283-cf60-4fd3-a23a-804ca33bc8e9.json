["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The net filtration pressure is the difference between the capillary hydrostatic pressure (25 mmHg) and the interstitial hydrostatic pressure (2 mmHg), minus the sum of the interstitial oncotic pressure (7 mmHg) and the capillary oncotic pressure. We want to set this difference equal to 3 mmHg, which means that 25 - 2 - (7 + capillary oncotic pressure) = 3. Solving for the capillary oncotic pressure, we get: 20.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
