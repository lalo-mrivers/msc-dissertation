["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the absence of a milestone in a 3-year-old child, which is considered delayed development. None of the options provided (hopping on one leg, drawing a square, feeding by spoon, passing a ball to someone) are directly related to visual milestones or cognitive functions. However, we can consider the relevant documents and previous research. The 'Visual milestones and child development' document mentions that neurologic optimality score shows significant correlations with development of visual milestones. This suggests that delayed development in 3-year-old children might be related to visual or cognitive issues. The 'Medical correlates of infant development' study found no relationship between obstetric and neonatal events and developmental outcome, but did find significant correlations between medical events of later infancy and development at 2 years of age. This implies that delayed development could be influenced by events occurring during the gestational and neonatal periods. Based on this information, we can infer that delayed development in a 3-year-old child is more likely related to cognitive or visual milestones rather than motor skills.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
