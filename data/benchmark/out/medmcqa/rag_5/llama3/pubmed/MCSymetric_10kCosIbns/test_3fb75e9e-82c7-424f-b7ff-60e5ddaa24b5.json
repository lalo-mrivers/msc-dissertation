["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the induction of inhalational agent. The passage 'Inhalation chambers' discusses the problem of small amounts of active substance deposited in the mouth and pharynx with metered-dose pressurised aerosols, which can be solved by using an inhalation chamber. This suggests that the inhalation chamber increases lung deposition, reduces ENT deposition, and makes coordination unnecessary. The passage 'Advantages and difficulties of aerosol therapy' also discusses the advantage of the airways route in aerosol therapy, where treatment effects are obtained without systemic effects. This does not provide information about the speed of induction.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
