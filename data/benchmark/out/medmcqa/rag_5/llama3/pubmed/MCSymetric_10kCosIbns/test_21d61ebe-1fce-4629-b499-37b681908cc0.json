["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the ideal management of a woman with infertility who has bilateral cornual block on hysterosalpingography. Cornual block refers to obstruction of the fallopian tubes at their proximal end, which is the case in interstitial pregnancies. Interstitial pregnancy following ipsilateral salpingo-oophorectomy was previously discussed and shows that internal (transuterine) migration of the fertilized ovum is the most probable explanation for this ectopic gestation. This means that the ideal management would not involve opening or reconstructing the blocked fallopian tubes, but rather address the underlying cause of infertility. Considering the patient has bilateral cornual block, a surgical intervention to open or reconstruct both tubes may not be effective. Instead, alternative methods like in-vitro fertilization (IVF) might be more suitable.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
