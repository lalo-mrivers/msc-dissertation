["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the provided documents, it is evident that intrafusal muscle fibers are found within the sensory region of a muscle spindle. The architecture and innervation pattern of these fibers suggest that they may fail to accomplish differentiation at an early stage of development, retaining immature features into adulthood. Further studies revealed the presence of three types of intrafusal muscle fibers: single-innervated, multiple-innervated, and fibers with both types of innervation. The histochemical activities of myofibrillar adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase), succinic dehydrogenase (SDH) and alpha glycerophosphate dehydrogenase (alpha-GPD) were studied in intrafusal muscle fibres of rat fast and slow muscles.\n\nThe response of fast and slow nuclear bag fibres and nuclear chain fibres in isolated cat muscle spindles to fusimotor stimulation, and the effect of intrafusal contraction on the sensory endings. 1. The mechanical behaviour of intrafusal muscle fibres during fusimotor stimulation and passive stretch was observed directly in muscle spindles isolated from the cat tenuissimus muscle.\n\nA technique for studies of the contractile apparatus in single human muscle fibre segments obtained by percutaneous biopsy. Human muscle samples were obtained with the percutaneous biopsy technique. The force generating-capacity, the sensitivity of the contractile apparatus to calcium and the caffeine threshold for calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum could be studied in the short muscle fibre segments obtained from man with the percutaneous muscle biopsy technique.\n\nFrom these studies, it is clear that intrafusal fibres have a specific function within the muscle spindle.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: Both\""]
