["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the radiopacity that frequently obliterate the root apices of maxillary molars. We need to analyze the anatomy of maxillary molars to find the answer. From the provided documents, we know that maxillary first and second molars have lingual roots curving towards the buccal. This indicates that the roots are more likely to be curved inwards rather than extending outwards. Therefore, it is unlikely that the palatine bone or the orbital process of Zygomatic bone would obliterate the root apices. The maxillary sinus and zygoma and zygomatic process of Maxilla are both more likely candidates.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
