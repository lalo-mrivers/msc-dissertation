["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the cortex of lymph node. We need to find a relevant document that describes the structure of the cortex. In [The morphofunctional characteristics of the vascular bed of the lymph nodes], it's mentioned that the morphology bases for better exchange between blood and lymph are demonstrated in the cortex of the lymph node. This suggests that the cortex is involved in the process of lymphocyte circulation. However, there is no mention of specific structures like cords, Hassall's corpuscles, or nodules. In [Cellular composition of the deep cervical and apical axillary lymph nodes in mature and aged humans], it's mentioned that the follicles are more homogeneous structural components and consist mainly of lymphocytes. This suggests that the cortex may contain lymphoid noduli as described in [The morphofunctional characteristics of the vascular bed of the lymph nodes]. There is no mention of white pulp, which is a term used to describe the lymphoid tissue in the spleen. Therefore, we can conclude that the cortex contains lymphoid noduli.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
