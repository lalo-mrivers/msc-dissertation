["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the anatomical characteristics of molar teeth root furcations. The study found that 94% of the furcations possessed variant depth of developmental concavities on the root trunks, which may prevent complete adaptation of the coronal microstructure of the Teflon membrane along their root surfaces. Another study showed that from first to second molar, the radicular angle, root length and furcal area width undergo a reduction; differently radicular trunk increases his length. On the basis of this results, we can infer that the second upper molar is the most frequently extracted tooth due to its complex anatomy.\n\nConsidering the given options, we are looking for the tooth with bifurcated roots. The study on anatomical characteristics of root furcations in molar teeth suggests that the upper second molar has a unique anatomy characterized by a long radicular trunk, which is associated with a more apical placement of the furcation entrance and a narrow inter-radicular angle.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be related to this tooth. The relevant study on tooth morphology following root resection procedures in maxillary first molars suggests that the Disto-Buccal root is the most commonly resected root in maxillary molars, but it does not provide information about bifurcated roots.\n\nAnother document describes the connective tissue cells of the dentinal pulp of unerupted dog teeth, which possess occasional cilia. However, this information is not relevant to the current question.\n\nFinally, we have a clinical case summary of a patient with an upper lateral incisor with two root canals. This information suggests that the tooth may have an anatomical anomaly in the root that includes a complex root canal system, but it does not provide information about bifurcated roots.\n\nConsidering all these factors, we should look for the answer among the given options. The study on anatomical characteristics of root furcations in molar teeth suggests that the upper second molar has a unique anatomy characterized by a long radicular trunk and a narrow inter-radicular angle, which is associated with bifurcated roots.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be related to this tooth. We cannot find any information about bifurcated roots for the other options (A, B, C, D). Therefore, our answer should be C: Mand. central incisor, but this option does not match our analysis of anatomical characteristics of root furcations in molar teeth.\n\nConsidering all these factors, we can infer that the correct answer is the one that matches the unique anatomy characterized by a long radicular trunk and a narrow inter-radicular angle associated with bifurcated roots. We can find this information only in the study on anatomical characteristics of root furcations in molar teeth, which suggests that the upper second molar has such an anatomy.\n\nTherefore, our answer should be D: Mandibular premolar.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
