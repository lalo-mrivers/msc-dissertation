["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking what to advise a pregnant female with known cardiac disease who has history of warfarin embryopathy. The documents highlight the teratogenic effects of warfarin on fetal development, particularly in the first trimester. The risk of fetal or embryonal teratogenic injury is about 25-30% if Coumarol derivatives are given through the 6th to the 9th week of pregnancy. To avoid those injuries, Heparin can be used for anticoagulant therapy and Coumarol itself should be used in the lowest possible therapeutic dose.
