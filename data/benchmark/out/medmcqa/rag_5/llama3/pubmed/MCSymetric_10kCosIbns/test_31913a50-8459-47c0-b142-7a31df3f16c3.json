["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"After reviewing the provided documents, I didn't find any specific information related to sensory endings. However, the documents provide insights into various aspects of perception, memory, and sensation. The hypothesis on information, memory, and perception suggests that uncertainty about an external event leads to neural activity, which is different from traditional mapping processes. The document on associations to odors discusses how initial associations are retained better than second-learned ones and how verbal labeling can aid in remembering odors. Additionally, the documents cover topics like standardized examination methods for smell and taste, functional investigation of the sense of smell, and representation of reality in the perceptual world.\n\nHowever, I didn't find any information that directly addresses sensory endings or their characteristics. It's possible that these documents are not comprehensive enough to provide specific details about sensory endings. Therefore, it seems reasonable to analyze the potential choices provided:\n\nA: Annulospiral wrap the ends - Not mentioned in the provided documents.\nB: Primary ending is annulospiral - Not mentioned in the provided documents.\nC: Primary ending conducts 1a fibres - This statement doesn't seem accurate based on the available information.\n\nGiven this analysis, I can confidently conclude that:\n\nD: Flower spray is secondary - Unmentioned in the provided documents and seems unrelated to sensory endings.\n\nBased on my step-by-step thinking, I recommend choosing answer C: Primary ending conducts 1a fibres as the false statement regarding sensory endings."]
