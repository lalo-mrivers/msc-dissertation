["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the spring-back behavior of super-elastic NiTi and non-super-elastic NiTi wires. From the documents, we know that super-elastic NiTi wires are capable of withstanding very large deflections and on returning to their original shape on deactivation will produce more moderate forces. This suggests that these wires have a greater spring-back in bending. On the other hand, non-super-elastic NiTi wires do not exhibit this property and only show good spring-back properties only; load is nearly proportional to deflection. Therefore, it can be inferred that the spring back in bending is much greater for superelastic NiTi wires than non-superelastic NiTi.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
