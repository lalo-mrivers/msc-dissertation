["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the structure of glycogen and its synthesis by incubating D-[14C]glucose with rabbit-liver glycogen. The document also describes the effects of glucagon and insulin on net hepatic metabolism of glucose precursors in sheep. However, none of these documents directly relate to the question about glucogenic substances.\n\nFrom the provided options, we can determine which compounds are involved in glycolysis or gluconeogenesis processes. Pyruvate is a product of glycolysis, lactate is a product of anaerobic glycolysis, and oxaloacetate is an intermediate in the citric acid cycle and can be converted to phosphoenolpyruvate through the action of pyruvate carboxylase.\n\nOn the other hand, Acetyl-CoA is not directly involved in glycolysis or gluconeogenesis. It is a product of beta-oxidation of fatty acids and can be used for energy production or cholesterogenic synthesis.\n\nTherefore, based on our analysis, we can conclude that Acetyl-CoA is not glucogenic.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
