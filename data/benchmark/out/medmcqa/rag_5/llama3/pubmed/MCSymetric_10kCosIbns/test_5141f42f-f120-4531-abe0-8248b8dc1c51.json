["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the patient's age (6 years old) and the presence of HbF (90%) and HbA2 (3%), it is likely that this patient has sickle cell anemia. The presence of HbF in high percentage (>80% is characteristic of sickle cell disease. Given that anemia is present, we can expect to see some abnormal red blood cells on the peripheral smear.\n\nLooking at the options, A refers to the presence of target cells and B refers to the presence of sickled cells. C refers to the presence of macrocytes (large RBCs). Considering the patient's age and the findings on electrophoresis, it is likely that we will see some abnormal red blood cells on the peripheral smear.\n\nThe production of erythrocytes that contain fetal hemoglobin in anemia states suggests that individuals with sickle cell anemia can have a high percentage of F-cells (>80%) which would be consistent with our findings.\n\nGiven this information, we are most likely to see A and B (target cells and sickled cells) on the peripheral smear.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
