["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking which factor would favour Respiratory Distress Syndrome (RDS) in a term gestation newborn. From the provided documents, it seems that RDS is associated with prolonged rupture of amniotic membranes and maternal hypertension in infants with birthweights between 1,501 and 2,500 gm or gestational ages of 33 to 36 weeks. In addition, meconium-stained amniotic fluid has been found to be a risk factor for RDS. The documents do not mention antenatal corticosteroids as a significant risk factor for RDS.\n\nThe air bronchogram on chest x-ray is an imaging finding commonly seen in RDS patients, but it's not a risk factor per se. Onset of distress after 6 hours of birth could be related to other conditions besides RDS. Finally, term birth can be associated with RDS, especially if the pregnancy was complicated by meconium-stained amniotic fluid or other risk factors.\n\nTherefore, based on the provided information, I would favour Option D: Term birth as a factor that would favour Respiratory Distress Syndrome (RDS) in this newborn.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
