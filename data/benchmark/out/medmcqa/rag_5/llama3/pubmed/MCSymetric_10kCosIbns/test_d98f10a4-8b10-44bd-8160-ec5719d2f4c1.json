["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about heart sounds during pregnancy. The provided documents are related to fetal development and hearing impairment. From the studies, we can see that fetal heart rate response to acoustic stimulation is a normal finding during pregnancy. Specifically, in one study, it is mentioned that roughly 50% of fetuses tested started to react with an increased heart rate in the 24th week of development, and by the 28th week, all tested subjects responded to the test stimuli. This suggests that the fetal heart rate response to acoustic stimulation is a normal finding during pregnancy.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
