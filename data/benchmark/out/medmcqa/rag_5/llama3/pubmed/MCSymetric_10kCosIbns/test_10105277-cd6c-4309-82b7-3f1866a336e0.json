["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe various respiratory functions and responses to different conditions. The key factor is the effect on the pulmonary function in COPD patients. According to [Short-term effects of respiration with external negative ventilation --shield-type respirator-- on the pulmonary function in COPD], intermittent rest of respiratory muscles through a negative pressure external respirator can lead to an improvement in maximum inspiratory pressure and a decrease in partial pressure of CO2 in arterial blood, which suggests that a high level of CO2 may stimulate the respiratory centre. This is supported by [Reaction of the human ventilatory apparatus to supplementary respiratory resistance upon inhalation of normo- and hypercapnic mixtures], where an increase in CO2 tension in exhaled air was found.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
