["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the first enzyme to rise in myocardial infarction. According to the document 'Quantitation of infarct size in man by means of plasma enzyme levels', the enzymes used in this study are: lactate dehydrogenase (LDH); alpha-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase (alpha-HBDH); aspartate aminotransferase (GOT); creatine phosphokinase (CPK); and phosphohexoseisomerase (PHI). The document 'Serum and myocardial enzyme activity in experimental myocardial infarct' states that the activity of heart muscle enzymes decreases significantly and persistently in the zone of necrosis, with individual enzymes being unequally sensitive to the effects of the given injuring factor. This suggests that LDH might be the first enzyme to rise as it is mentioned alongside other enzymes.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
