["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about a non-centrally distributed rash. From the given documents, we know that systemic infections can be recognized by characteristic skin lesions. The butterfly rash is mentioned as a sign of Systemic lupus erythematosus and Lupus vulgaris/Lupus pernio, but it's not related to any infection causing a non-centrally distributed rash. We also see that Erysipelas produces brawny, fiery red facial lesions which are centrally distributed. Malar flush is mentioned as a feature of several disorders, including Carcinoid syndrome and graft-versus-host disease, but these are not infections either. The document about Drug-induced allergic skin reactions mentions various types of cutaneous vascular reactions, some of which may be non-centrally distributed, but the text does not specify any particular infection. Looking at the question again, we see that typhoid is mentioned as one of the options, and it's an infection known to cause a rash. This leads us to suspect that the correct answer might be related to typhoid. Finally, we read about Columnar epidermal necrosis which resembles some aspects of Kyrle's disease or Mucha-Haberman's disease, but this does not seem directly related to infections.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
