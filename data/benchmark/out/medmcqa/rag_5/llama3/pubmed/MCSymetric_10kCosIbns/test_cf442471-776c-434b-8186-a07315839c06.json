["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the percentage of accessory canals found in the apical third of the root. The documents provided give information on the anatomy of dog teeth (apical root canal anatomy) and human teeth (Morphological analysis of lower permanent incisor roots). We are looking for a specific percentage mentioned in the text related to human tooth roots. After searching through the texts, we find that Morphological analysis of lower permanent incisor roots mentions that 36.1% of the sample displayed multiple root canals. Since the question is asking about the apical third specifically, we can conclude that this percentage might be relevant. However, without further information from the text, it's difficult to determine whether this percentage refers to accessory canals in the apical third.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
