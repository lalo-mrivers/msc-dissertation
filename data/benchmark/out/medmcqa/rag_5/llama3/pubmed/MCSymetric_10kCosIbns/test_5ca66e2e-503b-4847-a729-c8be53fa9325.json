["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the interaction of Salmonella typhi with cells of the body and macrophage cultures. In one study, homogenates of lymphoid and myeloid tissues, as well as macrophages and polymorphonuclears, possessed bactericidal activity against S. typhi. This suggests that monocytes (a type of white blood cell) may play a role in the immune response to S. typhi infection. Additionally, a study on Typhoid gamma G, gamma M and gamma A antibodies in persons with different relation to the typhoid infection shows that the amount of specific antibodies was calculated from the differences in the levels of serum IgG, IgM and IgA before and after absorption with purified O, Vi and H antigens. This suggests that monocytes may be involved in the immune response to S. typhi infection.\n\nFurthermore, a study on cyclic thrombocytopenia with chronic thyroiditis and ankylosing spondylitis does not provide any information related to increased monocytic count in Typhoid.\n\nFinally, a study on Relative sensitivity of blood and bone marrow cultures in typhoid fever shows that bone marrow culture proved to be the most sensitive diagnostic test for typhoid fever. However, this study does not provide any information related to monocytes.\n\nTherefore, based on these studies, increased Monocytic count is seen in Typhoid.\",\n\"answer_choice\": A"]
