["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about a major drawback of pro-root MTA, which is its increased setting time. The options provided are additives that could potentially decrease the setting time. Since there is no information directly related to pro-root MTA or its setting time in the given documents, we need to rely on general knowledge of root canal treatments and irrigants. From the document [High volume vs. activated root canal irrigation], it can be inferred that activated continuous irrigation has a positive effect, particularly in the apical section. This information suggests that activation might be involved in decreasing the setting time. However, there is no direct connection between this information and the options provided. Therefore, we need to rely on general knowledge of chemistry and materials science.\n\nIn general, activators or accelerants are substances added to a mixture to speed up its setting process. Sodium hydroxide (NaOH) is known for its ability to accelerate the setting of some materials, including MTA. Therefore, option A: 3% of NaOH seems to be the most plausible solution to decrease the increased setting time of pro-root MTA.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
