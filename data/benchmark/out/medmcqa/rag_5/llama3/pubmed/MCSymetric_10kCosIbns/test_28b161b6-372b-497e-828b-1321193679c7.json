["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the forces acting through a fixed partial denture on the abutment tooth. In the given documents, we can find information about forces transmitted to abutment teeth of removable partial dentures. Specifically, in the document 'Anterior rests for maxillary removable partial dentures', it is mentioned that distobuccal forces on the extension base adversely affected the primary canine abutment. This suggests that the forces should not be parallel to the long axis of the teeth. Additionally, in the document 'The measurement of forces transmitted to abutment teeth of removable partial dentures', it is stated that extension bases apply mesially directed forces to abutment teeth during mastication. This further supports the idea that the forces should not be parallel to the long axis of the teeth. Therefore, the forces acting through a fixed partial denture on the abutment tooth should be directed away from the long axis of the teeth.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
