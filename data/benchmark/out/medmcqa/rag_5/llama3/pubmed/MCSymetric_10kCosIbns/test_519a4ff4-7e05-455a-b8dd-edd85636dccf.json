["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks which option is NOT true regarding teeth features and ethnicity. We need to analyze the provided documents for information about teeth features and ethnicity. From 'Dental variation among populations' we know that there is considerable variation between and within populations with regard to tooth size, age of eruption, congenitally missing teeth, and crown morphology. This document does not mention any specific ethnic group or its characteristics. The other two documents do provide some information about different ethnic groups, but they are more focused on the development and evolution of dental traits rather than specific features. Based on this analysis, we can conclude that the option mentioning a specific ethnic group (Mongolians) is not true regarding teeth features and ethnicity.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
