["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The main idea behind pontic design is to restore masticatory and phonetic functions, as well as esthetics. Pontics usually present a larger surface than natural teeth; on this surface, plaque may accumulate. The self-cleaning mechanisms are ineffective on the surfaces facing the adjacent teeth or the tissues of the alveolar ridge. For this reason, the pontics and their flexible or rigid connectors to the abutments must be considered the weakest parts of the restoration. Therefore, an optimal pontic design should take into account the individuality of each situation, considering periodontal prevention and postinsertion periodontal care.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
