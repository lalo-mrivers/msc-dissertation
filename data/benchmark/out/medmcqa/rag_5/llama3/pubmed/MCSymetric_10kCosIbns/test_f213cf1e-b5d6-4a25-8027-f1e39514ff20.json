["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has a bilateral body fracture. Since the question doesn't specify the type of cancer, we can refer to general information about bone metastases. The relevant documents suggest that patients with pathological fractures and terminal cancer should be treated surgically if the fracture is fixed and stable, and the patient's general condition permits. In this case, considering the patient's age (75), diabetes, and edentulous status, a more conservative approach might be more suitable.\n\nThe question doesn't mention anything about malignancies or metastases, so we can focus on treating the fracture. The documents describe various techniques for treating fractures in older patients, such as hip para-articular fractures in patients over 100 years old. Two mini plates could provide sufficient stabilization and allow for early mobilization.\n\nHowever, considering the patient's age and comorbidities, a more straightforward approach with fewer hardware components might be beneficial. Wire osteosynthesis is a simpler technique that can stabilize the fracture without requiring extensive reconstruction or multiple plates.\n\nGunning splints are not typically used in modern orthopedic surgery and are not a recommended treatment option for this patient.\n\nORIF (open reduction internal fixation) with a reconstruction plate may be overkill for this patient's bilateral body fracture, especially considering their age and comorbidities. A more conservative approach might be more suitable.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
