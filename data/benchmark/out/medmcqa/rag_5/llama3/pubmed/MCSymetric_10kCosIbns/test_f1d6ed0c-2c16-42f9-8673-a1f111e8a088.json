["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the functional classification of human muscles that determine mandibular movements. The classification reflects anatomical, topographical, and histogenetic peculiarities of the muscles. A new functional classification is presented, with two groups of muscles: direct and mediated action on the mandible. Direct acting muscles include temporalis, masseter, lateral pterygoid, medial pterygoid, and others. Among these, temporalis and medial pterygoid muscles are known to elevate the mandible. Therefore, it is likely that the muscle that helps in depressing the mandible is the opposite group of muscles that has not been mentioned as elevating the mandible. Lateral pterygoid is one such muscle.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
