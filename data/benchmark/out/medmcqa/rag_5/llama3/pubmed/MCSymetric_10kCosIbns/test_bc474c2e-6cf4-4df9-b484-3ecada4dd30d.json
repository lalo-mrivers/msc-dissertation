["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the documents provided, we can see that muscle spindles are sensitive to stretch (Histochemical and morphological changes in human muscle spindle in upper and lower motor neuron lesions) and respond to muscle contraction (Responses of muscle spindles in a tortoise). The primary ending of muscle spindle in man shows dynamic and static sensitivity to stretch, but the dynamic and vibratory sensitivities as well as conduction velocity of the afferent fibres seem to be relatively low in comparison to those described in the cat. This suggests that muscle spindles are sensitive to both stretch and contraction. Additionally, the responses of muscle spindles in the cat show that most spindle endings could be classified as either primary or secondary by a constellation of physiological criteria including dynamic response pattern, dynamic index, and variability of resting discharge frequency.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
