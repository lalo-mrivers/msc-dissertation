["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the binding of eukaryotic mRNA to ribosomes. The documents provided suggest that the process of initiation complex formation involves the 5' end of the mRNA and the 3' end of the 16S RNA, which base pairs with the polypurine stretch common to initiator regions in E. coli and bacteriophage mRNAs. This suggests that the poly-A tail is not directly involved in the binding process. The documents also suggest that ribosomes first bind to the 5' end of the mRNA independently of AUG, then advance to the AUG initiation codon, where protein synthesis ensues. Therefore, it can be concluded that the binding of eukaryotic mRNA to ribosomes is facilitated by the recognition of the poly-A tail.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
