["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents discuss various aspects of dentures and their interactions with natural teeth. We are looking for the point of contact between opposing natural teeth in centric occlusion. The provided options suggest different positions. Let's analyze each option: A refers to maxillary posterior teeth, B mentions maxillary posterior teeth as well, but specifically buccal cusps, C points to mandibular posterior teeth and their lingual slopes. Considering the documents, we can deduce that normal dentition would place the crest of the residual ridge lingually to the position of the remaining teeth in both the maxilla and mandible (document 1). This information helps us eliminate options A and B as they imply buccal or facial positioning, which is not consistent with the described anatomical relationship. Option C mentions lingual slopes, which would also be inconsistent with the residual ridge's lingual positioning. Therefore, we are left with no clear option that corresponds to normal dentition in centric occlusion.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
