["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The studies mentioned anticholinergic drugs such as atropine, hyoscine, and glycopyrronium. The survey on current usage of preanaesthetic medication also mentions the use of atropine and hyoscine. However, it is stated that 'anticholinergic premedication was used by only 36% in adults and 56% in children' and that the routine use of anticholinergic drugs appears to be unnecessary. Therefore, it can be inferred that these anticholinergic drugs are not commonly used as pre-anesthetic medication. The studies also mention sedative-hypnotic premedication which includes temazepam and trimeprazine. Additionally, a combination of butorphanol with promethazine and atropamine is mentioned to be safe and useful for pre-anaesthetic medication. Hence, it can be concluded that the most commonly used as pre-anesthetic medication is likely to be one of these sedative-hypnotic agents.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
