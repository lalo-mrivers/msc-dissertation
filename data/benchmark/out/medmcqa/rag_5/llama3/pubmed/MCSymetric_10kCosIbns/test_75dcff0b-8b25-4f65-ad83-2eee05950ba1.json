["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe centric relation and its relationship to centric occlusion. The TMJ series shows that centric occlusion is a strained position and is usually lateral to and postero-superior to centric relation, indicating that the mandible is displaced in centric occlusion. This suggests that when there is a prematurity in centric occlusion but not in eccentric or other movements, it may be related to the TMJ series. The documents also describe how the condyles are in centric relation when they are in the most superior position possible in the fossae, which can be verified through careful bilateral manipulation and palpation.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
