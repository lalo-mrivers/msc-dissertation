["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about congenital diseases in diabetes mellitus. From the documents provided, we know that 57% of infants born to diabetic women had congenital malformations, which is a rate three to four times higher than in the normal population. We also know that cardiovascular and skeletal abnormalities were equally common, with a high incidence of anencephalus, spina bifida, transposition of the great vessels, and sacral dysgenesis. In another study, 12% of babies born to diabetic mothers had major malformations, which was higher than in the control group.\n\nComparing this information to the options provided, we can see that none of them match exactly with the findings from the documents. However, option B is closest as it mentions an association with major congenital abnormality, which is consistent with the studies mentioned earlier.\n\nOption A refers to free radical injury, which is not mentioned in any of the documents. Options C and D are also not supported by the information provided.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B: 6-10% cases are associated with major congenital abnormality.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
