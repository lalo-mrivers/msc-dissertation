["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the minimum sample size required for the study, we need to use the formula from the paper 'The estimation of disease frequency using a population sample' (1978). The formula is: n = (z^2 * p * q) / e^2, where n is the minimum sample size, z is the Z-score corresponding to the desired confidence level (95%), p is the estimated prevalence (0.5), q is the complement of p (1-p), and e is the error margin (0.005 for a 95% confidence interval). Plugging in the values, we get: n = (1.96^2 * 0.5 * 0.5) / 0.005^2 = approximately 384.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
