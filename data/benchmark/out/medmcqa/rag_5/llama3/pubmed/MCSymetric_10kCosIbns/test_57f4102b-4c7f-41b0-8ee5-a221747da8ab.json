["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The provided documents describe the immune status of patients with acute and exacerbated chronic periodontitis. The assessment reveals changes in local immunity, particularly in the material from the involved tooth gingival groove, where both quantitative parameters and cellular functional activity were changed. Reagin-like activity of serum in human peridonotal disease shows that patients with periodontitis make immunoglobulin E antibodies to plaque constituents. This suggests cell-mediated immune reactions (delayed hypersensitivity) occur in periodontitis. T lymphocytes are reduced in the acute phase, which further supports this conclusion.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
