["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking which of the options is not an obstructive cause of mouth breathing. The relevant documents describe various factors that can lead to mouth breathing, including nasal obstruction, airway resistance, and upper airway obstruction. Based on these descriptions, we can infer that Deviated nasal septum (A), Obstructive adenoids (D) are both potential causes of mouth breathing due to nasal or upper airway obstruction. On the other hand, Short lip (B) is not directly related to obstructive causes of mouth breathing, as it would affect the oral cavity rather than the nasal or upper airway. Narrow maxilla (C) could potentially cause mouth breathing if it leads to upper airway obstruction, but this is less clear compared to the other options. Therefore, we can conclude that Short lip (B) is not an obstructive cause of mouth breathing.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
