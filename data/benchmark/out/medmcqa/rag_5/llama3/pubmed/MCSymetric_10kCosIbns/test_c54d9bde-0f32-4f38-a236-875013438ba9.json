["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about what happens when VDO (venous return) increases. Based on the documents provided, specifically the first document 'In vitro flow characteristics of a new pump with a high inherent sensitivity to venous return.', we can see that the differential displacement pump shows a high sensitivity to filling pressure in the range of 2.3-9.6 L/min/mmHg, indicating that it is sensitive to changes in VDO.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
