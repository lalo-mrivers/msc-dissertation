["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the glazing of a layer crack. Looking at the provided documents, I can see that there is no mention of thermal shock or contamination causing glazing of a layer crack. The document on ceramics suggests that the surface quality may be compromised due to dull glow, which might relate to this question. However, it's not directly related to glazing of a layer crack.
