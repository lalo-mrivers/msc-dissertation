["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has a Guthrie test that is positive, which suggests the presence of phenylketonuria (PKU). PKU is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by a deficiency of the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase. This deficiency leads to the accumulation of phenylalanine in the blood and urine. The patient's physical characteristics, such as blue eyes, blonde hair, and fair skin, are not specific to PKU. However, the Guthrie test result suggests that the patient has a high level of phenylalanine in their blood, which is consistent with PKU.\n\nVomiting and malnutrition are common symptoms of untreated PKU. The study on urinary tract infections in early infancy does not seem relevant to this case, as it discusses the characteristics of UTIs in newborns, whereas this patient has already presented at an older age. Scanty intestinal gas and radiology of acute surgical abdomen may be important for diagnosing other conditions, but they do not directly relate to PKU.\n\nThe study on hypoglycemia and microgastria mentions a child with small stomach who was treated with continuous intragastric infusion, but it does not provide information about phenylalanine levels or Guthrie tests. The study on unspecified changes in the small intestinal mucosa discusses chronic diarrhea and failure to thrive in infants and children, which is also unrelated to this case.\n\nBased on these findings, it seems that options A, B, C, and D are all related to PKU. However, option B, White patch of hair due to tryptophan deficiency, does not seem to be a correct statement about PKU. Therefore, the answer should be B.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
