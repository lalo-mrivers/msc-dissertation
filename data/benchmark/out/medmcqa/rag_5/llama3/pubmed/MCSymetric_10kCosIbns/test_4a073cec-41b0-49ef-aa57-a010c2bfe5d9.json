["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks which sensation is NOT perceived by the spinal nucleus of the trigeminal nerve. Based on the provided documents, it's clear that the trigeminal nerve has sensory fibers that transmit information about pain, temperature, and touch. The documents also mention that the accessory (aberrant) sensory fibers run between the motor and main sensory roots, which suggests that these fibers may be responsible for transmitting somatic sensation. However, proprioception is not mentioned as a function of the trigeminal nerve. Therefore, the answer must be D: Proprioception.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
