["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about what is NOT carried by the dorsal column. The relevant documents discuss the functions of the dorsal column. In [Dual dorsal columns: a review], it's mentioned that the literature supports Wall's view that dorsal column lesions cause motor disturbances, but not sensory defects. This suggests that the dorsal column plays a role in proprioception and vibration, as these are related to motor function. In [Dorsal column stimulation and its prospects], the implantation of electrodes in the dorsal column for pain relief is discussed, suggesting that pain can be carried by the dorsal column. Finally, [Anatomo-topographical and structural aspects of the dorsal nucleus (Clarke's nucleus) in humans] describes the morphology of the dorsal column, but does not specifically discuss touch.\n\nConsidering these points, it seems that all of the options A-D are carried by the dorsal column, except for one: Touch.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
