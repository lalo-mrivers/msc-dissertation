["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the type of scale used to categorize patients into three categories. The Child Pugh score is described as 'A scoring system for sick children' with a scoring chart that shows an inverse correlation with the severity of illness. This suggests that the score has some degree of ordering or ranking, but it does not imply continuous measurement. Therefore, options B and D can be eliminated. Option C, Quantitative, may seem plausible at first glance, but the description does not suggest that the score is measured on a numerical scale. Option A, Nominal, is more likely to describe the type of categorization used in the Child Pugh score.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
