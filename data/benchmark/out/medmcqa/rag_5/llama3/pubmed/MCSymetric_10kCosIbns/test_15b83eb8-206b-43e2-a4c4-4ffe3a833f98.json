["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to the first document 'Optical transmittance of reflecting wedges', it is stated that the cervical wedges reflected 180 degrees and the original light intensity diminished by 83.9%. The maximal light intensity transmitted to the resin by the wedge was less than 8% of that receiving direct exposure to the curing wand. This suggests that the light transmitting wedges transmit a very small percentage of incident light, specifically less than 8%. This information is used to make an educated guess about the correct answer.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
