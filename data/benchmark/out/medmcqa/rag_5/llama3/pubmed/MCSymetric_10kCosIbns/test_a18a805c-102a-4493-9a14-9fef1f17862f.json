["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The Widal test is a serological test used to diagnose typhoid fever. It detects the presence of antibodies against Salmonella Typhi. To answer this question, we need to consider each option and its relation to the Widal test.\\n\\nOption A: Base lines differ depending on the endemicity of the disease - This statement is true. The Widal test results can vary based on the prevalence of typhoid fever in the population.\\n\\nOption B: O antibodies last longer and hence is not indicative of recent infection - This statement is true as well. The IgG antibodies produced by the body in response to typhoid infection persist for a long time, making them less useful in diagnosing recent infections.\\n\\nOption C: H antigen cannot differentiate between subtypes - This statement is also true. The Widal test detects the presence of O and H antigens, but it cannot distinguish between different serotypes or subtypes of Salmonella Typhi.\\n\\nOption D: High titre value in a single Widal test is not confirmative - This statement is false. A high titre value in a single Widal test can be indicative of recent infection, especially when combined with other clinical and laboratory findings.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
