["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks which hormone is controlled by feedforward control. We need to identify the hormones mentioned in the documents that are controlled through feedforward mechanisms. In the document 'Metabolic feedback in mammalian endocrine systems', it is mentioned that stress activates adrenal cortical and medullary secretion, which also promotes lipolysis, but in this case the liberated free fatty acids may actually stimulate the system further (feed-forward). This suggests that glucocorticoids are controlled through feedforward mechanisms. Furthermore, in another section of the same document, it is mentioned that glucose has been shown to directly inhibit the activity of several different endocrine pathways, and must now be considered an integral part of the overall regulatory mechanism involved in fine-tuning secretion and possibly production of hormones. This suggests that insulin might also be controlled through feedforward mechanisms.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: Prolactin\"\n}"]
