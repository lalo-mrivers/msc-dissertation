["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"After reviewing the provided documents, I noticed that none of them directly mention the rotation speed of profile instruments. However, one document (Illusion of rotary motion reversal in a sphere is facilitated by increased rotational speed) discusses the effects of different rotational speeds on the illusion of rotary motion reversal. The study tested four rotational speeds: stationary, 1 rpm, 2.5 rpm, and 3.75 rpm. This suggests that profile instruments may not require high-speed rotation.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
