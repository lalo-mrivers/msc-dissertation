["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the function of filtration process while taking radiographs. We can find answers by analyzing relevant documents. In 'Evaluation of quality of lateral full spine radiographs', we see that the use of filtration produced the best overall film quality. This suggests that filtration has a positive effect on X-ray quality. Similarly, in 'Image enhancement by digital-analog filtration. I', the device for general image filtration records the processed image on film with increased perceptibility of large-scale objects and improved diagnostic ability. In 'Diagnostic significance of high-filtration xeromammography', we see that additional filtration enables significant reduction of radiation dose while maintaining diagnostic quality.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
