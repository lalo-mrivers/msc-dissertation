["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The zygomatic process of the maxilla is a bony prominence that plays a crucial role in facial skeleton formation. Reviewing the provided documents, we can identify the anatomical structures involved in zygoma-related procedures such as fractures and reduction techniques. The zygomatic arch is mentioned in several articles, including those discussing infracture technique for zygomatic body and arch reduction, and the zygomatico-temporal approach to the skull base. These procedures involve accessing the zygomatic bone through various incisions. From these references, we can conclude that the zygomatic process of the maxilla is connected to the zygomatic arch, which is in turn connected to other facial muscles.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
