["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the provided documents, we can see that hyperparathyroidism is characterized by an inverse significant correlation between TmP/GFR and i-PTH. This suggests that parathyroid hormone has a key role in regulating tubular handling of phosphate. We also know from the document 'Primary Hyperparathyroidism: Epidemiology, Diagnosis and Clinical Picture' that primary hyperparathyroidism is characterized by an inappropriate elevation of serum PTH relative to serum calcium value. Given this information, we can infer that hyperparathyroidism leads to decreased renal phosphate absorption.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
