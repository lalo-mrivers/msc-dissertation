["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is opening his eyes on verbal command, which suggests that he has an appropriate response to visual stimuli (E2). Additionally, he is moving all four limbs spontaneously, indicating a normal motor response (M5). Based on these findings, we can deduce that the patient's GCS score will be high. The GCS scale scores range from 3-15, with higher scores indicating better outcomes. Since the patient is opening his eyes and has normal motor function, his total GCS score will likely be between 13-15.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C: 11\"\n}"]
