["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the given documents, it is clear that periodontal disease involves an inflammatory response triggered by bacterial enzymes. In the first document, 'biological markers in periodontal disease', mediators of inflammation, catabolic enzymes, and enzymes associated with tissue necrosis were examined as potential factors for disease activity. One of these factors was tissue breakdown factors within the gingival sulcus which could be correlated with active stages of disease. The second document, 'The role of inflammatory mediators in the pathogenesis of periodontal disease', explains how bacterial substances activate host defense cells to produce and release mediators that stimulate the effectors of connective tissue breakdown. These cytokines manifest potent proinflammatory and catabolic activities, play key roles in periodontal tissue breakdown. Among these, one or several could be correlated with the active stages of disease. The third document, 'The microflora of periodontal sites showing active destructive progression', describes the composition of microbiological floras of all periodontitis samples which was statistically significantly different from that of subjects with healthy gingiva. The fourth document, 'Pathogenesis of inflammatory periodontal disease' explains how chronic periodontitis is caused by microbial origin and involves a classic acute exudative vasculitis in the initial lesion.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
