["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about hand to knee gait in polio. There is a relevant document about complete rotation of the leg with associated deformities in poliomyelitis. The document reports a 24-year-old man with a 180 degrees rotation deformity of the right leg, where the calf and heel are in front and the patella and toes are behind. This deformity was successfully corrected by arthrodesis of the knee without any neurovascular damage. There is no mention of hand involvement in this document. Therefore, we cannot determine which muscle is responsible for hand to knee gait in polio based on this document.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
