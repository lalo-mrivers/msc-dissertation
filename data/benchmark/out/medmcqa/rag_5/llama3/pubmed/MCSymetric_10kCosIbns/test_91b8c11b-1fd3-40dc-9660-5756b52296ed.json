["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking which statistical test is used for a particular purpose. The provided documents discuss various statistical tests, including Fisher's Exact Test and the independent samples t test. After reviewing these documents, we can conclude that the Statistical 'Q' test is not explicitly discussed in any of them. However, based on the context of 2 x 2 tables and small sample sizes, I'm going to focus on the text about applying Fisher's Exact Test when testing for statistical significance using small sample data presented in a 2 x 2 table. Since this test is used to determine statistical significance in 2 x 2 tables with independent samples, it seems unlikely that the Statistical 'Q' test would be used for outlier detection (option B), determining normality distribution (option C), or comparing more than two groups (option D). Therefore, I'm going to focus on option A: Comparing the proportion of means of 2 groups.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
