["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the modulus of elasticity of a cement for supporting complex amalgam restoration. The relevant document that discusses this is 'Effects of cement bases on the stresses in amalgam restorations'. It states that under the same load, the maximum tensile stresses and deflections in the amalgam restoration increased at least threefold with a zinc oxide-eugenol (ZOE) base as compared with a ZnPO4 cement base. This suggests that ZOE has a higher modulus of elasticity than ZnPO4. Among the given options, only A: ZOE matches this conclusion.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
