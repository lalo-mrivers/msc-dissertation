["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"There is no mention of RBCs (Red Blood Cells) in the provided documents. However, we can analyze the metabolic changes that occur during fasting. In [Effect of total fasting on serum protein concentrations (author's transl)], it is mentioned that haptoglobin, transferrin and beta1A-globin showed a marked decline during fasting. This suggests that there may be some changes in RBC metabolism or function during fasting. However, the specific fuel used by RBCs is not explicitly stated. In [Ultrastructural demonstration of rabbit heart myocyte metabolism during fasting], it is mentioned that cardiac myocytes accumulate lipids and glycogen during fasting, which could potentially affect RBC metabolism.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
