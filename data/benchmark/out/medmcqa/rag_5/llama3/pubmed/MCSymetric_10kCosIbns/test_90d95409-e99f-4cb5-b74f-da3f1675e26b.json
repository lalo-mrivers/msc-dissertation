["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about P-glycoprotein inducers. From the provided documents, it is mentioned that P-glycoprotein is responsible for expelling xenobiotics from the intracellular space and thus also for the development of MDR (Multidrug Resistance). In the study on P glycoprotein and multidrug resistance, it is stated that the expression of P-gp has been found in neoplastic and normal tissues. The aim of this study was to review the role of P-gp expression in laboratory and clinic. Furthermore, the document 'Rational design and pre-clinical pharmacology of drugs for reversing multidrug resistance' discusses how P-glycoprotein (P-gp), the membrane efflux pump responsible for MDR, should be valuable in the treatment of patients with drug-resistant cancer. According to this study, a class of drugs called phenothiazines can interfere with the action of P-gp, which is the membrane efflux pump responsible for MDR.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: Rifampicin\"\n}"]
