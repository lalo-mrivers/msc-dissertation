["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 6-month-old boy with recurrent vomiting and polyuria. His blood work shows normal creatinine levels but slightly elevated calcium levels. The daily urinary calcium excretion is reduced, which suggests that the patient may have absorptive hypercalciuria. Additionally, bilateral nephrocalcinosis on ultrasound abdomen supports this diagnosis. Given the patient's age and symptoms, a primary hyperparathyroidism is unlikely. Bartter syndrome could be considered but it would not explain the bilateral nephrocalcinosis. The calcium sensing receptor mutation is an unlikely cause of hypercalcemia in a 6-month-old boy. Pseudo-pseudohypoparathyroidism is also an unlikely diagnosis as it typically presents with hypocalcemia, not hypercalcemia.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
