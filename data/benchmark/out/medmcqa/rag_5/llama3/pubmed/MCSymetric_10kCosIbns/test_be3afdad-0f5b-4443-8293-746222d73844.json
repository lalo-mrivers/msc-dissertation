["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to the documents, fracture healing is a process that involves restoration of structural integrity. Mechanical discontinuity loss of force transmission, and pathological mobility of bone are the main issues addressed. The biomechanical aspects of fracture healing suggest that mechanical variables definitely alter qualitatively the healing of fractured bone. The recovery of rigidity and strength is related to tissue differentiation. This information suggests that compression may be one of the forces that can affect fracture healing.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
