["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The paper highlights the problem of misinterpretation of statistical significance after multiple comparisons. It emphasizes that researchers should avoid reporting statistical significance with *, **, or *** because it confuses statistical significance with clinical significance and wastes time, money, and energy. Therefore, I should look at the relevant documents to understand what p-values represent in each scenario. In this case, the p-value is 0.00. The paper does not provide specific information about what a p-value of 0.00 means in terms of the population or significance level. However, based on general statistical knowledge, I can infer that a p-value of 0.00 indicates strong evidence against the null hypothesis and suggests that the observed difference is statistically significant.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
