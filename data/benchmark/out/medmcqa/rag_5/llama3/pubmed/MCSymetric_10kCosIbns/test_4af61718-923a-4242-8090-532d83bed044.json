["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents describe the culture of pulp cells. In vitro culture of pulp cells mentions the migration and proliferation of fibroblast-like cells, but no mitotic activity of odontoblasts could be induced. Characteristics of human dental pulp cells in cell cultures discuss the generation time, division rate, and synchrony of growth process. Ultrastructural study of human pulp cells cultured in vitro describes the morphology of the cells, including the presence of a cilium, endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, and secretion granules. Establishment of primary cultures of pulp cells from bovine permanent incisors discusses the methods for separating pulp cells and culturing them. Regulatory factors in pulp biology: a reaction highlights various developmental processes related to the pulp. None of these documents mention totipotency or monopotency. Multipotent is mentioned in [In vitro culture of pulp cells], where it mentions migration and proliferation of fibroblast-like cells, which suggests that these cells can differentiate into different cell types. Polypotent is not a valid term in the context of stem cell biology. Therefore, based on the information provided, the correct answer is A: Multipotent.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
