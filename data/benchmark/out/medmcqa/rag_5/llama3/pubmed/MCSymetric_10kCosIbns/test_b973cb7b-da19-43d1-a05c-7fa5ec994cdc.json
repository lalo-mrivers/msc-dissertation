["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about yellowish-brown staining of IOPA dental X-ray film. The relevant documents are [An approach to removing stains and remineralization of dental fluorosis], [Comparative studies on panoramic radiographic (Panorex) and intra-oral radiographs], [Influence of scattered radiation and tube potential on radiographic contrast: comparison of two different dental X-ray films] and [Evaluation of extrinsic tooth discoloration]. None of the documents mention immersion in fixer without washing, increased temperature of developer or drying away of the developer solution. The documents only discuss about dental fluorosis, panoramic radiographs, radiographic contrast and extrinsic tooth discoloration. Therefore, it is not possible to find an answer in these documents that would explain yellowish-brown staining of IOPA dental X-ray film.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"Not applicable\"\n}"]
