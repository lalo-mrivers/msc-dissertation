["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about how iron enters the enterocyte. From the provided documents, we can see that studies on unidirectional uptake of iron across intestinal brush border suggest that iron absorption is by passive diffusion and does not contribute significantly to mucosal control of iron absorption. Additionally, alterations in mucosal processing of iron in response to very-short-term dietary iron depletion and repletion indicate that changes in the presence of an iron-binding protein composed of subunits of 52,000 Da are consistent with the changes observed in iron uptake by intact brush-border membrane vesicles. Therefore, it is likely that iron enters enterocyte through a mechanism involving passive diffusion and possibly an iron-binding protein.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
