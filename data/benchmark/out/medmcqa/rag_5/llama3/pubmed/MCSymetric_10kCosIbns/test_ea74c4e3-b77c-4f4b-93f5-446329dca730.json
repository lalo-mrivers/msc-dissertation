["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks which factor leads to an increase in enzyme activity. From the provided documents, it is known that enzymes that provide maximal rates of catalysis should be characterized by values of Ks, the dissociation constant of the enzyme-substrate complex, greater than 10 times the value of the ambient substrate concentration. This suggests that focus should be on the relative numerical values of k(cat), the rate constant for the enzyme-catalyzed reaction. The documents also suggest that enzymes with optimal catalytic activity have high values of k(cat). Therefore, an increase in enzyme activity would likely result from an increase in k(cat).\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
