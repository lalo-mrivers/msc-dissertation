["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the management of Intraocular Lens (IOL) placed in a young male. Since IOL is typically used to correct refractive errors after cataract surgery or as a part of refractive surgery, it's important to consider the expected outcomes and complications associated with IOL placement.\n\nAfter 10 years, posterior capsule opacification (PCO) may occur, which can affect visual acuity. In this case, IOL removal is not indicated because PCO is a common phenomenon that requires no intervention.\n\nThere is no strong evidence to support removing the IOL solely based on age or presbyopia, as this would not address any specific complication or concern.\n\nThe option D 'Should be changed after 10 year' is not relevant to the question as it implies replacing the IOL, which is not a standard practice unless there are specific indications such as PCO or complications.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
