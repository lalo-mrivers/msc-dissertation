["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks which of the given options is not an amino acid. From the provided documents, we can see that the documents are related to amino acids and their properties. Amino acids are divided into families according to genetic code algorithm, and there is a recommended method for the analysis of amino acids in biological materials. We also have information about correlation analysis of amino acid usage in protein classes and distribution of identical amino acid residues in the primary structure of proteins. From this information, we can conclude that glycine, glutamic acid, and hydroxy proline are all amino acids. Choline is not mentioned as an amino acid in any of the provided documents.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
