["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about which hormone(s) is/are under inhibitory control of hypothalamus. The relevant documents mention the somatotropic function of the hypophysis and its relationship with various endocrine diseases, as well as the mechanism of action of neurohypophyseal hormones on sodium excretion and diuresis. There is no direct information about prolactin or growth hormone being under inhibitory control of hypothalamus in these documents. However, we can infer that the somatotropic function of the hypophysis is influenced by the hypothalamo-hypophysial interrelations, as mentioned in [Somatotropic function of the hypophysis in endocrine diseases]. This suggests that the growth hormone may be under some level of control from the hypothalamus. No information is provided about prolactin being under inhibitory control of hypothalamus.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: Both Prolactin and Growth hormone\""]
