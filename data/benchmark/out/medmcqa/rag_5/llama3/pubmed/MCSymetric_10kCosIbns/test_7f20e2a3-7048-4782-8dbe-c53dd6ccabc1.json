["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the most effective method of reducing patient somatic exposure when taking a radiograph. The provided documents discuss variations in x-ray exposures to patients, radiation exposure of operators during angiography, and recent data on radiation exposure to patients in diagnostic radiology. Based on these documents, it can be inferred that the key factors contributing to large differences in exposure are fluoroscopic exposure rate, time, kVp, filtration, choice of screen-film combination, and attenuation of table tops and phototimers. Therefore, the most effective method of reducing patient somatic exposure would be to adjust these factors.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
