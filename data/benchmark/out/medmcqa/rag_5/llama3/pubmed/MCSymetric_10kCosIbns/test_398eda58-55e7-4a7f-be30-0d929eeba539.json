["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about coarse tremors of the tongue. According to the document 'Semiaiology of Tremors', there are two main types of tremor: postural and tremor of attitude. Both occur while the limb remains immobile, whether by wilful design or when at rest in a position of posture and subject only to the action of gravity. During voluntary movement, tremor is not present. Irregular, asymmetrical and non-rhythmic oscillations may appear however - as in so-called intention tremor, of cerebellar origin - but this abnormal movement can hardly be called a real tremor. It is merely a manifestation of ataxia.\n\nThe document 'Physiological and pharmacological aids in the differential diagnosis of tremor' mentions EMG patterns during voluntary activity for essential tremor (5-8 Hz bursts of activity which are synchronous in antagonistic muscles) and Parkinson's disease (3-7 Hz activity which alternates between antagonistic muscles). This information can be used to eliminate options.\n\nCoarse tremors of the tongue are not mentioned as a characteristic of any of the three main types of tremor. However, intention tremor is characterized by irregular, asymmetrical and non-rhythmic oscillations, which may appear during voluntary movement. Therefore, it's likely that the coarse tremors of the tongue refer to intention tremor.\n\nAccording to 'The shaking patient', intention tremor occurs with movement and is characteristic of cerebellar disease. This information suggests that the coarse tremors of the tongue are not seen in Parkinsonism, as they would be expected to respond to treatment with L-dopa if they were associated with Parkinson's disease.\n\nIn conclusion, the coarse tremors of the tongue are not seen in Parkinsonism.\", \n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
