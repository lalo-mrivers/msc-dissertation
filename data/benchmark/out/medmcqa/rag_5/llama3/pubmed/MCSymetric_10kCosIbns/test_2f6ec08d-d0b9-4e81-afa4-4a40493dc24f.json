["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the characteristics of composite resins and their fillers. The size of the filler particles is mentioned as a factor that can affect the wear of composites. The document 'Surface roughness of composite filling materials' states that increased filler particle size results in improved polishability, which also leads to improved wear resistance. This suggests that increasing the size of filler particles may have a positive effect on the properties of the composite.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
