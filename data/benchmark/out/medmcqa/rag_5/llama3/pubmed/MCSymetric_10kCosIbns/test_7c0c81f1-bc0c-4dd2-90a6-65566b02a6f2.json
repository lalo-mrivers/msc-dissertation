["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the cells that have the greatest affinity to bisphosphonates. After reviewing the provided documents, I noticed that the effects of mono- and bisphosphonates on enamel mineralization were studied in the developing rat molar. Additionally, the metabolism of halogenated bisphosphonates was investigated in the cellular slime mould Dictyostelium discoideum.\n\nI did not find any information about the affinity of bisphosphonates to specific cell types such as osteoprogenitor cells, osteoblasts, osteoclasts or osteocytes. However, I can conclude that the primary effect of bisphosphonates is on dental mineralization and bone metabolism. Therefore, it is likely that cells involved in these processes have a high affinity to bisphosphonates.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
