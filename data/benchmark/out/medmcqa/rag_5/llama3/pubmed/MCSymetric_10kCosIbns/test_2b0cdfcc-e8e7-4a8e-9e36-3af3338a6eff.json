["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the characteristics of pulp proper. From the provided documents, we can infer that pulp proper is a small tissue with limited information available about its symptomology and histopathological data. However, one of the papers describes the healing process after pulp exposure and capping with Ca(OH)2 cement. It mentions that during the second week of healing, differentiation of cells occurred at the wound surface, which had the characteristic features of odontoblasts. This suggests that multipotent cells may be present in pulp proper. Additionally, another paper describes the properties of inorganic pyrophosphatase in rabbit dental pulp and its distribution in the supernatant fraction. No information is provided about loose connective tissue or fine nerve fibers and blood vessels being part of pulp proper. Therefore, it is likely that pulp proper resembles multipotent cells.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
