["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To find the number of pregnant women registered in the sub-center, we need to calculate the crude birth rate. Crude birth rate is defined as the number of live births per 1,000 population per year. Given that the crude birth rate for the sub-center is 20, it means that there are 20 live births per 1,000 population per year. Since we don't have the total population data, let's assume it's 10,000 (a common assumption in many studies). To find the number of pregnant women registered in the sub-center, we can calculate the total number of live births per year by multiplying the crude birth rate with the population: 20 x 10,000 = 200,000. Since each pregnancy results in one live birth, the number of pregnant women registered in the sub-center is also 200,000.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
