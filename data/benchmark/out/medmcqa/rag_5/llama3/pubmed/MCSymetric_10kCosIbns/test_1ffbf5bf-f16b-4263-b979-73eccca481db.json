["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents provide information about the mandibular canal and root canals of various teeth. The question asks about the incidence of 2 canals in mandibular incisors. Since there is no specific information provided about mandibular incisors, we need to rely on general information about the root canal configuration of mandibular premolars. According to the 'Root canal configuration of the mandibular first premolar' document, 24% of the premolars contained Type IV canals. The same document also mentions that C-shaped canals were associated predominantly with Type IV canal systems and occurred in 14% of the roots. Since incisors are different from premolars, we cannot directly apply these findings to mandibular incisors. However, we can make an educated estimate based on the general trend.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
