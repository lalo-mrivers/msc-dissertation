["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the growth of Streptococcus mutans on different media. One document mentions that blood-sucrose media consistently produced the highest recoveries, while another document discusses a chemically defined medium in which several cariogenic strains of oral streptococci grew rapidly. None of these documents mention Mac conkey medium or nutrient agar as selective media for S. mutans. The documents do mention tellurite medium, specifically MST with 40% sucrose (MS40S) and MS with 1% tellurite (MST), which were the most inhibitory for all serotypes of S. mutans. This suggests that tellurite medium is a potential selective medium for S. mutans. The only remaining option is mitis salivarius agar, which was specifically mentioned as one of the media that produced high recoveries of S. mutans. However, it was also noted that MST with 40% sucrose (MS40S) and MS with 1% tellurite (MST) were more inhibitory than mitis salivarius agar.\", \"answer_choice\": B}"]
