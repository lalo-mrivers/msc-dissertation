["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents discuss the influence of the soft palate on mandibular growth, anatomical findings in cleft palate patients, prosthetic reconstruction following resection of the hard and soft palate, a new method for the closure of a cleft palate, and dermatoglyphic analysis of primary and secondary cleft palate patients. The question asks what is not seen when the soft palate is paralysed. Since the documents do not directly address this specific scenario, we need to look at the functions of the soft palate muscles. One of the papers mentions that the soft palate has a major influence on mandibulo-lingual statics and can be associated with glossoptosis with mandibular retrognathia or functional mandibular prognathia. This suggests that the soft palate plays an important role in maintaining proper oral and nasal cavity relationships. When paralysed, this function would likely be impaired. The option B: Nasal regurgitation is not seen because it implies a failure to prevent food from entering the nasal cavity, which would likely occur due to the impairment of the soft palate's function when paralysed.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
