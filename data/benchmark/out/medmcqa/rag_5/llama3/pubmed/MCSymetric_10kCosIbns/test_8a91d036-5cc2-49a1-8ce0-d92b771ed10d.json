["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the nerve fibers that are stimulated to detect pain. In the first document, it's mentioned that some units responded to heating but not to cooling, and others responded to cooling but not to heating. This suggests that there may be different types of nerve fibers involved in detecting thermal stimuli. The second document mentions pulpal receptors and notes that stimulation of the pulp with insulated, embedded, dental electrodes does not excite receptors in adjacent, nondental tissue. This implies that the stimulation is specific to the tooth pulp. The third document discusses cerebral responses to electrical tooth pulp stimulation in man and notes that tooth pulp-evoked potentials represent objective, quantifiable, nonverbal concomitants of central events associated with the perception of noxious stimuli. Finally, the fourth document describes a study on simple non-invasive mapping of pain pathways in living humans and mentions the use of different neurotransmitters such as substance P, oncogen C-fos Ab1, oncogen C-fos Ab2, dopamine, and acetylcholine.\n\nConsidering these documents, it seems that A delta nerve fibers are involved in detecting pain. This is because some units responded to heating but not to cooling, and others responded to cooling but not to heating, which suggests different types of nerve fibers involved in detecting thermal stimuli. Additionally, the stimulation of the pulp with insulated, embedded, dental electrodes does not excite receptors in adjacent, nondental tissue, implying that the stimulation is specific to the tooth pulp.\n\nTherefore, based on these documents and considering the step-by-step thinking, it can be concluded that A delta nerve fibers are stimulated to detect pain.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
