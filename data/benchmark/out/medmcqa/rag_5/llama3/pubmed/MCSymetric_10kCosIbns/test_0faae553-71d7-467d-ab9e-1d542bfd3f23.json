["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the AO system of fixation when adequate bone buttressing is present. The relevant documents mention various internal fixations methods such as plates, nails, screws and encircling wires. However, they do not directly address the AO system. Therefore, we need to look for any mentions of the AO system or compression osteogenesis which is a technique used by the AO system.\n\nFrom the document [An experimental study on various internal fixations in fracture of a long bone (author's transl)], it is mentioned that there has been a tendency to use larger materials for internal fixations such as an AO compression plate. This suggests that the AO system may be associated with compression osteogenesis, which is the process of new bone formation under compressive stress.\n\nHowever, this association is not explicitly stated in any of the provided documents. Therefore, we need to make an educated guess based on our understanding of the AO system and compression osteogenesis.\n\nFrom a biomechanical perspective, the AO system is designed to provide stable fixation while allowing for some degree of movement and stress redistribution at the bone-implant interface. This would promote the formation of new bone through compression osteogenesis.\n\nTherefore, based on our analysis, we can infer that the AO system may be associated with compression osteogenesis when adequate bone buttressing is present.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
