["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the type of strain that develops when a force is applied perpendicular to the surface. The relevant document is [Measurement of forces in highly elastic regulating rings]. According to this document, the platform shows a rectilinear response for static forces up to 500 kp with a stable zero value. This means that the force is applied normally to the surface. The document also mentions that calibration of dynamic forces was carried out by calculation of the forces during a vertical jump compared with what would be expected from the time of flight. This suggests that the force is still being applied perpendicular to the surface.\n\nFurthermore, [Normal contact of elastic spheres with two elastic layers as a model of joint articulation] discusses the stresses and displacements in the layered region of contact, including normal compressive stresses. Similarly, [Surface strain distribution in isolated single lumbar vertebrae] examines the surface strains of isolated single lumbar vertebrae under compressive load, which suggests that the force is being applied normally to the surface.\n\nIn contrast, [The distribution of material density and mechanical stress in the human radius during bending (author's transl)] discusses loads applied to 78 human radii and calculates torque and bending stresses, but this does not provide information about normal or perpendicular forces.\n\nTherefore, based on these documents, it can be concluded that when a force is applied perpendicular to the surface, compressive strain develops.\",\n\"answer_choice\": A"]
