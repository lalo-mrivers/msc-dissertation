["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the retainer of choice for a posterior abutment with acceptable crown root ratios, average crown length, normal esthetic requirement. The relevant information is from 'Selection of retainers in lower overlay denture-in relation to the abutment tooth mobility--(a laboratory study)'. This study shows that when a force is applied directly to the abutment, the tooth mobility (lateral excursion) is markedly reduced according to the favorable ratio of the clinical crown to the root length. Splinting by the bar is effective to reduce the lateral excursion. Therefore, the retainer type that shows the least value of lateral excursion is the most suitable for this case.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: PFM\""]
