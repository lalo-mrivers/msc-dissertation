["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the angle between the rake face and radial line. The documents provided seem to be unrelated to this specific topic. However, I can see that one of the documents (Three versus four radial keratotomy incisions) mentions radial keratotomy (RK), which might be relevant.
