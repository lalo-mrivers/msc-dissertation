["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the accurate sample size for this study, we need to use the methods outlined in 'Determination of significant relative risks and optimal sampling procedures in prospective and retrospective comparative studies of various sizes.' This paper provides formulas for determining the required sample size based on the desired level of precision, power, and alpha error.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the required sample size (n) using the formula: n = (Z^2 * P * (1-P)) / E^2, where Z is the Z-score corresponding to the desired level of significance (5%), P is the prevalence of the disease (10%), and E is the desired level of precision (20%).\n\nPlugging in these values, we get: n = (1.96^2 * 0.1 * (1-0.1)) / 0.2^2 = 361.\n\nSince the power of the study needs to be at least 20%, we also need to ensure that the required sample size is sufficient to achieve this power. According to 'Determination of significant relative risks and optimal sampling procedures in prospective and retrospective comparative studies of various sizes,' the required sample size can be calculated using the formula: n = (Z^2 * P * (1-P)) / E^2 * (1 / (P * (1-P))) * 4, where Z is again the Z-score corresponding to the desired level of significance.\n\nPlugging in these values, we get: n = (1.96^2 * 0.1 * (1-0.1)) / 0.2^2 * (1 / (0.1 * (1-0.1))) * 4 = 3600.\n\nTherefore, the accurate sample size for this study is approximately 3600.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
