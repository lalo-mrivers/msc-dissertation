["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about what to do if continuous hypersensitivity develops in a recently restored tooth. The relevant information from the provided documents is that root hypersensitivity is discussed in [Possibilities of reducing the sensitivity of the neck of the tooth], where the authors review different fluoride compounds, strontium chloride, and potassium nitrate as potential treatments. In [Acute and chronic toothache], it is mentioned that chronic dental pain can be caused by inflammatory reactions. Since continuous hypersensitivity develops in a recently restored tooth, it seems likely that the sensitivity is related to pulp or dentine inflammation.\n\nThe most promising treatment options based on this information would be those that address pulp or dentine inflammation. This points towards performing pulpectomy (C) as the first step to treat the sensitivity.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
