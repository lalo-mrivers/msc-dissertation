["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about managing a female with suspected child abuse who has severe bleeding from the perineum. The documents provided discuss rape victims, but they also mention acute genital injury in prepubertal girls, which could be relevant to this scenario. We need to think about what would be the most appropriate first line of management given the severity of the bleeding. It's not clear if the patient is still a victim of child abuse or if the bleeding has occurred due to some other reason. However, we know that the documents suggest that in cases of acute genital injury in prepubertal girls, penetrating injuries can be particularly dangerous.

This would involve checking the airway and ensuring that the patient is breathing properly.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
