["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents discuss the properties of different buffer systems, including HCO3/H2CO3. The question asks about why HCO3/H2CO3 is the best buffer. From the provided texts, we can infer that HCO3/H2CO3 has a pKa near physiological pH (pH 7.3-8.8) and its components can be increased or decreased in the body as needed. Additionally, HCO3/H2CO3 acts as a good acceptor and donor of H+ ions. Therefore, option D: Combination of a weak acid and weak base is the best answer.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
