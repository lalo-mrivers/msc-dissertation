["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Since the documents provide information about different types of heart diseases during pregnancy, I will look for specific mentions of maternal mortality rates for each condition. Upon reviewing the documents, I found that there is no mention of maternal mortality rates specifically for Coarctation of aorta or Eisenmenger syndrome.\n\nHowever, in the document [Incidence of heart disease in pregnancy], it is mentioned that 'cardiac disease was found to be the most important non-obstetric cause of maternal death.' This suggests that cardiac diseases in general may have higher maternal mortality rates during pregnancy. But this does not provide specific information about which type of heart disease has the highest maternal mortality rate.\n\nIn [Obstetric care in cardiopathic pregnant women], it is mentioned that 'heart diseases in pregnancy represent the main non-obstetrical cause of death.' Again, this suggests that cardiac diseases may have higher maternal mortality rates during pregnancy. However, no specific information about which type of heart disease has the highest maternal mortality rate is provided.\n\nIn [Characteristics of pregnancy and delivery in women with heart diseases], it is mentioned that 'the maternal mortality rate was not significantly higher than that in the total population.' This does not provide any information about which type of heart disease has the highest maternal mortality rate during pregnancy.\n\nFinally, I looked at [Gestation in patients with heart disease] for any specific information about maternal mortality rates. However, no such information is provided in this document either.\n\nAfter reviewing all the documents, it appears that there is no specific information available about which type of heart disease has the highest maternal mortality rate during pregnancy. The closest information available suggests that cardiac diseases in general may have higher maternal mortality rates during pregnancy. Therefore, I will choose an answer based on the information provided.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: MS\"\n}"]
