["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks to identify the most probable diagnosis based on lab findings for a 25-year-old lady with rheumatoid arthritis. The patient has anemia (Hb-9gm/dl) and hypochromic anemia is often associated with rheumatoid arthritis. MCV of 55fl suggests a mild normocytic anemia which correlates with the erythrocyte sedimentation rate and with activity of the disease. Serum iron of 30microgm/d1, ferritin of 200 ng/ml, and TIBC of 298 micrograms/dl suggest that anemia is not due to iron deficiency. Considering these findings, the most probable diagnosis is C: Anemia of chronic disease.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"]
