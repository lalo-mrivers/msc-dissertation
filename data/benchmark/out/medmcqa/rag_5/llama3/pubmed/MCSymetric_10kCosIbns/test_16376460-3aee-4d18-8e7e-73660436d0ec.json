["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the width of connective tissue around an implant. None of the provided documents explicitly mention the width of connective tissue around a specific type of implant. However, [Studies on the halfside comparison of heterotopic transplantation of mucosa with and without epithelium] discusses the reduction in width of attached gingiva after six months for both connective tissue transplants (36%) and epithelium-containing transplants (15%). This study suggests that connective tissue transplant width can decrease over time. In [Mechanical properties and hydroxyproline content of connective tissue in porous ceramic implants], the model applies to study connective tissue regeneration, but it does not provide specific information on the width of connective tissue around an implant.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
