["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to the documents, staphylococci often produce penicillinase which inactivates penicillin. Therefore, penicillin G is not a good choice for treatment of infection involving non-penicillinase producing staphylococcus. The document 'Alexander Fleming: the spectrum of penicillin' also mentions that the development of penicillinase-resistant agents has countered the ability of staphylococci to produce this enzyme. This suggests that penicillinase-resistant penicillins, such as cloxacillin, should be used instead. The document 'Resistance of staphylococci to penicillin-G and cloxacillin' also supports this conclusion, stating that over 99% of the isolated Staphylococci were sensitive to cloxacillin.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
