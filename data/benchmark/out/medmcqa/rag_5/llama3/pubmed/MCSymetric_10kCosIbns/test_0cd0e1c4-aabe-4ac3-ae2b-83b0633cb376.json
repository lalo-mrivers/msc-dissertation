["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The provided documents suggest that fat consumption is inversely related to blood lipids. In the [Fat consumption, blood lipids and age] document, it is mentioned that obese subjects had lower consumption of total fat in food compared to normal-weight subjects. Similarly, in the [Weight and metabolic changes induced by low carbohydrate-high fat diets in man and in rat] study, an increase in serum cholesterol level was observed when a high-fat diet was consumed.\n\nIn the given scenario, where the person is on a fat-free, carbohydrate-rich diet, it can be inferred that their total fat consumption is zero or very low. This could lead to an increase in blood lipids, particularly those related to carbohydrates.\n\nThe [Effect of a reduced diet on hyperlipoproteinemia in metabolic-alimentary obesity] document mentions that most patients examined demonstrated hyperlipoproteinemia, basically of the IIb type. The study suggests that following a course of the reduced diet, the frequency of hyperlipoproteinemia of the II, III and IV types declines.\n\nIn this context, it is likely that VLDL (very low-density lipoprotein) will be elevated in his blood, as it is related to carbohydrate metabolism and is often increased in cases of obesity.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
