["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the characteristics of a youthful feminine smile. The provided documents discuss various aspects of the face and smile, including anatomy, facial expression, and rhinoplasty. Based on these documents, we can identify the key features of a youthful feminine smile. The smile should have proper exposure of the red zone of the lips, an undistorted philtrum, and undisturbed nasolabial grooves (as mentioned in 'The anatomy of a smile'). Additionally, the smile should follow the golden proportion (as discussed in 'Rhinoplasty and facial expression'), which suggests that the ratio of the width of the smile to the length of the upper lip is approximately 1.6:1.\n\nNow, let's analyze each option:\n\nA: Golden proportion is followed - This is a characteristic of a youthful feminine smile, as mentioned earlier.\nB: Closure of incisor embrasure - This does not seem to be directly related to the characteristics of a youthful feminine smile.\nC: Rounding of incisal line angles - This could be a characteristic of an aging smile, rather than a youthful one. The document 'Surgical treatment of forehead and glabellar wrinkles' discusses the importance of maintaining the natural facial shape and avoiding unnatural shapes that can create an older appearance.\nD: Softened facial line angles - This is also not directly related to the characteristics of a youthful feminine smile.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer is B: Closure of incisor embrasure.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
