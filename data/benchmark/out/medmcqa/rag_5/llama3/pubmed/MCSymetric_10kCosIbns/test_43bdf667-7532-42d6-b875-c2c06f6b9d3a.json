["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about splinting of cervical root fracture. The relevant documents mention fractures at the C3-C7 level presenting primarily diagnostic problems. If instability is certain, therapy is simple: using an image intensifier, dislocation is reduced under general anesthesia and relaxation, and later secured by anterior interbody fusion.
