["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the location where a bacteriocidal toxin is found. From the provided documents, we can see that cholera toxin is mentioned as a microbial toxin produced by Escherichia coli. However, there is no mention of a specific toxin being 'bacteriocidal'. Therefore, we need to look for other clues in the documents. Upon reviewing the text again, we notice that the document 'Structure, function, and antigenicity of cholera toxin' mentions that 'Cholera toxin activates plasma membrane adenylate cyclase in all mammalian cell types.' This suggests that the toxin has a broader effect on cells rather than just being bacteriocidal. However, this information does not directly answer the question. Finally, we need to look at other relevant documents, and from the document 'Purification of bacterial exotoxins' we can see that 'Bacterial protein toxins and their fragments have been isolated and purified for various reasons...' which implies that these toxins are related to bacteria, but this information does not directly answer the question either. Therefore, we need to rely on our knowledge of microbiology and biology in general.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
