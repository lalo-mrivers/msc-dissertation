["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe unstable angina as a clinical situation intermediate in severity between chronic effort angina and myocardial infarction. The documents also discuss the different subgroups of patients with variable severity, including those with known chronic angina and sudden or accelerated progression of symptoms, those with chronic angina and onset of recurrent attacks at rest, and those with angina of recent onset and rapid progression into a severe condition. The definition of unstable angina is proposed to be divided into two main clinical categories: Type I, which includes three subgroups, and Type II, which refers to severe unstable angina. Therefore, it can be inferred that the characteristics of unstable angina include chest pain occurring at rest, pain lasting for a certain period of time (although the exact duration is not specified), and pain subsiding on rest.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: All of the above.\""]
