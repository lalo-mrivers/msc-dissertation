["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks which amino acid is quickly converted to tyrosine. From the provided documents, we can see that Tyrosine aminotransferase is present in skin homogenate of AKR/J albino and C57BL/6J black mice, and it catalyzes the conversion of tyrosine to p-hydroxyphenylpyruvate. This suggests that there is an enzyme involved in converting another amino acid into tyrosine. From the other documents, we can see that phenylalanine is the precursor for tyrosine synthesis.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
