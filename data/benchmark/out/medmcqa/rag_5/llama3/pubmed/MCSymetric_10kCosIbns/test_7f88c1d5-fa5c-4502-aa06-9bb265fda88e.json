["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the cause of facial nerve injury during forceps delivery. The documents provided describe various complications of forceps delivery, including cranial nerve palsies. The sixth, ninth, and tenth cranial nerves are mentioned as being vulnerable to stretching and temporary paralysis due to rapid application of halo-pelvic traction. No mention is made of the facial nerve specifically. However, the document about contralateral occipital depression related to obstetric forceps injury does discuss the possibility of posterior skull depressions 180 degrees from the affected cornea, which correlates with the opposite blade of the forceps. This suggests that forceps pressure can cause injuries on both sides of the body. Given this information, it is unlikely that facial nerve injury during forceps delivery is due to the absence of the mastoid process at birth or the parotid gland being in a developing stage, as these are not related to forceps delivery. Sublingual hematoma during delivery causing neuropraxia seems more plausible, but it is not directly mentioned in any of the provided documents.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
