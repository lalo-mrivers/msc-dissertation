["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe various electromyographic (EMG) responses to different stimuli. The palmo-mental reflex is present in healthy subjects and those with limited cerebral lesions, while the planto-mental reflex is absent in healthy subjects but present in some cases of focal brain injury or diffuse lesions. The EMG response to mandibular notch stimulation shows an early response with a 2 ms latency and a late response with a 6 ms latency. No responses are induced in the contralateral masseter and temporal muscles. This information suggests that the lip and mentalis muscle contraction is not seen in...\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
