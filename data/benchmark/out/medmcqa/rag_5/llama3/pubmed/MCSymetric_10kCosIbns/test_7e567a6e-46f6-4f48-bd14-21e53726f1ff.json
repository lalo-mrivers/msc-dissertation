["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about replacing amino acids. From the provided documents, we can see that amino acid analogues were examined for their ability to inhibit the aminoacylation of tRNA in an Escherichia coli and rat liver system. Although some analogues behaved similarly in both systems, others like tryptophan's analogues behaved differently. This suggests that the structural requirements of the side chain are not comparable between the two systems. The documents also mention that the inhibition of growth of Escherichia coli 9723 by amino acid analogues can be prevented by adding methionine and phenylalanine respectively. Therefore, it is possible to suggest that replacing certain amino acids with their analogues may affect their functions.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
