["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the drainage of the frontal paranasal sinus. From the provided documents, we can see that the paranasal sinuses begin their development during the 3rd and 4th fetal months and undergo major expansion after birth. The maxillary sinus is mentioned to be of appreciable size in newborns and children. In the CT study, the results show that inflammatory changes are evident in 57 scans in the maxillary sinus, while in 24 studies, one sinus location was involved, including the maxillary sinus. From this information, we can infer that the frontal paranasal sinus is likely to drain into the middle meatus, which is a common drainage pathway for the maxillary sinus.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
