["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents provided are about brain anatomy and function. The question asks about unpaired structures in the brain. I will focus on the brain maps and anatomical descriptions to answer this question. The isocortex of the ox (Bos taurus) mentions different cortical types, but it does not provide information about unpaired structures. Functional relationships between the hippocampus and the cerebellum: an electrophysiological study of the cat provides details on neural connections, but it does not mention unpaired structures.
