["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents describe various aspects of glucose absorption in the intestine. From the information provided, it can be inferred that glucose transport across the mucosa of the small intestine is through simple diffusion, as mentioned in [Glucose transport across the mucosa of the small intestine]. The pH dependence and the fact that the rate of absorption remains constant for 1 hour after a sugar load also support this notion. Additionally, the study on intestinal handling of glucose gavage by the rat mentions that oxidation to 14CO2 accounted for 12-15% of the absorbed glucose, which is consistent with simple diffusion.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
