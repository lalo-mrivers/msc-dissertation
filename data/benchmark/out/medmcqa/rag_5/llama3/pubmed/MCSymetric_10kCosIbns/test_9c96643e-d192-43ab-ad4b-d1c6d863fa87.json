["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks what precipitation methods are not used for proteins. We can see from the given documents that KCl precipitation is used to concentrate sodium dodecyl sulfate-solubilized proteins from nanomolar solutions, and also phosphotungstic acid (PTA) precipitation procedure is mentioned for allergenic extracts. This information suggests that adding trichloroacetic acid, acetyl alcohol and acetone are not typical methods used in protein precipitation. Adjusting pH to other than the isoelectric point is a method used in some purification processes but it's not directly related to precipitation. Salts of heavy metals could be used for precipitation, but it's not clearly stated that this method is commonly used for proteins. Therefore, we can conclude that adding trichloroacetic acid and acetyl alcohol and acetone are the most likely answers.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
