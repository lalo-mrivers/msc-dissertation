["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, neurocysticercosis has different stages. The vesicular stage is characterized by active intraparenchymatous cysts with clinical features such as epilepsy and ataxia. The nodular calcified stage is marked by non-active parenchymatous calcifications without any symptoms in some cases. There is no mention of edema in the nodular calcified stage.

This information is not explicitly stated in the documents but can be logically deduced.\", \"answer_choice\": D}"]
