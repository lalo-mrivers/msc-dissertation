["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about embalming without issuing a death certificate being punishable under section. The relevant documents mention issues related to unnatural death, medical malpractice, and the moment of death. Looking at the options provided, they seem to be related to Indian Penal Code (IPC). The document [Malpractice--unnatural death. Medico-legal problems in the diagnostic activity of pathologists (author's transl)] does not provide direct information about punishable sections under IPC. However, it mentions compulsory notification of signs of unnatural death. Therefore, it seems that the issue is related to unnatural death rather than embalming.\n\nThe document [Medical and legal problems of multiple death certificates] provides more relevant information. It states that in cases of unnatural death and unclear manner of death, the police has to inform the prosecution. This implies that there are specific procedures for handling such cases. Embalming without issuing a death certificate is not mentioned explicitly but it seems that the issue may be related to the procedure of certifying unnatural death.\n\nThe document [Death and the moment of death: several legal aspects] does not provide direct information about embalming or punishable sections under IPC.\n\nFinally, the document [Inquests into London and Middlesex homicides, 1673-1782] provides historical information about coroner's inquests but it does not provide relevant information for this question.\n\nThe document [The case for a statutory 'definition of death'] discusses legal issues related to the moment of death, re-animation procedures, and the right to die. However, it does not provide direct information about embalming or punishable sections under IPC.\n\nConsidering all the documents provided, I conclude that the answer must be B: IPC 297 as it is the only option related to embalming without issuing a death certificate being punishable under section.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
