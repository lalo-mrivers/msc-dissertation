["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided table, we can observe that the new drug treated group shows an increase in heart rate, systolic blood pressure, and diastolic blood pressure compared to the placebo-treated group. Additionally, tremors are present in the new drug treated group but absent in the placebo-treated group.\\n\\nConsidering these changes, it is likely that the new drug has a stimulatory effect on the autonomic nervous system, possibly acting on adrenergic receptors.\\n\\nGiven the increase in blood pressure and heart rate, as well as the presence of tremors, I would expect the new drug to have an effect on both alpha-1 and beta-adrenergic receptors.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
