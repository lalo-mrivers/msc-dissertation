["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the treatment of a fractured maxillary central incisor with no response from the pulp, but no periapical lesion. This suggests that the injury was likely an avulsion or luxation injury, rather than a crack in the tooth. The goal is to preserve the tooth and prevent further complications. Considering the age of the child (8 years old) and the fact that 10 months have passed since the injury, it's likely that the pulp has necrosed and the treatment should focus on preserving the root and preventing further complications.\n\nGiven these factors, the most conservative approach would be to choose D: Complete debridement and apexification. This procedure would help to prevent infection and abscess formation while allowing the tooth to remain in place.\n\nAdditionally, considering that there is no periapical lesion, it's unlikely that a pulp capping or pulpotomy would be necessary.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
