["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the primary effect of tongue movement. The documents provided are related to tongue movements and articulation. One document discusses electromyographic tracings from four muscles - genioglossus (GG), anterior belly of the digastric (D) sternothyroid (ST) and thyrohyoid (TH). Another document describes a tongue motility test that examines the resting position and mobility of the tongue in relation to 9 different movement patterns. The third document uses X-ray motion pictures and electromyography to record tongue movement and muscle activity during /s/ production. Finally, the last document discusses lingualpalatal contact patterns using electropalatography (EPG). Based on these documents, it is clear that tongue movement has its primary effect on articulation, specifically in shaping sounds such as vowels and consonants.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
