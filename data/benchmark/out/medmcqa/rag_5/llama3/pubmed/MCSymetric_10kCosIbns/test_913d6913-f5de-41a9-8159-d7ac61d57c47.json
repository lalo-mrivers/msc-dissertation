["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has a positive test for Anti-HCMV antibodies at birth. This suggests that the child has congenital CMV infection. In the provided studies, congenitally infected children were found to have more severe and complex sequelae compared to those with postnatally acquired infection. The most common sequelae in congenitally infected children include microcephaly, sensorineural hearing loss, quadriplegia, mental retardation, ventricular septal defect, and tooth defects.
