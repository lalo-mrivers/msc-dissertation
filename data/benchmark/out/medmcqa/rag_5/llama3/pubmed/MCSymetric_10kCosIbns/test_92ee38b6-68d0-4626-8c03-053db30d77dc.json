From the studies, it is evident that the most frequent causes of sudden death are rupture of the myocardium (28.8%), primary ventricular fibrillation (22.0%), and thromboembolic phenomena (17.8%). Additionally, other documents suggest that cardiac rupture accounts for 29% of cases, while arrhythmias account for 2.72%. Finally, some studies indicate that ventricular fibrillation is a risk factor for late in-hospital sudden death. Considering these findings, the most common cause of sudden death in patients with acute myocardial infarction is likely to be one of the three causes mentioned.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
