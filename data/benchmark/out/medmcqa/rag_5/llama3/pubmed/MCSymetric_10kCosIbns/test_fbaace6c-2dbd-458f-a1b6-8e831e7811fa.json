["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about vasomotor reversal of Dale. The relevant document for this question is 'Evaluation of autonomic function'. In this document, it talks about the Valsalva maneuver and its effects on the body. Vasomotor reversal of Dale refers to a response where after an initial vasoconstriction, there is a subsequent vasodilation. This is seen in some patients with postural hypotension after the Valsalva maneuver. However, this document does not specifically mention any medication or drug administration that would cause vasomotor reversal of Dale. Therefore, we cannot find a direct answer to this question from these documents.\n\nHowever, if we look at other relevant information, such as 'VOJTA neurophysiologic therapy', it talks about reflexlocomotion and automatic control of posture, which does not seem directly related to vasomotor reversal of Dale. Similarly, 'Todd's paralysis' is a cerebrovascular phenomenon that also does not seem directly related to the question.\n\nThe only remaining document is 'Vasomotor responses to the Valsalva manoeuvre in normal subjects and in patients with diabetes mellitus'. This document talks about the effects of the Valsalva maneuver on different patients, including those with postural hypotension. It does not mention vasomotor reversal of Dale or any specific medication administration that would cause it.\n\nTherefore, based on this information, we cannot find a direct answer to this question from these documents and none of the options seem directly related to vasomotor reversal of Dale.\", \"answer_choice\": \"None of the above\"}"]
