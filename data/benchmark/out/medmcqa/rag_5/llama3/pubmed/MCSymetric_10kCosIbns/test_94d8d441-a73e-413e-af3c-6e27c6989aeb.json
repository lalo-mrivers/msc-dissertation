["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the origin of certain cell types. The provided documents discuss the development of endoderm cells from the ICM, the differentiation of rat endoderm in vitro, and the establishment and organization of germ layers in the gastrulating mouse embryo. From these studies, it can be concluded that the primary endoderm cells are derived from the ICM, which is composed of both extraembryonic endoderm and mesoderm. The embryonic endoderm (visceral endoderm) and the parietal endoderm have a common origin and develop from the primitive ectoderm of the egg cylinder. The ultrastructural analysis of rat endoderm in vitro shows that endodermal cells differentiate only if they are in contact with or in close proximity to developing mesenchymal cells. Endoderm differentiating into the respiratory epithelium in turn directed differentiation of the underlying vascular-stromal cells into lamina propria cells and chondrocytes.\n\nBased on these studies, it can be inferred that endodermal cells have a specific origin from the ICM and require interaction with mesenchymal cells for proper differentiation. The documents also discuss the histopathologic evidence and review of the literature supporting an endodermal origin for digestive and respiratory tract APUD cells.\n\nApplying this knowledge to the options, it can be concluded that all options except one are of endodermal origin: epithelial cells of intestine (A), odontoblasts (B), goblet cells (C), and hepatocytes (D).\n\nThe exception is option B, which refers to odontoblasts. Odontoblasts are cells responsible for forming dentin in teeth, and their origin is not mentioned in the provided documents as being related to the endoderm.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B: Odontoblasts.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
