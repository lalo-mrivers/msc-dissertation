["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe methods for estimating age and sex from bone measurements. The document '[The determination of age and sex from measure of the humerus (author's transl)]' describes a method for estimating age based on macroscopic measurements of the humerus, including weight, volume, areal and thickness dimensions of the shaft center. However, this method does not provide information on predicting height. The document 'Stature estimation from femur and humerus by regression and autometry' presents multiple methods for estimating stature from a single extremity bone, but these methods do not apply to the given situation. Therefore, we must look for other clues.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
