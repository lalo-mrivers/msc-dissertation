["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe different methods of direct bonding orthodontic brackets to enamel surfaces. In 'Direct bonding of orthodontic brackets', the maximum average bond strength to enamel was 121 Kg. per square centimeter, but the attachment of the adhesive to the bracket material is the bottleneck of the direct-bonding procedure. The document also discusses preconditioning procedures to enhance the bonding between adhesive and bracket. This suggests that the retention of the stainless steel brackets is not solely due to a mechanical interlock with mesh at the bracket base (option A).
