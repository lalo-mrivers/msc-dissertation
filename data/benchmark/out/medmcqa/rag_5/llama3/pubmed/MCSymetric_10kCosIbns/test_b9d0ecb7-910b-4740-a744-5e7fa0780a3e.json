["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To find the oxygen carrying capacity of an 18-year-old patient with a hemoglobin of 14 g/dL, we need to consider the relationship between arterial--central venous oxygen differences and calculated oxygen consumptions. The study suggests that arterial oxygen contents of more than 16.2 vol% equivalent to a hemoglobin of 12.5 gm/dl or higher with an oxygen saturation of 95%, provided better arteriovenous oxygen differences, oxygen consumptions, and survival rates than those found with lower hemoglobin values. Therefore, for a patient with a hemoglobin of 14 g/dL, the oxygen carrying capacity is likely to be higher than that of patients with lower hemoglobin levels.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
