["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the highest (longest) and sharpest cusp on the deciduous mandibular first molar. None of the relevant documents mention the size or shape of deciduous molars. Therefore, we need to focus on the anatomy of permanent mandibular molars. The documents do not provide information specific to the deciduous mandibular first molar, but they describe the cusp size hierarchy for different types of molars. However, a pattern emerges that the mesiolingual cusp is often the largest and the distolingual cusp is smaller. In one document, it is mentioned that the distobuccal cusp is second largest in maxillary molars. This information does not directly apply to deciduous mandibular first molars but can be used as a clue. The documents do not provide information about the shape of the cusps, so we cannot determine which one would be the sharpest. However, based on the size hierarchy pattern observed in permanent molars, it is possible that the mesiolingual cusp could also be the highest (longest) and sharpest cusp in deciduous mandibular first molars.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
