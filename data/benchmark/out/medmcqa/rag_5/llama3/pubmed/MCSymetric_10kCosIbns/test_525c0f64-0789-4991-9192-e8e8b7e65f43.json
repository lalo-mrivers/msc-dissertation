["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the prediction of contacts in primary teeth with lack of spacing. In 'Incisor spacing', it describes a technique for patients with missing incisors where the goal is to obtain esthetically proportioned pontics, indicating that spacing or crowding is involved. The same concept is discussed in 'Application of analysis of crowding and spacing of the teeth' where estimates of future spacing or crowding are mentioned. No connection is made between primary teeth contacts and lack of spacing. In 'Guidelines for treatment of missing anterior teeth', it emphasizes prosthetic solutions avoidance, but there's no mention of primary teeth contacts or lack of spacing. Finally, in '[Shape and/or colour anomalies of anterior teeth]', it discusses composite resins and enamel grinding for orthodontic results improvement, without any relation to the primary teeth issue at hand. Therefore, we should look for a connection between primary teeth and lack of spacing, which can be found in 'Application of analysis of crowding and spacing of the teeth', specifically where estimates of future spacing or crowding are mentioned.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
