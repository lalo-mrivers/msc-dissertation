["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about cytokines associated with periapical lesions. From the provided documents, it is clear that immunological reactions play a significant role in periapical lesions. Cytokines are important regulators of immune responses. The study [Immunological phenomena in pulpal-periapical lesions] mentions that cytokines can regulate the intensity and duration of immune responses against potential pathogenic agents. Based on this information, it is likely that cytokines associated with periapical lesions include those involved in the regulation of immune responses.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A: IL-1\"\n}"]
