["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about urobilinogen levels in obstructed jaundice due to gallstones. We need to analyze the relevant documents for any information related to urobilinogen levels in patients with gallstones or obstructive jaundice. The first document suggests that there was no specific serum biochemical pattern characterizes gallstone disease, and that there is no relationship between the stone type and the serum level of the studied quantities. This does not provide any information about urobilinogen levels.\n\nThe second document talks about the differential diagnosis between benign and malignant biliary tract obstruction: discriminative usefulness of some clinical and laboratory data. It discusses the use of Fisher's discriminant analysis to evaluate the diagnostic effectiveness of some laboratory tests in the differential diagnosis between these two conditions. Again, this does not provide any information about urobilinogen levels.\n\nThe third document talks about percutaneous cholecystostomy and cholangiography in patients with obstructive jaundice. It discusses the technique used to diagnose and treat patients with obstructive jaundice. This also does not provide any information about urobilinogen levels.\n\nThe fourth document is a general text about jaundice, its causes and diagnosis. It discusses elevation of alkaline phosphatase and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase as signs of cholestasis, but does not mention urobilinogen levels specifically.\n\nThere is no information in the provided documents that directly addresses the question about urobilinogen levels in obstructed jaundice due to gallstones. Therefore, we can infer that there is no specific information available about this topic from these sources.\", \n\"answer_choice\": D"]
