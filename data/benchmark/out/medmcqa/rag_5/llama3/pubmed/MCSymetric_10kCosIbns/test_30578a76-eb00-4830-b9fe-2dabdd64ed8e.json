["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents suggest that the inheritance of cleft lip and palate is multifactorial. Complex segregation analysis using POINTER and REGD programs found that the Mendelian major locus models were the most parsimonious fit, indicating a putative major locus associated with markedly decreased penetrance. Additionally, mode of inheritance reanalysis supported the involvement of multiple interacting loci or an MFT model. Maternal effects study showed no significant maternal effect in human CL(P) and CP. The review of genetics and genetic counseling highlights that the inheritance is usually multifactorial.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
