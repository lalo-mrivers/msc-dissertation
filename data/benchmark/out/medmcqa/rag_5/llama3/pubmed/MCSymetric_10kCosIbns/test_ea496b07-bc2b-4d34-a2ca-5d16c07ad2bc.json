["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant document about the new method for the identification of cerebrospinal fluid leakage describes a technique based on demonstration of an extra band of transferrin located in the beta 2-fraction of protein electrophoresis of CSF. This technique is used to identify the presence of CSF and can even localize the leak by differential suction. The other methods mentioned, such as X-ray studies, chemical analysis of glucose, protein, and electrolytes, intrathecal staining, and radioactive cisternography, do not involve this transferrin level measurement. Therefore, Î² 2- transferrin level is the correct answer.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
