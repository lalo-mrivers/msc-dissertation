["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the curve of occlusion that touches the buccal and lingual surfaces of mandibular buccal cuspal teeth. This information can be found in the documents provided, specifically in 'Application of \\\"cusp writer\\\" findings to practical and theoretical occlusal problems. Part II.' where it describes the various occlusal determinants including the curve of Spee.\\nAccording to this document, the curve of Spee is a compensating curve that determines the relative cusp height and angulation of one tooth to another from an anterior to a posterior direction in the dental arch. The curve of Spee can also determine the optimal height and angulation of the cusps of the segment.\\nTherefore, it is likely that the curve of occlusion touching the buccal and lingual surfaces of mandibular buccal cuspal teeth is the Curve of Spee.\\nThere are no other options in the provided choices that match this description, so the correct answer is B: Curve of Spee.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
