["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about endotoxin of gram-negative bacteria that do not cause pathogenesis of natural disease. We need to find information from the provided documents related to endotoxins and their effects on mice or humans. The document [Characteristic of endotoxin (and haemolysin) for S-, R- and M-forms of the enteropathogenic \"E. coli\"] mentions that endotoxin of enteropathogenic E. coli O 149 provokes haemorrhagic effects in bones marrow of mice, but does not provoke any changes in 'ligated loop tests'. This implies that this type of endotoxin is capable of causing natural disease in mice.\n\nOn the other hand, [Effects of different types and combinations of antimicrobial agents on endotoxin release from gram-negative bacteria: an in-vitro and in-vivo study] mentions that ceftazidime caused a late 22-fold increase in total endotoxin, while cefuroxime or aztreonam induced a relatively late but much higher release of free endotoxin (118- and 222-fold, respectively). This could be interpreted as these antibiotics do not cause pathogenesis of natural disease.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that E. coli is the answer to this question because it is mentioned in two different contexts: enteropathogenic E. coli O 149 provokes haemorrhagic effects in bones marrow of mice, while other strains of E. coli may or may not cause changes in 'ligated loop tests'. This suggests that some strains of E. coli can cause natural disease, while others do not.\n\nThe provided options are: A: Mycobacterium, B: Klebsiella, C: Vibrio, D: E.coli\n\nTherefore, the answer choice is: D\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
