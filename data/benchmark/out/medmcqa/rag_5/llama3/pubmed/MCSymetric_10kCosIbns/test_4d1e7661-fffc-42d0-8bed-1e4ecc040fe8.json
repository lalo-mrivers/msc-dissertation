["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's hearing loss improves in noisy environments, which suggests that the hearing loss may be retrocochlear. The audiometry report shows a negative Rinne's test and centralized Weber's test, which is consistent with sensorineural hearing loss. Given these findings, we should consider the possibility of acoustic neuroma or vestibular schwannoma, as described in [Retrocochlear deafness, acoustic neurinoma and early evoked auditory potentials--apropos of a series of 113 patients].\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
