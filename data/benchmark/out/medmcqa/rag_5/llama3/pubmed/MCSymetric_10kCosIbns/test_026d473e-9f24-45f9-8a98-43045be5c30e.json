["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The provided documents are related to the size of apical foramen in different types of teeth. There is no specific information about the average diameter of apical foramen in an 18-25 years old adult. However, we can analyze the data from the first document which reports on the area measurements of apical foramen in human permanent teeth. Although the document does not provide a direct answer to this question, it mentions that much variation was observed in the size of the apical foramen even for teeth of the same type. This suggests that there is no fixed average diameter of apical foramen that can be applied to all individuals within the 18-25 years age range.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
