["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Since this question is about class 2 inlay preparation, we need to compare it with amalgam class 2 preparation. The relevant document for amalgam class 2 preparation is 'Adaptation of amalgams to cavity walls'. This document discusses the adaptation of amalgam fillings to the cavity walls and how different types of amalgams can affect this adaptation. There is no direct mention of pulpal floor placement in this document, but it provides information on the interaction between amalgam and enamel. Therefore, we cannot draw a direct comparison between pulpal floors for inlay and amalgam class 2 preparations. However, considering the concept of adaptation and marginal integrity, one might infer that a similar approach to placing the pulpal floor could be suitable.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C: Same as Amalgam\""]
