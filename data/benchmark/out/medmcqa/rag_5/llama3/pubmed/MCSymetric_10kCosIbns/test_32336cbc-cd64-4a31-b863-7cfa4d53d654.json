["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the documents provided, we are looking for information about single accessory canals arising from the coronal third of mandibular molars. The document 'C-shaped canal configurations in mandibular molars' describes three cases where the condition was impossible to diagnose preoperatively, and all had normal anatomy of the pulp floor and separate canal orifices. This suggests that we are looking for information about accessory canals rather than main root canals. Furthermore, since the question specifically asks about single accessory canals arising from the coronal third of mandibular molars, we should focus on documents that describe the morphology of these teeth. The document 'Root canal configuration of the mandibular first premolar' describes the shape and incidence of multiple canals in mandibular premolars, but it does not specifically mention accessory canals or their location.\n\nOn the other hand, the document 'Prevalence, location, and patency of accessory canals in the furcation region of permanent molars' provides information about accessory canals in the furcation region. Although this document does not specifically describe mandibular molars, it does provide valuable information about the prevalence and location of accessory canals.\n\nIn particular, we are looking for information about single accessory canals arising from the coronal third of mandibular molars. The document 'Prevalence, location, and patency of accessory canals in the furcation region of permanent molars' describes the location of accessory canals in the furcation region, but it does not provide specific information about the coronal third.\n\nTherefore, we cannot determine from the provided documents whether single accessory canals arising from the coronal third of mandibular molars arise majorly from the distal root (A), mesial root (B), both equally (C) or do not arise at all (D).\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
