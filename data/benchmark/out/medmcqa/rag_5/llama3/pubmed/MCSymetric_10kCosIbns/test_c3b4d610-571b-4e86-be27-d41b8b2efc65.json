["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The concept of loading dose is related to the calculation of a dose D necessary to reach a certain fraction of the asymptotic value of the amount of drug in a compartment receiving a constant rate infusion. This calculation is based on model parameters, such as volume of distribution and clearance. Therefore, major determinants of loading dose are likely related to these pharmacokinetic parameters.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
