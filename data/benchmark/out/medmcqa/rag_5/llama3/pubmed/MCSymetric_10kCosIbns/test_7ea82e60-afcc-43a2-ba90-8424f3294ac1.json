["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe two series of patients with pyrexia of unknown origin. The first series was seen during 1968-1981, and the second series was seen during 1982-1989. There was a statistically significant decrease in the percentage of infections and an increase in neoplasms and connective tissue disorders in the second series. This suggests that the common causes of pyrexia of unknown origin may have changed over time. The documents also describe cases of colon cancer presenting with pyrexia of unknown origin, which is a rare presentation. Finally, there are discussions of extreme pyrexia, hyperpyrexia of uncertain origin, and host responses during childhood pyrexia. None of these discussions specifically mention the most common single cause of pyrexia of unknown origin.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
