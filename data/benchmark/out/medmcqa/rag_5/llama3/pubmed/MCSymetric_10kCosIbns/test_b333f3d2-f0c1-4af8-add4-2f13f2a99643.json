["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents mention different radiographic views for the temporomandibular joint. The [Interpretation and misinterpretation in occlusion diagnostic radiography of the temporomandibular joint] document mentions one plane radiographs as a simple way to obtain certain information about the temporomandibular joint components. The [Lateral radiography of the temporomandibular joint with a new radiological device] document describes a lateral eccentric visualization of the temporo-mandibular joint using a new radiological arrangement, which gives a symmetrical picture of the condyle, fossa mandibularis, tuberculum articulare and joint space. This suggests that the best radiographic view is not transorbital, reverse Towne's or transpharyngeal views, but rather one that visualizes the lateral aspect of the joint.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
