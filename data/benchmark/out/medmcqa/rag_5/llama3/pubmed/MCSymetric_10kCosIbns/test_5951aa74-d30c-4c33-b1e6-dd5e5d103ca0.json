["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Phosphorus is an essential element for biological systems. According to the 'Phosphorus biochemistry' document, phosphorus is always handled as phosphate and its uptake and incorporation are associated with energy consumption. This suggests that phosphate plays a crucial role in metabolism and synthesis. The 'Clinical applicability of inorganic phosphate measurements' document highlights the pivotal role of phosphate in intermediary metabolism and its close relationship with ionized calcium. Therefore, it can be inferred that maximum amount of phosphate is present in bones.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
