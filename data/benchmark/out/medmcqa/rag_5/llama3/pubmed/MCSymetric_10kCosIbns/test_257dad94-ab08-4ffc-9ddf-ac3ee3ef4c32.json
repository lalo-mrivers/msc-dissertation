["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about where guiding cusps occlude. The relevant documents provide information on cusp angulations and occlusal determinants. From Part II of the first document, it is stated that (3) Cusps appear to be steep or shallow relative to each other, to the plane of occlusion, and to the plane of motion. This suggests that guiding cusps may occlude in relation to these planes. Additionally, from Anterior guidance--the key to successful occlusal treatment, we know that the anterior teeth protect the posterior teeth by disoccluding them in eccentric positions. This implies that guiding cusps may occlude on the lingual or incisal surfaces of the anterior teeth.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"]
