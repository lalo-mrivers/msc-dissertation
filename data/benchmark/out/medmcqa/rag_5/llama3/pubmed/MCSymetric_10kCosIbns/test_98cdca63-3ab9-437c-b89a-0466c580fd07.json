["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about continuous murmurs. From the given documents, we can see that innocent murmurs are described as systolic murmurs that radiate from the apex of the heart to the neck. These murmurs are characterized by their exceptional intensity and raspy character at the base, becoming softer at the apex and in the axilla. The document also mentions that aortic stenosis is associated with high-pitched diastolic murmur.\n\nThe document 'Aortic origin of innocent murmurs' suggests that innocent murmurs are produced at the aortic rather than the pulmonary valve, possibly because of the greater compliance of the pulmonary artery, which may have a damping effect upon turbulence. This information helps to rule out VSD with aoic regurgitation (option A) and Patent ductus aeriosus (option D), as these conditions would not produce innocent murmurs.\n\nThe document 'Musical murmurs: an echo-phonocardiographic study' mentions that echocardiography is a useful noninvasive tool in identifying the site of origin of musical murmurs. This information helps to rule out Coronary AV fistula (option B) and Pulmonary AV fistula (option C), as these conditions would require invasive procedures to diagnose.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the given documents, we can determine that continuous murmur cannot be heard in patients with Patent ductus aeriosus.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
