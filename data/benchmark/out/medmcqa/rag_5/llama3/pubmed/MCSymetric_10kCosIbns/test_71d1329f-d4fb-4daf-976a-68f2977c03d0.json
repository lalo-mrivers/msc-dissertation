["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the construction of denture bases from pour resins and mention problems such as porosity, voids, and shrinkage during curing. In one study, it is mentioned that acrylic composites reinforced with carbon cloth have superior mechanical properties compared to acrylic resin. This suggests that resin shrinkage can lead to issues like porosity. The documents also describe the processing of denture bases by different methods, including microwave curing, but do not provide direct information on the causes of porosity in acrylic dentures. However, it is likely that prolonged curing cycle or lack of sufficient pressure applied to flask could be contributing factors.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
