["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the provided documents, it is clear that cell injury can be reversible or irreversible. Reversible cell injury refers to changes that occur in the cell's ultrastructure in response to injury, but which are ultimately repairable. Irreversible cell injury refers to damage that is so severe that it leads to cell death and necrosis. The document highlights that the patterns of cell injury seen in patients dying from shock and trauma are similar to those produced by hypoxic tissue injury in experimental systems. Based on this information, we can infer that reversible cell injury features include changes that allow the cell to attempt to repair or adapt to the injury. This would include swelling of ER (ER swelling), deposition of densities in mitochondria (Dens deposition of mitochondria) and detachment of ribosomes (Detachment of ribosome). Blebs are not specifically mentioned as a feature of reversible cell injury, but rather as a morphological change that can occur during inflammation.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
