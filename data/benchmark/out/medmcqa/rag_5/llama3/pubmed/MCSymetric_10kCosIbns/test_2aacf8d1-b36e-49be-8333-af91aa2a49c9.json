["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The provided documents describe the histology of human glaucoma cupping and optic nerve damage. The study found no selective loss of astrocytes at the optic nervehead in early glaucoma cupping. Acquired increases in optic disc cup size prior to detectable visual field loss probably represent loss of ganglion cell axonal fibers, which is not yet significant enough to produce field defects. The documents also describe changes in ciliary ganglion cells after experimental induction of glaucoma in rhesus monkeys and changes in the monkey optic nervehead during development of glaucomatous cupping. These changes include degenerative changes in eyes with higher intraocular pressure and longer duration of glaucoma, as well as accumulation of mitochondria and dense bodies anterior and posterior to collagenous septae. Finally, the documents describe age changes of the human optic nerve head and a clinicopathologic study of autosomal dominant optic atrophy. Based on these findings, it appears that ganglion cells are affected in glaucomatous optic neuropathy.\", \"answer_choice\": C}"]
