["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, I look at the relevant documents. The first document talks about fixation of cytological preparations obtained by percutaneous fine needle biopsy, but it doesn't mention a specific fixative for routine biopsy specimens. The second document is about a new method of specimen preparation and does not discuss fixation techniques. The third document compares different fixatives for laboratory rat tissues, including 10% neutral buffered formalin, Carnoy's fluid, and Bouin's fluid. This information suggests that 10% formalin could be a suitable fixative for a routine biopsy specimen. The fourth document is about proper biopsy technique for immunofluorescence tests on skin and does not provide information about fixation techniques for biopsy specimens.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
