["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents discuss the importance of avoiding bias when selecting patients for controlled trials. It emphasizes that patient selection is a complicated process and that we must ensure that any biases included do not affect the results. In the context of prognostic factors, it highlights the need to account for these factors in the study analysis to obtain valid estimates. None of the answer choices provided involve systematic random sampling, simple random sampling, or cluster sampling. Therefore, I will focus on stratified random sampling and how it relates to patient selection. Stratified random sampling can be used to select patients based on certain characteristics, which is relevant to selecting patients with respect to potential factors that will affect the results.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
