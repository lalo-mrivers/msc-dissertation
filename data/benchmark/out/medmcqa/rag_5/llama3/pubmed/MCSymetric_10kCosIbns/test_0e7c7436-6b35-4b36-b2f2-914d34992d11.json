["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about an incision given within the hairline, 45° to zygoma. This description does not match with Alkat Bramley or Morey as they are not related to zygoma. Risdon is a surgical approach for reduction of zygomatic fractures, but it doesn't specify that the incision is within the hairline and 45° to zygoma. Gillies temporal approach involves an incision behind the hairline, which can be at an angle of around 45° to access the zygoma. Therefore, the answer must be A: Gillies temporal.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
