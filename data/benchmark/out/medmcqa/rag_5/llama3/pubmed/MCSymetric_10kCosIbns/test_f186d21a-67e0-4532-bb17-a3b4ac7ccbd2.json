["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents provided are related to the biocompatibility of chromium-cobalt alloys, suitability of investment compounds for casting precious metal alloys, dissolution of cobalt from hard metal alloys by cutting fluids, mechanical properties of Co-Cr-Ni ternary alloys and high strength Co-Cr-Mo alloy by hot isostatic pressing of powder. The documents do not provide specific information about the exact composition of Cobalt-Chromium alloys. Therefore, we cannot directly determine the percentage of cobalt and chromium. However, based on the information provided, we can infer that the percentages may vary depending on the specific Co-Cr-Mo alloy being referred to.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
