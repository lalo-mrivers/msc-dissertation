["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks what health education includes all except. The relevant documents discuss the goals of health education as increasing knowledge about physical and psychological health, diseases, and their causes; influencing attitudes concerning health problems; and influencing behavior (nutrition, smoking, way of life, exercise). Health education is also recognized as a public health intervention to address health challenges. The educational approach to change involves identifying health behaviors which are consequential to health promotion, disease prevention, and health care utilization.

None of the answer choices explicitly state any of these goals or approaches. Therefore, we can conclude that none of the options accurately represent what health education includes.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
