["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe root resections or amputations for various purposes, such as removing fractured roots (Removing broken roots--a simple method) or treating furcation problems and deep periodontal pockets (Results of hemisections and root amputations in a general practice). In the context of apical resection following retrograde obturation, the technique described is to provide mechanical treatment and complete obturation of the root canal by shortened Kerr wires. This does not involve actual resecting of the root end. Therefore, it is likely that 1mm or less is being referred to as the extent of the resection.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
