["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about what is common to both zinc oxide eugenol cement and polycarboxylate cement. From the documents provided, we can see that both cements are mentioned separately in different contexts. However, if we look at the properties of the four dental cements, we can see that the tests on 4 cements showed no significant difference in the retentive property of zinc phosphate and polycarboxylate cements but significant differences existed between these and two zinc oxide eugenol (modified) materials. This suggests that both zinc oxide eugenol cement and polycarboxylate cement may have similar properties.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
