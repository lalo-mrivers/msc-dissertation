["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the contents of the mesorectal fascia. The relevant documents mention perineum, pelvic viscera, sacrum, and anus. From these, we can infer that the mesorectal fascia is related to the anal canal. The document 'Contribution of imaging to the understanding of the female pelvic fasciae' describes the female perineum organized around the musculofascial system converging towards the fibrous structure of the central perineal tendon (CPT). Behind the CPT, the fascial layers form part of a fibrous assembly extending from the ventral surface of the sacrum to the anal complex. Therefore, we can conclude that the mesorectal fascia contains structures related to the anal canal.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
