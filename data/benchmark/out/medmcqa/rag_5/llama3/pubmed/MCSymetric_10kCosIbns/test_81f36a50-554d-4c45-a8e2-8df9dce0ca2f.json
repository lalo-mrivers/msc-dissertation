["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The citric acid cycle is also known as the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. According to [Mechanism of the reaction of substrate phosphorylation in the tricarboxylic acid cycle], substrate level phosphorylation occurs when CoA binds to an enzyme, resulting in a high-energy compound. This process involves the formation of succinyl phosphate linked with the enzyme (E.succinyl--P). The energy from this reaction is used to produce ATP.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
