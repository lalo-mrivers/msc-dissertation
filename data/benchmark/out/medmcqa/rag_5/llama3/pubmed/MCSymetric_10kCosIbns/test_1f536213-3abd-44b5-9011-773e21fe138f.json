["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the most rapid way to synthesize ATP during exercise. The abstracts provided indicate that anaerobic glycolysis provides approximately 80% of the total ATP provided during intense exercise lasting approximately 3 min. Additionally, direct measurements show that the maximal rate of anaerobically derived ATP provision from PCr degradation and glycolysis during intense muscular activity are each approximately 9-10 mmol.kg-1 dm.s-1. It is clear that both pathways are activated instantaneously at the onset of maximal activity.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
