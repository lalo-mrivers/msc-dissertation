["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the provided documents, it can be seen that Mastication and swallowing: an overview describes the cycles of jaw and tongue movement during feeding. It mentions that when hard food is eaten, there are two phases of closure, and in cycles with a mainly transport function (eating soft food), the antero-posterior movements of the tongue are much greater. This implies that the pattern of jaw movement during closing and opening varies with food consistency. The swallow that occurs in normal feeding consists of the equivalent of the classical second stage of swallowing inserted into the occlusal or initial jaw opening phase of an otherwise standard cycle.
