["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents provide information on vitamin K's role in human nutrition and its metabolism. It is mentioned that vitamin K functions as a co-factor for the post-translational carboxylation of specific glutamate residues to gamma-carboxyglutamate (Gla) residues in several blood coagulation factors, including prothrombin (factor II), factor VII, factor IX, and factor X. This information suggests that vitamin K-dependent clotting factors include at least two of the options: factor II and factors VII, IX, and X. Additionally, the text states that 'nonfunctional clotting factors are synthesized and hemorrhage can result' in the absence of vitamin K, which further supports the idea that factor II is a vitamin K-dependent clotting factor. Furthermore, the diagram presented in 'The role of vitamins in hemostasis' shows the action of the vitamin K-dependent clotting factors, including prothrombin (factor II), factors VII, IX and X., \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
