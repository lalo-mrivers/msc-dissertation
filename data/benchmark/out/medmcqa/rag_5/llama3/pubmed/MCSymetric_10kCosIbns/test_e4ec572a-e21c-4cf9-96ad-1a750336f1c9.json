["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The provided documents discuss the structure, function, and possible clinical applications of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta). While there is no specific information on the half-life of TGF-beta, we can infer some details from the descriptions of its binding to cell surface receptors and activation. The documents suggest that TGF-beta is a multifunctional protein with a complex regulatory network, and its actions are mediated by binding to specific cell surface receptors. There is no mention of a specific half-life for TGF-beta.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: 3-5 min\""]
