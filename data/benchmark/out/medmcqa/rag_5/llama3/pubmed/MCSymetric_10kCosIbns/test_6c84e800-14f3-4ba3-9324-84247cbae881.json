["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the first-order neuron of the visual pathway. After reviewing the relevant documents, I found that photoreceptors are responsible for converting light into electrical signals in the retina (not directly involved in processing visual information at higher levels). Bipolar neurons are also not a good fit as they are part of the retinal ganglion layer and transmit signals from the photoreceptors to the lateral geniculate nucleus. The question is asking about the first-order neuron that processes visual information, which would be located in the primary visual cortex or earlier stages of processing. The documents do not specifically mention the lateral geniculate body as a processing stage.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
