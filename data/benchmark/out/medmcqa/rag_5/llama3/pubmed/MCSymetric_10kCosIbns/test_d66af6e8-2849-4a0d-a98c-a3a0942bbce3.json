["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about a 6-month-old child with Tetralogy of Fallot who develops cyanotic spell initiated by crying. According to the documents, cyanotic spells in Tetralogy of Fallot may result from mechanoreceptor stimulation from the right ventricle, which can trigger a reflex resulting in hyperventilation and some peripheral vasodilation without bradycardia. This suggests that the child's cyanotic spell is likely related to increased contractility of the right ventricle. Isoprenaline is a sympathomimetic agent that can increase contractility of the heart, which would exacerbate the situation. Therefore, it would be reasonable to avoid using Isoprenaline in this case.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
