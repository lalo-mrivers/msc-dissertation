["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The anemia associated with leukemia is described in various documents. In [Accompanying hemolysis in lymphoproliferative diseases], patients with non-Hodgkin lymphomas had autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AHA) which was a bad prognostic factor in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. This suggests that the anemia is not due to iron deficiency or megaloblastic type. In [Acute leukemia in adults], thrombocytopenia, anemia and hemorrhagic signs were more common in acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) patients. This implies that the anemia may be related to bone marrow failure rather than blood loss. Finally, in [Hypoplastic acute leukemia], pancytopenia was a characteristic feature of hypoplastic acute leukemia, suggesting that the anemia is due to bone marrow failure rather than other causes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"]
