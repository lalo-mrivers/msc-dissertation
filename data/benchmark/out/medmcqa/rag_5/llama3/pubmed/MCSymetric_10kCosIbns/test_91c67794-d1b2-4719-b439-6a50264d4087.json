["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, it is evident that none of the alloys mentioned have been specifically studied for their twinning properties. However, one document does mention a nickel-titanium (nitinol) alloy and its shape memory property associated with martensitic solid-state transformation. This implies that the alloy has a tendency to undergo a phase change in response to changes in temperature or stress, which is not directly related to twinning. Therefore, we cannot definitively determine which metal shows the property of twinning based on the provided information.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
