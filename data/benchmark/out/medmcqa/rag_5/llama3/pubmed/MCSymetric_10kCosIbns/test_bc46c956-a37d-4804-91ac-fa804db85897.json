["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the most useful parameter according to WHO in assessing adequacy of sperms for fertilization. The relevant document mentions different semen parameters, including morphology evaluation using strict criteria and progressive motile sperm density. The study found that morphology evaluation using strict criteria is the best predictor of IVF outcome, and it also shows that if both morphology evaluation and motile concentration are below certain cut-off points, the fertilization rate per oocyte is very low. Therefore, based on this information, the most useful parameter according to WHO in assessing adequacy of sperms for fertilization would be D: Spermatocyte morphology.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
