["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Since the provided documents are related to the properties of gypsum products, we can analyze them to find a connection between the mix and the setting expansion. The Experimental study on usage and dosage of gypsum shows that the content of calcium ion Ca2+ in gypsum decoction has been determined with coordination titration. There is no direct mention of the effect of thinner mix on setting expansion. However, the [Thermal behavior of gypsum bonded investments. (Part I) Thermal behavior in heating process(author's transl)] suggests that dehydration of gypsum causes the first shrinkage between 100 degrees C and 200 degrees C. This could indicate a potential impact on setting expansion.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
