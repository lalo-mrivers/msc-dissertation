["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the given documents, we can see that the morphologic structure of anorganic dental calculus was studied by means of scanning electron microscopy. The study found that the morphology of the calculus is composed of two components with distinguishable patterns of calcification. One component is formed by the precipitation of minute calcific crystals on microorganisms and intermicrobial substances (plaque matrix). The other component exhibits a configuration of generally larger crystal growths of varying shapes and sizes, comparable to what has been observed as 'types A & B centers of mineralization' by transmission electron microscopy. According to the document 'Proteolipid and calculus matrix calcification in vitro', the calcific precipitation in type A centers was identified by X-ray diffraction as hydroxyapatite.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
