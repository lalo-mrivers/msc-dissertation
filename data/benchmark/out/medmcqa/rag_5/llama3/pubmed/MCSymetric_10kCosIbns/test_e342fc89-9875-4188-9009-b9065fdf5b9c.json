["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks for a stable element in Ti6Al4V alloy in alpha phase. From the provided documents, we can identify that Ti6Al4V is a titanium alloy with 6% aluminum and 4% vanadium. We know from other sources that the alpha phase is composed of only titanium and aluminum, as vanadium is not part of this phase. Therefore, the stable elements in Ti6Al4V in alpha phase are either titanium or aluminum.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: Al, V\""]
