["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents discuss the correlation between cusp angulations and occlusal determinants. Cusp writings demonstrate that cusps appear to be steep or shallow relative to each other, to the plane of occlusion, and to the plane of motion. The curve of Spee determines the relative cusp height and angulation of one tooth to another, from an anterior to a posterior direction in the dental arch. The graphs show that the flatter the curve of Spee, the more uniform the cusp height and angulations are from anterior to posterior teeth.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
