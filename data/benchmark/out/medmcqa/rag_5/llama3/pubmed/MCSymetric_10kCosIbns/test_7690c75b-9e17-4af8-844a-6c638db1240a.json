["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The reviewed literature indicates that axillary and rectal temperatures are measures of shell temperature and esophageal and tympanic temperatures are measures of core temperature. The study compared temperatures measured with axillary mercury-in-glass and electronic thermometers with those measured by tympanic and esophageal thermometers in 96 postanesthesia patients. Analysis of the data using paired t test indicated there was no significant difference between the esophageal and tympanic temperatures; however, significant differences were found between mercury and electronic axillary temperatures.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
