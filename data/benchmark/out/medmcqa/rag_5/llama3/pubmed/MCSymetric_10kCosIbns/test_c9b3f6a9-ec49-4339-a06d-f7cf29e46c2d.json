["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks for the most accurate method of determination of working length in a tooth with open apex. The relevant documents highlight various methods including X-rays, electronic devices, and the forameter. However, since the apical constriction is not visible on X-rays when the apex is open, we can rule out X-ray based methods. Electronic apex locators are mentioned as useful additional devices but may not provide exact measurements. The forameter is an instrument specifically designed for measuring root canal length, but its accuracy in living teeth is questionable. Therefore, considering these limitations and options, it seems that the most accurate method would be one that directly measures the length of the root canal.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
