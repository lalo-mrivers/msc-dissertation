["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Since the question is asking about the first radiographic sign of chronic pulpal infection of primary molars, I will focus on finding information related to pulp diseases and their imaging findings. In one of the provided documents [Dental pulp diseases of the deciduous teeth. II. Clinical classification], it discusses pulp obliteration which can be a result of chronic pulpal infection. However, this document does not explicitly mention the radiographic signs of chronic pulpal infection. The other documents do not seem to provide relevant information either. Therefore, I will rely on general knowledge and dental imaging principles. Chronic pulpal infection in primary molars is often characterized by periapical lesions which can be detected radiographically. Periapical bony changes are a common sign of chronic pulpitis in primary teeth.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
