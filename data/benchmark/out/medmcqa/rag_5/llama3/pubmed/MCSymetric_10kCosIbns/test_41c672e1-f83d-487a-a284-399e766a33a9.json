["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the type of bone present in the inter-radicular area. From the given documents, we can see that one document discusses the fate of vital and devitalized bone grafts in the healing of interradicular lesions. In this study, fresh cancellous bone was transplanted into 32 defects, and other cancellous bone grafts were devitalized by boiling and transplanted into 34 bifurcations. The results show that the fate of vital and devitalized grafts is similar during the healing of interradicular lesions. This suggests that cancellous bone may be present in the inter-radicular area.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
