["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the provided documents, we can see that the transport of CO is studied in different contexts. In one study, it is shown that measured red cell initial CO uptake rates were compared with calculated rates at the same PCO-PO2 based on the Gibson-Roughton rate equation (Gibson and Roughton, Proc. R. Soc. B 143: 310-334, 1955) for a well mixed Hb solution. This suggests that red cell CO uptake rate is reaction-rate-limited in vivo. In another study, it is found that steady-state diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide (DLCO) increased and reached a maximum as the inspired CO level was raised from 190 to 600 ppm, but further increases in inspired CO concentration were accompanied by a decrease in DLCO. This suggests that there may be carrier-mediated CO transport in the alveolar capillary membrane. Finally, in another study, it is shown that diffusion of (14)C-labeled CO(2) was measured through lipid bilayer membranes composed of egg lecithin and cholesterol (1:1 mol ratio) dissolved in n-decane. The results indicate that different steps in the transport process are rate limiting under different conditions.\n\nConsidering these studies, we can see that the transport of CO is affected by various factors such as PCO-PO2, inspired CO level, and carrier-mediated transport. Therefore, it is not diffusion limited because of any one of these factors.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
