["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The provided documents discuss different indices of burden and their relevance to biomedical research. The 'Priorities in Biomedical Research' document highlights the importance of considering the relative burden of diseases when allocating resources for research. It proposes five indices of burden: inpatient days, outpatient referrals, consultations in family practice, sickness benefit, and loss of expectation of life. The 'Indices of Burden' paper suggests that these indices can be used to understand the different burdens on services imposed by diseases of comparable prevalence.\n\nThe 'Methodological Approach to Calculating Economic Losses Caused by Diseases' document discusses the concept of 'Relative damage to national economy caused by disease', which is a measure of the economic impact of diseases. This index is not directly relevant to the question, but it highlights the importance of considering the economic burden of diseases.\n\nThe 'Gross National Health Product: A Proposed Population Health Index' paper proposes an index that integrates mortality and disability data into a single number in units of disability-free life years lived per 100,000 population. This index is not directly relevant to the question either, but it shows the importance of considering both mortality and morbidity when assessing the burden of disease.\n\nThe 'Mortality, Morbidity, and Resource Allocation' document discusses the correlation between age-standardized mortality-rates and morbidity-rates, suggesting that mortality may not be a valid indicator of morbidity. This information is relevant to the question as it highlights the complexity of comparing different health outcomes.\n\nThe 'Making Annual Indexes of Health' paper proposes a discrete-state, continuous-time Markov model of health states and state transition probabilities as the basis of a health index that reflects the annual health distribution and expected health changes of a population. This information is not directly relevant to the question.\n\nBased on this analysis, it seems that the best index for burden of disease is one that takes into account both mortality and morbidity data, as well as their relative contributions to the overall burden.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
