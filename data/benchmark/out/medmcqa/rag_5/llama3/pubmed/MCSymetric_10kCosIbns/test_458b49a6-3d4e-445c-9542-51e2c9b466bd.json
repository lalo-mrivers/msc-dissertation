["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the reflexes that appear at birth. The provided documents describe various reflexes observed in newborns. The 'Visual behavior of the premature infant' document mentions ocular reflexes studied at birth, which suggests that some visual reflexes are present at birth. The 'Asymmetric action in the human newborn' document discusses movement asymmetry and elicited reflexes, but it does not specify when these reflexes appear. The other documents do not directly address this question.\n\nLooking at the available options, Landau's reflex is a type of stepping reflex that typically appears around 7-8 months of age, which means it does not appear at birth (Source: [1]). Babinski's reflex, Startle reflex, and Moro's reflex are all present in newborns. Therefore, we can deduce that the correct answer is A: Landau reflex.\n\nThe document on neurologic symptoms and syndromes does not provide information on specific reflexes or their timing of appearance.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
