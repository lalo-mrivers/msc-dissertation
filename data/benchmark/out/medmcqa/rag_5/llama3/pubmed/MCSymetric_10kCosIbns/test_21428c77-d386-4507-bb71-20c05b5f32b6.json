["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe various syndromes and anomalies related to craniofacial development. Acrocephalosyndactyly (ACS) is mentioned as a group of diseases with premature sutural craniosynostosis and hand and foot anomalies. There are no specific references to acrocephaly being described as 'dome shaped skull'. However, it's related to the premature closure of certain sutures in the skull, which can result in a range of phenotypes including oxycephaly (peaked skull). Turticephaly is not mentioned at all.
