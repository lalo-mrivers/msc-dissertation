["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant information about the mandibular fracture is found in [Subcondylar mandibular fracture]. It mentions that the site of the fracture affects the treatment. The article also talks about masticatory muscles affecting the bone fragments' stability. In this case, since it's a bilateral fracture in the canine region, we should focus on the muscles involved in that area. According to [Functional analytic studies on mandibular motility after fractures of the mandibular condyle], the restriction of mandibular mobility does not always correspond to fracture-mechanical expectations. This tells us that the movement pattern might change after the trauma.\n\nThe relevant information about the muscles involved is found in [Influence of the maxillary canine on mandibular fracture]. It suggests that a direct blow or bending force around the maxillary canine tooth can result in traumatic injury. Since we're dealing with bilateral fractures, it's likely that the masticatory muscles are affected. Considering this, we should focus on the muscles involved in the canine region.\n\nThe relevant information about these muscles is found in [Facial nerve injury secondary to lateral displacement of the mandibular ramus]. It mentions facial nerves and the mandibular ramus, which are not directly related to our question. However, it does mention the masticatory muscles' role in the fracture's stability.\n\nThe relevant information about the immediate reconstruction of an orbital complex fracture with autogenous mandibular bone is found in [Immediate reconstruction of an orbital complex fracture with autogenous mandibular bone]. This article discusses a different type of fracture and doesn't provide any information about bilateral mandibular fractures or the muscles involved.\n\nConsidering all the relevant information, we should focus on the masticatory muscles involved in the canine region. The masseter muscle is one of these muscles. It's likely that the masseter muscle will tend to pull the mandible back after a bilateral fracture in the canine region.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
