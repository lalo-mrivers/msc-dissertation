["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about a wedge technique for buccolingual wide proximal box. Looking at the provided documents, we see that one of the articles discusses a technique for correcting anterior crossbite in a dog using lingual bars and labial bows. This technique involves wedging, but it's not directly applicable to human teeth or the given scenario. Another article describes a Separate Arch System, which is an orthodontic treatment method, but it doesn't involve wedge techniques for proximal boxes. The remaining articles discuss surgical procedures, including osteotomies and arthrodesis, but they don't provide any information on wedge methods for buccolingual wide proximal box.\n\nGiven the lack of relevant information in the provided documents, we must rely on general knowledge of orthodontic techniques to make an educated guess. Based on our understanding of dental anatomy and biomechanics, we can conclude that the correct answer is likely related to a technique used to address issues with tooth alignment or proximal contacts.\n\nConsidering this, option C: Piggy back seems plausible as it's a common term in orthodontics referring to the use of one bracket or wire on top of another. This could be relevant to addressing buccolingual wide proximal boxes. Option A: Wedge wedgging might also apply, but we don't have enough information to confirm this.\n\nHowever, options B and D are less likely as wedge wedgging is not a standard technique for addressing proximal box issues. Additionally, the absence of any concrete evidence supporting double wedgging or no wedging method makes these options less plausible.\n\nIn conclusion, based on our analysis and educated guesswork, we believe that option C: Piggy back is the most likely correct answer.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
