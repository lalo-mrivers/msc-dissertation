["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents provided discuss the thermic behavior of dental enamel, dentin, and selected dental materials. One document mentions that a good correlation was found between hard dental texture and a phosphate glass envisioned for use with lasers. Another document discusses the linear coefficient of expansion of enamel, dentin, as well as selected dental working materials. These documents suggest that tooth has a unique thermic behavior. Therefore, I will compare the coefficients of thermal expansion of the given options to those mentioned in the provided documents. The relevant information is not explicitly stated in the documents, but we can infer from the discussions that tooth has a relatively low coefficient of thermal expansion compared to other materials.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
