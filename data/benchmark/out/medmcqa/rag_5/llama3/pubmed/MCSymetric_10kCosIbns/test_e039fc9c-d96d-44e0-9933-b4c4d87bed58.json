["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents suggest that absent testicular vessels are indicative of testicular agenesis or absence. Therefore, further exploration is not necessary as there would be no testis to find. Scrotal examination would also not be informative as the testis is undescended.
