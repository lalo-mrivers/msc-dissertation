["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents discuss methyl methacrylate resin processing methods and properties. In 'An evaluation of the cure of acrylic resin by three methods', it is mentioned that all samples cured for 9 hours at 75 degrees C had no porosity. This suggests that curing time and temperature are important factors in preventing porosity. Additionally, 'Studies on the dental methacrylic resins (part 4)' discusses flow properties and curing times of pour resins, which can affect porosity. Therefore, it is likely that porosity occurs when the resin is not given enough time to cure properly.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
