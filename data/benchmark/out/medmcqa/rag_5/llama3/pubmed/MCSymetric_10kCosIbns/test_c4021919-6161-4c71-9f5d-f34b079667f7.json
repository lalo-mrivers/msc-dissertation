["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about Young's formula for calculating pediatric dose. From the provided documents, it can be seen that the formula takes into account the differences in body water compartments between pediatric and adult populations. The formula should also consider the slower elimination rate in younger children. The document [Pharmacokinetics and dosage regimen in children (author's transl)] states that the distribution volume in infants is normally substantially greater than in older children, and for infants the first or single dose has to be higher in relation to body weight. Therefore, the formula should include a factor that increases with age. This suggests that option A: Age / Age+12 x Adult dose is the most plausible answer.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
