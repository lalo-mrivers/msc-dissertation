["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the muscle that divides the sub-mandibular gland into a superficial and deep part. We can analyze the provided documents to find the answer. The [Surgical anatomy of the submandibular triangle] document describes the topographic anatomy of the submandibular triangle and its contents, including four surgical planes. It does not provide information about which muscle divides the sub-mandibular gland into a superficial and deep part. The [Morphology of muscle fibres in amphibian submandibular muscle] and [The topography of rat submandibular gland parenchyma as observed with S.E.M.] documents are also not relevant to this question, as they focus on the morphology of muscles or glands. The [The ultrastructure of the rabbit submandibular gland] document is too specific and does not provide information about which muscle divides the sub-mandibular gland into a superficial and deep part. Therefore, we need to look for another document that provides relevant information.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
