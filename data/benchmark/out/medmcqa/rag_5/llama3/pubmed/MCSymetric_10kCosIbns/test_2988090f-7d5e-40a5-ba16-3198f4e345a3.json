["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the question, we know that the child can ride a tricycle, climb stairs, and demonstrate some understanding of self-awareness (knows his own name and sex). However, he struggles with expressive language (cannot narrate a story). This pattern is more consistent with the developmental patterns described in 'Developmental patterns of visually handicapped children' where it was noted that 4-5 years old visually handicapped children showed more abstract thought processes. Therefore, we can infer that the child's development age might be similar to that of visually handicapped children around this age range. However, since there is no specific mention of visual impairment in the question, we cannot make a direct comparison. Nevertheless, considering the overall pattern of development and language skills, it seems reasonable to assume that the child is likely around 4-5 years old.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
