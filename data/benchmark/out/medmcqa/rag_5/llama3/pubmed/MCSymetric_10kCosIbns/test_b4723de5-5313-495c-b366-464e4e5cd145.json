["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents provided describe different aspects of adhesion in dentistry. The first document discusses the use of a Gluma adhesion system for bonding composite materials to teeth. The second document presents an investigation into the adhesive properties of dental composite materials, showing poor results for adhesion to dentin and good retention to enamel. The third document provides a general overview of chemical adhesion in dentistry, including the role of surface energies, viscosity, and surface roughness. The fourth document discusses the adhesion of restoration materials to hard tooth structures, including the use of etching with phosphoric acid for microretention.\n\nBased on this information, it is not possible to conclude that the mechanism of adhesion of GIC (glass ionomer cement) restoration with tooth surface is by means of any of the options A-D. The documents do not provide specific information about the bonding mechanism of GIC restorations. However, they do highlight the importance of understanding the chemical and physical properties of materials in order to achieve effective adhesion.\n\nTherefore, the answer choice must be 'None of the above', as the question is based on incomplete or inaccurate information.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"E\""]
