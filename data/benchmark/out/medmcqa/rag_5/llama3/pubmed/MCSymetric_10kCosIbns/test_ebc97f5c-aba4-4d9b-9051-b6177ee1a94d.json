["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the given documents, it is clear that afterload mismatch can be induced if the preload is not allowed to compensate for an increased afterload. The concept of afterload mismatch is used as a basis for characterizing responses to afterload changes in the clinical setting. Therefore, we need to identify the index that measures cardiac afterload accurately. Mean aerial pressure (D) and LV mean systolic pressure (C) are not directly related to afterload mismatch or ventricular function. LV end diastolic pressure (B) is a central hemodynamic parameter that does not enable the occult circulatory disorders to be revealed, unlike the afterload characteristics based on cardiac ultrasound technique. Therefore, the best index to measure cardiac afterload is Total peripheral resistance (D).\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
