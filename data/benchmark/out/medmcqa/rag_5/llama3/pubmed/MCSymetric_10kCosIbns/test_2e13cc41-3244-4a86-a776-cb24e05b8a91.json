["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the provided documents, it can be seen that Desferrioxamine B (DF) is a chelating agent that binds to iron ions. It is known to cause reversible side effects at high doses. The mechanism of action involves intracellular chelation in hepatocytes and extracellular chelation, which can only be activated after saturation of the transferrin iron binding capacity. This suggests that option A: By binding with trivalent Fe3+ is correct.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
