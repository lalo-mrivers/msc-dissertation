Upon reviewing the content, I found that none of the documents mention 'simple bar', 'histogram', 'pie diagram', or 'multiple bar' as a method for denoting continuous variables.

This suggests that graphical methods may be used to visualize and understand continuous variables.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
