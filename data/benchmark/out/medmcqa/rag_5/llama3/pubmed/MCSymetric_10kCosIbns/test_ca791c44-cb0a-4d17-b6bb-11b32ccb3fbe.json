["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The initial use of compression osteosynthesis is described in the first document [Compression osteosynthesis with soft-tissue damage (author's transl)]. The advisability of open reduction with internal fixation by means of compression plates, screws, or tension band is dependant upon the localization and type of fracture, the kind and extent of soft-tissue damage, and also the time factor. This suggests that compression osteosynthesis was initially used for specific types of fractures, particularly those in the vicinity of joints and intra-articular fracture dislocations.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
