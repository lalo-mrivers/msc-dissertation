["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the location of lateral lingual swellings and tuberculum impar. Based on the provided documents, we have a case study describing a rare and complex case of multifocal mucocutaneous lupus tuberculosis with isolated lesion of the tongue. The finding highlights that the weakly positive tuberculin reaction and the discovery of a concomitant myeloproliferative syndrome add interest and complexity to the case. There is also a report on a tuberculous ulcer of the tongue, which is secondary to pulmonary tuberculosis. Furthermore, we have another case study describing systemic tuberculosis initially seen as an oral ulceration, where radiographs of the chest and cultures of sputum were positive for tuberculosis. The diagnosis of tuberculosis should be considered along with carcinoma, syphilis, fungal disease, and trauma whenever granulomatous ulcerations appear in the oral cavity. We can infer that the lateral lingual swellings and tuberculum impar are located at the posterior part of the tongue.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: Posterior 2/3 of tongue\""]
