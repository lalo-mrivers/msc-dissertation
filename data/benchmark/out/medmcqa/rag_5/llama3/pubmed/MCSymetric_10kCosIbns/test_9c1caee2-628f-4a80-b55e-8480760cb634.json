["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the component that sensitizes bacteria and virus to UV irradiation. From the given documents, we can see that near UV light causes damage to cell proteins, which may inhibit DNA-repair systems. Additionally, radiosensitizing drugs are used in the presence of 365 nm ultraviolet light, which indicates that these compounds are capable of killing cells in the absence of other types of radiation damage. The document also mentions the formation of transient species formed by photo-excitation of radiosensitizer molecules, which are capable of killing cells. Therefore, it can be concluded that nucleic acids are the component that sensitizes bacteria and virus to UV irradiation.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
