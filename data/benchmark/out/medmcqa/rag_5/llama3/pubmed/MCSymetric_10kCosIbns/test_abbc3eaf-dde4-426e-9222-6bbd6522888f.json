["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the most common morphological variation. None of the provided documents specifically mention a specific anatomical structure as the most common morphological variation. However, [Anatomical variations and taxonomic relatedness in Hominoidea] mentions that 31 anatomical variations were examined in 125 Pan paniscus and 96 Gorilla gorilla beringei skulls. Comparisons with published data of Hominoidea show that differences in their frequencies are proportional and parallel to taxonomic relationships on the subspecific, specific and generic level. This suggests that morphological variations can be found across various anatomical structures. Since the question is asking about a specific type of variation, it's possible that the answer might not be directly stated in any of the provided documents.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
