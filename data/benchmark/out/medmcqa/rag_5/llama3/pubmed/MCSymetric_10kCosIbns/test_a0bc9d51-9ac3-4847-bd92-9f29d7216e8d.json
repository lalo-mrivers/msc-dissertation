["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about post-moem body traumatic injury of face with one eye missing and some injury on mouth and nose. The right eye ball was missing, and there's blood in the socket area. Given the description of the injuries, it's likely that the cause is related to trauma rather than a medical condition. We can rule out blunt rupture to eyeball as the cause since the entire eye ball is missing. Post-moem artifact is also unlikely as the injury seems too severe for a post-mortem effect. Therefore, we are left with the possibility of evisceration by a sharp weapon, which could have caused the removal of the eye ball and subsequent trauma to the face.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
