["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the morphologic structure of anorganic dental calculus, which is composed of two components with distinguishable patterns of calcification. The first component is formed by the precipitation of minute calcific crystals on microorganisms and intermicrobial substances (plaque matrix). This finding is consistent with the study that describes three types of mineral deposits in early dental calculus: A, B, and C. Type A deposits showing an average Ca/P molar ratio of 1.42 are densely packed with fine needle-shaped crystals formed by intra- and extra-cellular calcification. The other component exhibits a configuration of generally larger crystal growths of varying shapes and sizes. This description is comparable to what has been observed via transmission electron microscopy, which designates these centers as 'types A &amp; B' of mineralization. Therefore, it can be inferred that the portion of tooth covered by calculus or altered cementum is likely related to the formation of one or both of these types.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
