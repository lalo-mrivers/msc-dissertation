["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the mechanical transduction mechanism of Golgi tendon organs (GTOs) as a force transducer that detects tension applied to a muscle's tendon. The studies show that GTOs respond to subtle alterations in motor unit twitch waveform and amplitude, and are sensitive to forces above threshold. Additionally, the responses indicate that every twitch of every motor unit will be reflected in the population of afferent signals projecting to the spinal cord. Therefore, it is clear that GTOs detect muscle tension.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
