["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks which of the options should be considered a 'High risk infant'. We need to analyze the provided documents for relevant information. The Occurrence of risk factors in newborn infants document describes various risk factors at birth, including Apgar score of 6 or less at 5 or 15 minutes, hyperbilirubinaemia, and birth weight of 2000 g or below. Neurodevelopmental examination of high risk infants mentions neurological symptoms, respiratory difficulties, hypoglycaemia, newborn infants of diabetic mothers, and cases with sepsis as high-risk factors. Detection and monitoring of high-risk children defines a 'high-risk baby' based on case history details. Identification of some infants at immediate risk of dying unexpectedly refers to infants defined by a discriminant score that includes data collected at birth and by health visitors at 1 month. The epidemiology of infant cancers does not provide information relevant to the question.\n\nConsidering these documents, we can infer that high-risk infants are those with specific risk factors present at birth or in their early development. None of the options provided (A: Mal-presentation, B: Folic acid tablet not consumed, C: Working mother, D: Antenatal preeclampsia) match the described criteria for high-risk infants.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
