["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the cause of true open bite. The relevant documents provided are case reports on animal bites, treatment options for bite wounds, and a review of mammalian bites. None of these documents mention open bites caused by fractures or injuries to the maxilla, mandible, or symphysis. Therefore, it can be concluded that true open bite is not related to any of these causes. The answer must lie in the field of orthodontics or dentofacial orthopedics, as mentioned in the document on [Open bite and its management]. This suggests that true open bite is caused by an anatomical or developmental issue, rather than a traumatic injury.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"None of the above\"\n}"]
