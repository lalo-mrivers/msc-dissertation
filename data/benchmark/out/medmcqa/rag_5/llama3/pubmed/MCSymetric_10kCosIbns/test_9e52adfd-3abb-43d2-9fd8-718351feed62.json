["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the maximum penetration among different types of rays. From the given documents, we can see that one document discusses X-ray absorption, another mentions a 42 MeV betatron, and one more talks about x-ray protective glass. Given these hints, we can deduce that the correct answer will be related to radiation with high energy or frequency. Among the options, Gamma ray has the highest energy among all three (Alpha, Beta, Gamma), so it's likely the correct choice.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
