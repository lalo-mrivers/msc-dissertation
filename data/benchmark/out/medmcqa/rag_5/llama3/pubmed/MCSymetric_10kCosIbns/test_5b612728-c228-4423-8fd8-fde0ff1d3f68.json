["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents discuss infant mortality and identifying infants at risk. The first document mentions a discriminant score based on data collected at birth and 1 month, which identifies 50% of cot deaths. This suggests that certain factors present at or shortly after birth can be indicative of increased risk of unexpected infant death. The second document describes regular examinations of high-risk babies, with the highest percentage of abnormal findings among premature infants with dyspnea syndrome. This implies that certain medical conditions present in newborns may be a indicator of increased risk. The third document discusses the psychological and neurodevelopmental outcome of high-risk newborns, noting that neonatal cerebral distress is associated with poor prognosis. The fourth document analyzes infant deaths in hospital and finds that 26% of cases were potentially avoidable due to inadequate medical care before admission. Finally, the fifth document discusses the epidemiology of infant cancers, noting that certain types of tumors are more common in infants than in older children. Considering these documents, it appears that a combination of factors including premature birth, medical conditions present at or shortly after birth, and potentially inadequate medical care may be indicative of increased risk for an infant.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
