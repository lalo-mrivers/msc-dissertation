["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the condition where there is absence of precursor cell of an organ with the subsequent non-development of the organ. We need to look for a concept that explains how a tissue or organ develops in relation to its embryonic development. The relevant document is 'Immunohistochemical characterization of primitive neuroectodermal tumors and their possible relationship to the stepwise ontogenetic development of the central nervous system'. This study describes the sequential appearance of different markers during the development of the central nervous system, which suggests that organs develop from a specific sequence of cell types. Therefore, we can infer that the condition is related to a failure in this developmental process.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B: Aplasia\"\n}"]
