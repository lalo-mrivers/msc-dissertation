["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the maximum voltage of the R wave for an ECG with a mean axis of 90 degrees. Since the lead III is a limb lead and it is normally oriented at about 60-70 degrees, this is not the correct answer. The leads I and II are also limb leads but they have different orientations. The leads aVL and aVF are precordial leads which do not have a fixed orientation. Therefore, the maximum voltage of R wave would be in lead III if it was an ECG with a mean axis of 90 degrees.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
