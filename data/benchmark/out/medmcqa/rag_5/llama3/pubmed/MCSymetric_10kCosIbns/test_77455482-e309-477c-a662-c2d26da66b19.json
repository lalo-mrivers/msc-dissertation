["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking which of the options is NOT a cofactor for glycogen phosphorylase. We need to analyze each option to determine if it is a known cofactor or not.\\nFrom the documents provided, we can see that glucose 6-phosphate and AMP are both activators of glycogen phosphorylase. Calmodulin is an activator of some enzymes but not mentioned in relation to glycogen phosphorylase. Protein Kinase A is also not mentioned as a cofactor or inhibitor of glycogen phosphorylase.\\nGlycogenin is not even a relevant term in the context of glycogen phosphorylase, it is actually a protein involved in glycogen biosynthesis.\\nTherefore, based on the information provided, Calmodulin and Glycogenin are not known to be cofactors for glycogen phosphorylase.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
