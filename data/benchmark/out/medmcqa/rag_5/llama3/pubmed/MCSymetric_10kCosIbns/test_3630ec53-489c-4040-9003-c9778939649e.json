["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the Golgi complex as having a transition region with beadlike structures arranged in rings at the base of transition vesicles. This is consistent with previous studies that have shown the existence of an intermediate membrane compartment between the rough endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi complex. The beads are 10 to 12 nanometers in diameter and occur in a variety of cell types and organisms. Furthermore, recent results have provided evidence for the role of this compartment in protein sorting and the regulation of membrane traffic in the early part of the exocytic pathway.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
