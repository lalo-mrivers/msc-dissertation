["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents mention the importance of anoxia-time to the chances of survival after resuscitation. The question is about the ratio of chest compressions and breaths when a lone person is giving cardiopulmonary resuscitation, which is not directly addressed in the provided documents. However, [Therapy of cardiac arrest: cardiopulmonary resuscitation (author's transl)] mentions that an optimal procedure was established for cardiopulmonary resuscitation, but it does not specify the ratio of chest compressions and breaths. Metabolic demands and perceived exertion during cardiopulmonary resuscitation suggests that research investigating CPR demands based on central measures may underestimate actual as well as perceived demands of performing the procedure.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
