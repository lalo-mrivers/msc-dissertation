["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The contractile element is related to the mechanism of muscular contraction. The question states that 'the sliding filament mechanism produced by cross-bridges which form between thick and thin filaments' is responsible for muscle contraction. This process involves interactions between tropomyosin, troponin, and calcium concentration. Therefore, the contractile element must be present in the myofibril, as this is where the thick and thin filaments are located.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
