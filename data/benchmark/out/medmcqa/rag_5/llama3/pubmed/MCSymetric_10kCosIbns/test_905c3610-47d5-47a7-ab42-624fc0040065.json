["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe cases of Pseudomonas aeruginosa endocarditis. The source of infection is known in 8 patients: 7 were nosocomial infections (cardiac catheterization in 5 cases, cardiac surgery in 2 cases). One patient had tricuspid endocarditis which was diagnosed on postmortem examination. None of the documents suggest a relationship between Pseudomonas endocarditis and HIV patients, chronic steroid therapy, or elderly with community acquired pneumonia. Intravenous drug abuse is mentioned as one possible source of infection in one of the documents. Therefore, it is likely that infective endocarditis due to Pseudomonas is most commonly seen with intravenous drug abuse.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
