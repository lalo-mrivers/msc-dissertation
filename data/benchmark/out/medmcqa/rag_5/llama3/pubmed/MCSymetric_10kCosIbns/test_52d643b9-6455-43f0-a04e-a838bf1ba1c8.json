["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the given documents, it is clear that left ventricular failure can result from various conditions. In the document '[Morphologic consideration of heart failure (author's transl)]', it is mentioned that left ventricular failure can lead to dilatation, deformation and loss of funnel function of the left atrium, coiled, dilated and narrow pulmonary veins, fibrosis and septal siderosis in the pulmonary parenchyma. In more advanced stages, necrosis of liver cells with jaundice and elevated levels of liver specific enzymes can occur due to right ventricular failure. This suggests that pure left-sided failure may be seen with conditions that affect the left ventricle without involving the right ventricle or pulmonary circulation.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
