["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 9-year-old boy with steroid-dependent nephrotic syndrome. He has been experiencing the condition for the past 5 years, during which he has developed cushingoid features, high blood pressure (120/86 mmHg), and small subcapsular cataracts. The question asks about the most appropriate therapy choice. After reviewing the documents, I see that the patient's steroid-dependent nephrotic syndrome is resistant to treatment with glucocorticoids. This is indicated by his cushingoid features, which are a common side effect of long-term corticosteroid use. Additionally, the patient has developed small subcapsular cataracts, which suggests prolonged exposure to high levels of cortisol.\n\nGiven this information, I can conclude that the patient's condition does not respond well to further glucocorticoids. Cyclophosphamide is mentioned in one of the documents as a possible treatment option for patients with severe steroid side effects. However, it is not explicitly stated as an alternative therapy for steroid-dependent nephrotic syndrome.\n\nIntravenous immunoglobulin and frusemide (with or without enalapril) are not mentioned as relevant treatments in any of the provided documents. Intravenous pulse corticosteroids may potentially exacerbate the patient's condition, given his resistance to glucocorticoid therapy.\n\nTherefore, I would recommend considering alternative therapies that do not involve further exposure to glucocorticoids.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
