["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 26-year-old female with mild pain in the lower abdomen, palpable mass in the adnexa on pelvic examination, and a 5 cm ovarian cyst on USG. Given that she has had two full-term normal deliveries earlier and her last menstrual period was three weeks back, it's likely that the cyst is functional (non-neoplastic). The study 'Ovarian cysts and tumours in childhood' suggests that over two-thirds of patients with ovarian cysts present as an emergency with abdominal pain. However, this patient's symptoms are mild, suggesting a benign condition. Ultrasonography has already been used to diagnose the cyst, so further imaging is not necessary. The study 'Non-specific abdominal pain in pre-menopausal women' highlights that many gynaecological conditions can cause acute abdominal symptoms. Therefore, it's likely that this patient's symptoms are related to her ovarian cyst. Given that the cyst is small and benign, observation and follow-up would be a reasonable next step.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
