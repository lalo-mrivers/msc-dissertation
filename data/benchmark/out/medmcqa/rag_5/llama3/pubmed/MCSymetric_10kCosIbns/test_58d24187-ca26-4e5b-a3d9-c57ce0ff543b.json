["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents discuss the visual cortex and its organization. In 'Visual cortex: cartography, connectivity, and concurrent processing', it is mentioned that the mammalian visual cortex contains a complex mosaic of areas richly connected with one another. This suggests that the visual cortex is located in a specific region of the brain, which is further supported by 'Convergence of processing channels in the extrastriate cortex of monkeys'. The fact that the dorsomedial visual area (DM) relays to the middle temporal visual area (MT) and posterior parietal cortex suggests that these areas are part of the visual cortex. Finally, 'Magnetic resonance imaging mapping of brain function' provides direct evidence that the human visual cortex is located in the occipital lobe.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
