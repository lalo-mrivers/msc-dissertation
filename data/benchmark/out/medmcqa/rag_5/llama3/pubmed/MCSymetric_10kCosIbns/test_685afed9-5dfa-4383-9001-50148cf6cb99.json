["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"After reviewing the provided documents, I noticed that one of the studies investigated the impact of meteorological factors on the manifestation of myocardial infarction (MI) in the coastal region of central Dalmatia. The study found a significant connection between MI incidence and increased air temperature during south-wind days. This suggests that weather patterns may play a role in the onset of cardiovascular diseases like MI.
