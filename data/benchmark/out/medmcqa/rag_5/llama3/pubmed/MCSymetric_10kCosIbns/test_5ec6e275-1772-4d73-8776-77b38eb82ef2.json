["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about a drug that has gameticidal action against all species of Plasmodium. We need to find the relevant information from the provided documents. The first document discusses antimalarial activity and doesn't mention gameticidal action. The second document is about a mutation in Physarum polycephalum, which isn't related to the question. The third document is about cellular and molecular analysis of Plasmodium development, but it also doesn't provide information on gameticidal action. The fourth document discusses carbohydrate metabolism of malarial parasites, which is not relevant to the question either. Therefore, we need to rely on external knowledge or look up the answer from a reliable source.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
