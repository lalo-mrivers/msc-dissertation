["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the incubation period of LGV (Lymphoid Leukosis Virus), but none of the provided documents explicitly mention the incubation period of LGV. However, one of the documents discusses the establishment of SPF colonies of small laboratory animals and mentions the development of age-related resistance against tumor formation in chickens after 2 months. This could be related to the immune response against LL virus infection, which is mentioned in another document as a method for controlling lymphoid leukosis in chickens. There is no direct information about LGV incubation period, but it's possible that the incubation period of LGV might be similar to or even longer than the age-related resistance development.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: 30-90 days\""]
