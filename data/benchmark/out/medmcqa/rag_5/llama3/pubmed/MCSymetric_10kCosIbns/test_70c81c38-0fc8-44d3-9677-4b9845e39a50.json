["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about deepening the pulpal floor during cavity preparation. The relevant documents mention cavity preparations and pulp studies. From the study 'Conservation of human research teeth by controlling cavity depth', we know that many valuable teeth are wasted by making cavity preparations that are either too shallow or too deep, with consequent pulp exposures. This suggests that the depth of the pulpal floor is important. The document 'Effect of cavity depth on stresses in a restored tooth' shows that after placement of restorative materials, the dentin experienced a dramatic change in stress gradient immediately below the pulpal wall, and this response was magnified in deeper cavity preparations. Therefore, deepening the pulpal floor during cavity preparation would lead to increased stresses in the remaining tooth structure.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: Resistance form\"\n}"]
