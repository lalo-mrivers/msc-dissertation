["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the nerve supply of the adrenal gland. We can look at the relevant documents to find the answer. The first document talks about the connections of superficial and internal adrenal veins, but it doesn't mention anything about the nerve supply. The second document discusses the blood supply of the mammalian adrenal medulla, but it only talks about arteries and not nerves. The third document investigates the noradrenergic innervation of the human adrenal cortex, which suggests that there is a nerve supply to the adrenal cortex. The fourth document examines the innervation of the mouse adrenal cortex and finds neural elements present in all zones except the inner zona reticularis. Finally, the fifth document studies the adrenergic innervation of cat adrenal medulla and finds that the norepinephrine cells have a dual innervation, both cholinergic and adrenergic. Based on these findings, we can conclude that there is a nerve supply to the adrenal gland.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
