["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the meaning of square root of pq/n. The relevant documents are about statistical methods for analyzing data. The concept of pq/n seems to be related to dispersion analysis or analysis of variance. The document [A method for performing single-factor dispersion analysis with the transformation of the initial values into relative ones] provides information on how to transform initial values into relative ones, which might be relevant to this question. However, there is no direct mention of square root of pq/n in this document. Therefore, we need to look at other documents.\", \n\"answer_choice\": \"D: Standard error of difference in proportions\"\n}"]
