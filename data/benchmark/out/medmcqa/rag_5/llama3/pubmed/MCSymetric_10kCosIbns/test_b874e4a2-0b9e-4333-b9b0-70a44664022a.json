["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks for an example of anaplerotic reaction. Anaplerotic reactions are those that replenish the pool of important metabolites that are depleted during metabolism. From the provided documents, we can see that pyruvate is a key intermediate in various metabolic pathways. In [Determination of pools of tricarboxylic acid cycle and related acids in bacteria], it is mentioned that pyruvate is one of the metabolic pools determined by the gas chromatographic method. This suggests that pyruvate is an important metabolite. In [Metabolic alkalosis. Relation between bicarbonate load and the behavior of blood lactic acid in the light of the intra-erythrocyte indices of the acid-base balance], it is mentioned that lactate is a fundamental compensation mechanism for rapid buffering of the extra base, implying that lactate is an important metabolite as well.\n\nConsidering the question asks for an example of anaplerotic reaction, we can infer that anaplerotic reactions replenish the pool of these important metabolites. From the provided documents, we can see that pyruvate is an important metabolite, and therefore, it is likely that the reaction from pyruvate to oxaloacetate (A) is an example of anaplerotic reaction.\",\n\"answer_choice\": A"]
