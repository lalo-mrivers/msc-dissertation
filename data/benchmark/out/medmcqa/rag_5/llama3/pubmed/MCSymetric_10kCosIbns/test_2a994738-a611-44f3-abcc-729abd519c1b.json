["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"There are two relevant documents that provide information about benzoyl peroxide. The first document is 'Benzoyl Peroxide Stability in Pharmaceutical Gel Preparations' which states that at both 30 and 40 degrees storage temperatures, benzoyl peroxide was destroyed rapidly (within 1 month) in the presence of certain ingredients. This suggests that benzoyl peroxide is unstable at these temperatures.\n\nThe second document is 'Novel Acrylic Resins for Dental Applications' which does not provide direct information about the temperature at which benzoyl peroxide forms free radicals during polymerization. However, it provides information about the properties of acrylic resins and the conditions under which they are formed.\n\nBased on this information, we can infer that the temperature above which benzoyl peroxide forms free radicals is likely to be higher than 30°C or 40°C since it is stated to be unstable at these temperatures. Therefore, we can rule out options A (25°C), B (37°C) and D (60°C).\n\nThe only option left is C (45°C) which is a possible temperature above which benzoyl peroxide forms free radicals.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
