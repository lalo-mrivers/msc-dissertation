["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the concentration of adrenaline in local anaesthetic solution for achieving haemostasis & vasoconstriction at surgical site. We need to look for relevant information in the documents provided. The first document mentions epinephrine injection with enflurane anesthesia, and it talks about subcutaneous infiltration of adrenaline in lignocaine for haemostasis. It does not mention a specific concentration. However, we can find other references to adrenaline concentrations in other documents. The second document discusses dose limits for local anesthetics, including the technique of administration. It mentions different techniques, such as subcutaneous injection (A), and suggests maximum dose recommendations based on those techniques. The third document talks about adding adrenaline to etidocaine or lignocaine solutions for extradural anaesthesia. Although it does not specifically mention haemostasis or vasoconstriction, it provides information about the effects of adding adrenaline to local anesthetic solutions.\n\nThe fourth document discusses plasma catecholamine levels following topical application versus infiltration of adrenaline for nasal surgery. It compares the concentrations achieved by instillation and submucosal infiltration methods, but does not specifically mention a concentration for haemostasis & vasoconstriction at surgical site. Based on this analysis, we cannot conclude that one specific concentration is recommended for achieving haemostasis & vasoconstriction at surgical site.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
