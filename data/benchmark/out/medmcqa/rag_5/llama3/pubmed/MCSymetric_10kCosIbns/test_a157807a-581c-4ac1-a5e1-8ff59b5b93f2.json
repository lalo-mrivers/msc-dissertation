["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking how to remove centric interference. Centric interference refers to errors that occur when transferring a dental model to an articulator. The relevant document that discusses this topic is [Geometric-mathematical analysis of errors during transfer to the articulator and their practical consequences. II]. According to this paper, vertical deviations depend on the angle of the joint on the balancing side and sagittal position of the model in relation to the condylar axis. Horizontal deviations are independent of articulator sizes. To remove centric interference, one needs to reduce these errors. Therefore, options that address these errors are relevant.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C\n}"]
