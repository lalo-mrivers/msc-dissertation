["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the effects of local anesthetics (LAs) on nerve fibers. Conduction-blocking concentrations of LAs increase with nerve axon diameter: studies with alcohol, lidocaine and tetrodotoxin on single myelinated fibers show that faster conducting fibers require higher blocking concentrations than slower ones. This suggests that smaller myelinated fibers are more sensitive to anesthetic blockade. We can infer that larger fibers would be less susceptible to LA blockade.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B: A alpha\"\n}"]
