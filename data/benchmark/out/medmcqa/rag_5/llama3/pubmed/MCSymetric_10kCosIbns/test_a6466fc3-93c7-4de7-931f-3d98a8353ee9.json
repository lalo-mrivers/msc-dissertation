["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents discuss Ewing's sarcoma, specifically mentioning the translocation (11; 22) (q24; q12). The molecular cytogenetic analysis of a complex t(10;22;11) translocation in Ewing's sarcoma mentions fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) as a method for characterizing this translocation. This suggests that FISH is a suitable method to detect the translocation t(ll;22) in this malignancy.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
