["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking what etching of dentin does NOT include. According to the documents, total etch protocol involves simultaneous etching of dentin and enamel, which helps to create a strong bond between the adhesive resin and the dentin matrix. This process allows for penetration of the resin into the dentinal tubules, facilitating mechanical retention. Etching of dentin is also used to remove the smear layer and permit bonding directly to the dentin matrix. Therefore, etching of dentin does NOT include removal of smear layer.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
