["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant document for this question is 'Acute drug testing with nitrates: angina relief during treadmill exercise.' In this study, sublingual nitroglycerin (N) and chewable isosorbide dinitrate (I) were administered to patients with angina pectoris. Within the I group, four patients experienced the onset of angina relief (AR) at 10 minutes (+/- 3' 4\") with a mean recurrence time (RT) of 154' 3\" (+/- 4' 27\"). Within the N group, six patients had AR of 8' 3\" (+/- 1' 1\") with an RT of 49' 39\" (+/- 1' 15\"). This suggests that I therapy has a longer duration of action than N therapy. Therefore, based on this study, sublingual tablet or sublingual GTN metered dose aerosol usually relieve angina in approximately **10-12 minutes**.\", \"answer_choice\": C}"]
