["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about a dentist who suffered from Hepatitis B infection 3 months back. His laboratory tests are normal, but he is not allowed by the medical board to do surgical practice. We need to determine his carrier status. From the provided documents, we can see that an asymptomatic carrier of HBsAg was found in an oral surgeon who had frequent cuts on his fingers. This suggests that a 'hemoral' transmission of HBs Ag produced hepatitis in his patients. The dentist is not allowed to do surgical practice, which implies that he might be a carrier and could potentially transmit the infection through his work. Considering these points, we can conclude that the dentist is likely an asymptomatic carrier, and this would fit into the category of 'healthy carrier'.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
