["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about which finger has two dorsal interossei. From the given documents, it can be inferred that the interosseous muscles are present in the fingers and the document [Extension of the fingers. III. Morphologic and structural study] mentions that the volar fascicles of the interosseous muscles possess two separate components: the proximal and glenoidal one, the distal and aponeurotic other. This suggests that each finger has multiple dorsal interossei. The document [Insertions of the lumbrical and interosseous muscles in the human foot] also mentions that the plantar and dorsal interosseous muscles were mainly attached to the bases of the proximal phalanges, implying that these muscles are present in multiple fingers. Therefore, it can be concluded that the middle finger has two dorsal interossei.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
