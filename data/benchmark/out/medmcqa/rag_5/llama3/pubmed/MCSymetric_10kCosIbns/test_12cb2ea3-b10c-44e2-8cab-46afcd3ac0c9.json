["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the working time of an impression material. The relevant documents are 'A review of modern impression materials' and 'Elastomeric impression materials: effect of bulk on accuracy'. In 'A review of modern impression materials', it is mentioned that the new addition type silicone impression materials proved superior to the other materials tested, but all materials were capable of giving good clinical results. This does not provide information about the working time of an impression material. On the other hand, in 'Elastomeric impression materials: effect of bulk on accuracy', the text does not explicitly mention the working time of any impression material.\n\nHowever, we can infer that the working time might be related to when the elastic properties of the impression material appear. This is because some impression materials need a certain amount of time to develop their elasticity before they can be used for taking impressions. Based on this inference, option B seems to best describe the working time of an impression material.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
