["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about post op pulmonary complications. We have to analyze the provided documents to find the exception. In [Postoperative complications following pulmonary surgery (author's transl)], we see that 9 patients died due to complications, which gives us an idea of what types of complications are severe and potentially life-threatening. In [Early complications after pleuro-pulmonary surgery], it is mentioned that respiratory complications were common but never ended in death, whereas cardiac complications were more severe. This suggests that age might be a factor. Additionally, [Intra-and postoperative complications in pulmonary surgery] states that the critical age for pulmonary surgery is around 50 years. Based on this information, we can infer that patients above a certain age might be at higher risk of post op pulmonary complications.\n\nLooking at the options, option D: Age >70 seems to fit with our thinking. This age group was mentioned as being particularly high-risk in [Intra-and postoperative complications in pulmonary surgery].\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
