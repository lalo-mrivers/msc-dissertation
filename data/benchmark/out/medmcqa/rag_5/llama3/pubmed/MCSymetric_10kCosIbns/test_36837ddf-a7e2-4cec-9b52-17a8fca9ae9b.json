["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to the provided documents, postdural puncture headache (PDPH) is caused by vascular distension within the nondistensible cranium following the leakage of cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) into the epidural space. To decrease the risk of PDPH, prevention methods such as using small-gauge needles and possibly using the lateral approach can be employed. The study 'Prevention of headache consequent upon dural puncture in obstetric patient' also suggests that either prophylactic treatment with saline injection or abdominal binder can reduce the incidence of post spinal puncture headache. Additionally, another study 'The incidence of post spinal headache in a group of young patients' reports that age modulates the incidence of PDPH and patients older than 30 years have a lower risk of developing PDPH. Therefore, effective strategies to decrease the risk of post puncture dural headache include using small bore needle, prophylactic treatment with saline injection or abdominal binder, and possibly considering the patient's age.\", \"answer_choice\": A}"]
