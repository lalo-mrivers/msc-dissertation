["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking which of the given drugs does not affect DNA synthesis. We need to look at the provided documents for information on each drug's effect on DNA synthesis. From the 'Effects of some polyamines, polyanions and antitumor drugs' document, we see that daunomycin, neocarzinostatin, and bleomycin inhibit replicative DNA synthesis. Aurintricarboxylic acid and heparin also have effects on DNA synthesis. None of these drugs are among the given options. The 'Laboratory and phase I studies of new cancer drugs' document provides information on various antitumor agents, but does not specifically mention DNA synthesis. The 'Experimental results with systematically synthetized substances for antiviral chemotherapy / 4th communication' document discusses the mutagenic activity of some compounds, but is not relevant to this question. The 'The efficiency and extent of mutagenic activity of some new mutagens of base-analogue type' document provides information on the mutagenic properties of some nucleoside analogues, but does not mention any of the given drugs. Finally, the 'The synthesis and anti-neoplastic activity of N2-isobutyryl-2'-deoxyguanosine-N7-cyanoborane derivatives' document discusses the antineoplastic activity of some compounds, but is also not relevant to this question. Therefore, we can conclude that none of the given drugs inhibit DNA synthesis.\",\n\"answer_choice\": A\n}"]
