["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the value of ANB (Angular Relationship between Nasion and Bimaxillary) in a skeletal Class III. The provided documents discuss craniofacial growth and bone age estimation, but there is no direct mention of ANB or its values in relation to skeletal classes. Therefore, we need to rely on general knowledge and principles in the field of orthodontics and physical anthropology. Skeletal Class III is characterized by a posterior crossbite, which can be associated with an increased value of ANB. However, without specific information about the relationship between ANB and skeletal Class III, we must consider possible values based on general trends in craniofacial growth and development. A more positive ANB angle has been linked to a longer face and a larger maxilla, which can be seen in some individuals with a skeletal Class III. Based on this reasoning, the value of ANB in a skeletal Class III could potentially be higher than normal.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
