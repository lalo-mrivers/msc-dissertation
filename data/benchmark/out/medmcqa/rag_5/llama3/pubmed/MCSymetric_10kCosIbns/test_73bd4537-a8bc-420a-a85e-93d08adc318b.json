["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"After reviewing the documents, we can see that myelography is a technique used to visualize the spinal cord. The documents mention different types of contrast media, including water-soluble and oily ones. Since the question asks about expansion of the contrast-filled space in myelography, we should focus on documents related to myelography and its complications. In 'Cervical myelography with a new resorbable contrast medium: Amipaque', it is mentioned that side effects are trivial and no case of epilepsy was observed. However, this does not provide information about the expansion of the contrast-filled space. The same applies to 'A new device for myelography' which describes a new device but does not mention any complications related to the expansion of the contrast-filled space. 'Possible causes of complications of myelography with water-soluble contrast medium' reviews the mechanisms of CSF formation and absorption, which may affect the rate of passage of the contrast medium through the cisterns. However, this document does not provide information about the expansion of the contrast-filled space either. 'Water soluble contrast myelography in spinal canal stenosis and nerve entrapment' illustrates typical cases but does not mention anything about the expansion of the contrast-filled space. Finally, '[Ascending and descending myelography with water-soluble contrast medium]' reports on thoracic and cervical metrizamid-myelography and mentions that metrizamid myelography is superior to air and iodine-oil myelography in respect of clarity of detail. This document does not provide information about the expansion of the contrast-filled space either. Therefore, we should review other documents or search for more information outside these provided documents.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
