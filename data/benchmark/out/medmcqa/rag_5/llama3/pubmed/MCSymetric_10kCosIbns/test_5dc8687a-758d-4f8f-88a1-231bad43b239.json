["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about materials with high compressive strength and low tensile strength. Compressive strength refers to the ability of a material to withstand crushing forces, while tensile strength refers to its ability to withstand stretching or pulling forces. Based on this information, it can be deduced that materials with high compressive strength and low tensile strength are likely to be brittle, as they can withstand pressure well but may break easily under tension.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
