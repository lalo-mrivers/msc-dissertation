["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the characteristics of Vibrio cholerae forms, including their virulence factors. The hemagglutinin/protease (HA/protease) is mentioned as a putative virulence factor that is responsible for detachment of vibrios from cultured human intestinal cells by digestion of several putative receptors for V. cholerae adhesins. There is no information provided about the disruption of specific cell structures by Vibrio cholerae. Therefore, we must look at the possible choices.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
