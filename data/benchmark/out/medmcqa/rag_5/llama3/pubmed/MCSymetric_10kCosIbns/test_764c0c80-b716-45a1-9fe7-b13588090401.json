["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for the central value of a set of 180 values. The term 'central value' suggests that we are looking for a value that is representative of the middle or average of the distribution. This makes me think of measures such as median, mode, and average. However, since there are no modes with 180 values (since each value can only appear once), I am left with the median and average options. The question does not specifically mention whether we want to ignore or consider outliers, so I will assume that the calculation is based on all 180 values.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
