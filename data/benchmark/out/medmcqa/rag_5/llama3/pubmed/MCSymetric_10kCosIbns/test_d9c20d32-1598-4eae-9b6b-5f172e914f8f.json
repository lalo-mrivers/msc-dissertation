["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the function of a 'major connector'. There are several types of connectors described in the documents: Valved-Y-Cardiff Connector (V.Y.C. Con), double-lumen tube connector, and in-line lead connector for use with implanted neuroprosthesis. None of these connectors seem to be related to connecting parts of prosthesis on one side of arch with those on the opposite side. The document about adaptor for coaxial circuits is not relevant to this question either. Therefore, we can safely rule out option A.\n\nThe documents describe various types of connectors that are used to connect different tubes, wires, and vessels. None of these descriptions suggest that they distribute forces across an entire supporting structure, which is the function suggested by option B.\n\nThe remaining two options seem more relevant to the question. The Valved-Y-Cardiff Connector (V.Y.C. Con) prevents retrograde flow into one limb, which can be seen as resisting flexing and torque. Similarly, the in-line lead connector for use with implanted neuroprosthesis provides for replacement of implanted components without disturbing other elements of the implanted system, which can also be seen as resisting flexing and torque.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided in the documents, the function of major connectors seems to be related to resisting flexing and torque (option C).\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
