["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the provided documents, it is clear that dental plaque consists of a dynamic microbiota which responds to ecological changes. The development of bacterial plaque in the oral cavity suggests that the microflora of plaque is complex and shows great individual variation. The concept of microbial specificity in the etiology of periodontal diseases has been widely suggested, implying that different forms of periodontal disease are associated with qualitatively distinct dental plaques. In the development of dental plaque on the incisor teeth of monkeys, the number (log10) of the total colony forming units (c.f.u.) increased significantly from 0.5 to 28 days. Similarly, the number of streptococci increased during the same period, although when expressed as a percentage of the total c.f.u., the proportions decreased from 34.9 per cent at 1 day to 6.9 per cent at 7 days and then remained at that level. This information suggests that primary colonization of plaque is dominated by microorganisms such as streptococci, which are held together in an extracellular matrix partly produced by the organisms and partly derived from saliva.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
