["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, cholinomimetic teratogens are discussed. Cholinomimetics are substances that mimic the action of acetylcholine (ACh) and can cause abnormalities in the development of embryos. The documents also mention parasympathomimetic drugs such as carbachol and neostigmine. In the context of cholinolytics, the term refers to a class of drugs that block the activity of ACh. Cholinomimetics are not directly related to bradycardia (slow heart rate), glaucoma, or post-surgical atony/ileus. Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disorder that affects the neuromuscular junction and is characterized by muscle weakness. It can be treated with cholinesterase inhibitors such as neostigmine. Therefore, based on the provided information, it appears that cholinomimetics are not used in myasthenia gravis.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
