["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the Student t-test. The relevant documents do not mention the Student t-test directly. However, one of the papers mentions a pilot-study aiming at an applicable procedure to select students for schools of medical technicians and used different statistical procedures (correlation, mutiple regression). This suggests that the test is likely related to statistics or data analysis. Another paper discusses multiple-choice testing and its applications in education. This does not provide specific information about the Student t-test. Therefore, we need to rely on general knowledge of statistical tests to answer this question.\", \n\"answer_choice\": \"C: Parametric test based on variance\"\n}"]
