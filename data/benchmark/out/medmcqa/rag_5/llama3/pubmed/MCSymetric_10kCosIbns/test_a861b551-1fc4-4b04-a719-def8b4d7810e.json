["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Since the question asks about the Tweed inclination of lower incisors by 1° labially increases the arch length, we need to look for relevant information in the documents. The document 'Tweed triangle and soft-tissue consideration of Japanese with normal occlusion and good facial profile' provides valuable information about the Tweed triangle. According to this document, the measurements of the Tweed triangle were FMA 27.28 degrees, IMPA 95.50 degrees, and FMIA 57.22 degrees. Since the question asks about the inclination of lower incisors by 1° labially, we need to look for information related to the FMA (Frankfurt Mandibular Plane Angle) which measures the inclination of the lower incisors. According to this document, an FMIA of 57 degrees is suggested as being the most suitable basis for the diagnosis of Japanese patients, but this should be modified according to the FMA value.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
