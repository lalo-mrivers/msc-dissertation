["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question states that a neonate develops encephalitis without any skin lesions. This is reminiscent of the case where Coxsackie B virus infections were acquired in utero and resulted in death. The relevant document also mentions that enterovirus infection was associated with findings of fever, viral meningitis, diarrhea, and rash (41%). Since there are no skin lesions mentioned, I will focus on the possibility of an enteroviral infection. The question does not specify whether the patient is older than 7 days or not, but according to one of the documents, enterovirus was the most common cause of meningitis in neonates older than 7 days and accounted for one third of all cases of neonatal meningitis.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B\n}"]
