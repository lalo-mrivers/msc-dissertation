["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about a 10-year-old with ankle pain and X-ray findings of a lytic lesion with a sclerotic rim at the calcaneum. The patient underwent HPE (histopathological examination) which revealed some findings. We should look for relevant information in the provided documents, specifically those related to ankle anatomy and pathology. We can start by analyzing the document [Anatomy, physiology and pathophysiology of the ankle] where we find that the ankle joint is complex and lesions are frequent due to its anatomy and physiology. Then, we can move on to the other documents which discuss different types of ankle lesions and deformities. The key findings from HPE should guide our diagnosis.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
