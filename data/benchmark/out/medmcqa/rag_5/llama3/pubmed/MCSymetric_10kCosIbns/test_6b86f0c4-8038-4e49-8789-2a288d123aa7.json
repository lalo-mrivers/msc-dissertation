["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"There is no mention of IgA deposits in dermal papilla in the provided documents. However, we can look for clues about where IgA deposits are typically found. In dermatitis herpetiformis, IgA deposits were found in the upper papillary dermis forming irregular aggregates associated with microfibrillar bundles and anchoring fibrils, but not on the basal lamina.
