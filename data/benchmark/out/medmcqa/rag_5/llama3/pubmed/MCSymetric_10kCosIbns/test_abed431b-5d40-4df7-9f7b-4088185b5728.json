["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, specifically the paper 'Transplantation to the diseased and damaged retina' which mentions RCS dystrophic rats losing photoreceptor cells as a result of defective retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells. This suggests that RPE cells are crucial for photoreceptor-cell survival and development. Additionally, in the process of wound healing of the avascular outer layers of the retina, bi- or multinucleate cells with additional nuclei situated in apical cytoplasmic protrusions which extend towards and into the lesions are observed. These cells appear to arise through the off-budding of the nucleus-containing apical protrusions of the pigment epithelial cells around the lesions.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
