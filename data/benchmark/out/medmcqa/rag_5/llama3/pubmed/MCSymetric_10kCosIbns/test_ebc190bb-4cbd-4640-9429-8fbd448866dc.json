["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents are about hypertension during pregnancy. There is no specific mention of the term 'systemic hypeension'. However, we can infer that it refers to hypertension diagnosed at a certain stage of gestation, possibly in relation to prediction or prevention of hypertension syndrome of pregnancy (HSP).
