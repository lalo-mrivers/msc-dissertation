["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The recommended daily intake of iodine in pregnancy is not explicitly mentioned in the provided documents. However, we can infer that the optimal range for iodine concentration in urine specimens from boys and girls aged 6-18 years was found to be 10-20 micrograms/dl.
