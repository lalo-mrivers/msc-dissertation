["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents describe apoproteins as proteins that are associated with lipids to form lipoproteins. Apo A-I, apo C-III, and apo E were found to be present in human atherosclerotic arteries, suggesting possible roles in the pathogenesis and regression of the atherosclerotic process. Secretion of lipid-poor nascent apolipoproteins by cell clones expressing the corresponding genes indicates that these proteins can associate extracellularly with preexisting lipoproteins. Additionally, Lp(a) contains an additional apolipoprotein called apo(a), which exhibits a significant size polymorphism and its size is inversely correlated with plasma Lp(a) levels. From this information, it appears that apoproteins play a role in the structure and function of lipoproteins.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
