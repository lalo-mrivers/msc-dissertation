["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents mention the sex differences in fetal sheep adrenal steroidogenesis. The formation of several steroids was determined in vitro in adrenals removed from 18 female and six male fetuses. Samples were incubated with 14C-acetate and the formation of labeled steroids was determined by two-dimensional paper chromatography. Corticosterone concentrations were determined by chromophore absorption and acid hydrolysis fluorescence methods, respectively. Tissue corticosterone concentrations were significantly higher in female than in male adrenal tissue. Both testosterone and estradiol were synthesized at higher rates in female than in male adrenals.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
