["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Comparing the documents, it is clear that cholesterol has different forms such as free cholesterol, lipoproteins, and esters. The enzymatic assays described in the documents use cholesterol oxidase to measure total cholesterol or free cholesterol. This suggests that physiological active form of cholesterol can be one of these forms. However, the modulation of membrane function by cholesterol suggests that high levels of cholesterol in the membrane can affect protein function. This implies that a specific sterol is required for cell viability, which could be related to the physiological active form of cholesterol.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
