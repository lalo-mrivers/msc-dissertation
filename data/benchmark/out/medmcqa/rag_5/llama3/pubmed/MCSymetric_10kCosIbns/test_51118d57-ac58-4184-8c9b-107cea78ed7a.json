["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents discuss tooth morphogenesis, which is categorized into three phases: Phase I: Initiating events; Phase II: Histogenetic events; and Phase III: Cytodifferentiative events. The early innervation of the developing deciduous teeth also plays a role in initiating tooth development. Silver staining of embryonic mouse tissue supports the notion that the innervation is present before tooth buds appear. Considering these facts, it can be inferred that initial tooth development begins during Phase I, which corresponds to the 4th week of embryonic development.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
