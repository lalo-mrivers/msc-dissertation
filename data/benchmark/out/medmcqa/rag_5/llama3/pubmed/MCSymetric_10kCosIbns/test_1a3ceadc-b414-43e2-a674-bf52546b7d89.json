["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents provided describe the effects of various antibiotics on DNA. Some antibiotics, such as netropsin and Hoechst 33258, alter the electrophoretic mobility of DNA restriction fragments. Other antibiotics, like minocycline, oxytetracycline, and tetracycline, suppress DNA synthesis in human lymphocytes. None of the documents mention Metronidazole, Nystatin, or Sulphonamides specifically affecting DNA function. Therefore, we can conclude that an antibiotic that interferes with DNA function is not among these options.\", \"answer_choice\": C}"]
