["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents provide information about the auditory pathway from peripheral to central. The cochlear nucleus is mentioned as one of the levels where afferent impulsation was compared, and it's stated that the number of neurons describing the temporal structure of the amplitude-modulated signal's envelope in the impulse activity pattern becomes sharply reduced. The medial geniculate body is also mentioned as the last relay before the cerebral cortex. According to the document [Coding of the acoustic information in the superior auditory centers], the place code shows the same properties as in lower centers but with a greater diversity in the response patterns and tuning properties. This suggests that the medial geniculate body is a higher level in the auditory pathway than the cochlear nucleus. The inferior colliculus is not mentioned as a specific level, but it's mentioned as part of the subcortical nuclei that are responsible for extracting features of sound location. The auditory coex is mentioned as one of the centers where an active inhibition underlying the diverse response patterns observed.\n\nConsidering this information, we can conclude that the sequence from peripheral to central is: Cochlear nucleus > Inferior colliculus > Medial geniculate body > Auditory cortex.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
