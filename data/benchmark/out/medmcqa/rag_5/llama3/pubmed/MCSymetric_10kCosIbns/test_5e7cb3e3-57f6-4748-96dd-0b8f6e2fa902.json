["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks what is true regarding tonsillectomy in children except. The provided documents discuss various aspects of tonsillectomy in childhood. According to the paper 'Tonsillectomy in childhood: personal considerations', obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) has recently emerged as an increasingly important factor in indicating tonsillectomy and/or adenotonsillectomy. This suggests that sleep apnea is indeed an indication for tonsillectomy in children. The document 'Technique of general anesthesia for tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy' discusses the technique used for inducing anesthesia, which does not provide any information contradicting OSA as an indication.\n\nThe paper 'Status of tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy: 1977' provides a brief overview of the current status of knowledge concerning tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy. This document does not explicitly discuss indications for tonsillectomy in children, but it does mention that obstructive sleep apnea may be encountered during surgery.\n\nThe paper 'Tonsillectomy in Manitoba: who are the patients? the surgeons? the hospitals?' discusses the current situation of tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy rates in Manitoba. This document provides some information about the indications for tonsillectomy, but it does not contradict OSA as an indication.\n\nIn conclusion, all available information from the provided documents suggests that sleep apnea is indeed an indication for tonsillectomy in children. Therefore, option B should be chosen.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
