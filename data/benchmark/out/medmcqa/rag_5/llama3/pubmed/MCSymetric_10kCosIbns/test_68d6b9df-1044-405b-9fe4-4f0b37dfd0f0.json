["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, we can analyze the ionization of amino acids at physiological pH. From the document 'Preferential hydrophobic interactions are responsible for a preference of D-amino acids in the aminoacylation of 5'-AMP with hydrophobic amino acids', we know that amino acids have different ionization properties. For example, arginine is mentioned as having a transport system for basic amino acids. From the document '[Ionization of the acid-base groups of polyene antibiotics in aqueous solutions]', we see that the ionization constants of the carboxylic and amine groups of polyenic antibiotics were determined. This suggests that different amino acids have different pKa values, which affect their charge at physiological pH. Based on this information, we can deduce that certain amino acids will have a positive charge at physiological pH.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
