["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Nitroglycerin is a vasodilating agent that acts on vascular smooth muscle fibers. It has been shown to decrease total systemic resistance (TSR) and total pulmonary resistance (TPR), while increasing cardiac output (CO), stroke volume (SV), and heart rate (HR). This suggests that its main action is on smooth muscle, which is supported by the text stating it has a direct vasodilating action on both venous and arterial smooth muscle fibers.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
