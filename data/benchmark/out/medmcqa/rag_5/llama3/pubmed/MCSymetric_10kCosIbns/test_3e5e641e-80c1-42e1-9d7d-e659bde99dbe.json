["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks for the rapid source of energy by resynthesizing ATP for exercising muscles. The relevant documents mention that during intense exercise, phosphocreatine (PCr) is depleted rapidly and anaerobically utilized to fuel muscle contraction. Additionally, ATP stores are continually resynthesized, with this process being achieved primarily by the oxidation of carbohydrate and the anaerobic utilization of PCr and carbohydrate.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
