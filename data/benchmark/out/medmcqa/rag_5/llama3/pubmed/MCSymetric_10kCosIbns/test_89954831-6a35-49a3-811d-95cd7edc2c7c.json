["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"After a point mutation, glutamic acid is replaced by valine, which leads to the formation of sickle cell hemoglobin (HbS). This substitution changes the charge of the protein, resulting in altered electrophoretic mobility. Since valine has a smaller charge than glutamic acid, HbS would have a reduced mobility compared to normal hemoglobin.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
