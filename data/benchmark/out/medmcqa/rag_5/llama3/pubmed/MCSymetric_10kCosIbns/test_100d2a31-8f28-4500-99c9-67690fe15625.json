["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about ganglionic transmission, which involves the release of neurotransmitters from preganglionic fibers onto postganglionic neurons. The provided documents describe the receptors involved in this process. In the 'Regulation of the M current' document, it is mentioned that slow excitatory postsynaptic potentials in sympathetic ganglia often involve suppression of a voltage-dependent potassium current termed the M current. This current is suppressed by the muscarinic action of acetylcholine, indicating the presence of muscarinic receptors on postganglionic neurons. Additionally, the 'Involvement of nicotinic and muscarinic receptors' document states that contractions of the nictitating membrane and postganglionic action potentials evoked by electrical stimulation of the vagal artificial preganglionic trunk were blocked by treatment with atropine, suggesting the presence of muscarinic receptors. Therefore, postsynaptic nicotinic and muscarinic receptors are involved in ganglionic transmission.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
