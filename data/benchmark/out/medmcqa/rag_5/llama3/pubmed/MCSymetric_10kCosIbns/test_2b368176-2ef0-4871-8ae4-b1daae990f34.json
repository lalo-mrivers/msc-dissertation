["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, apical root canal anatomy in dogs can be described as a 'sprinkler-rose' anatomy: at the tip of the pulpal canal, the canal is divided in numerous narrow channels radiating peripherally through the dentin and the cementum and ending in numerous apical foramina on the cementum surface. This architecture constitutes a very complex apical delta. Accessory canals are not mentioned as being most numerous in the apical third. Instead, they appear in the gaps of the epithelial root sheaths formed by their approaching each other in the initial stage of the root formation, and also in the slits which may be formed by the destruction of the epithelial root sheath in the root apex regions. This information suggests that accessory canals are more numerous in the middle or coronal thirds rather than the apical third.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
