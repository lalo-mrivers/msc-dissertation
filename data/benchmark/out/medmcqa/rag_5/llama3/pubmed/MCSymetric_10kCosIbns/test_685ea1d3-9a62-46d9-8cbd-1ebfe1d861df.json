["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the ultrastructure and functions of the periodontal ligament. The predominant cellular element consists of fibroblasts and fibrocytes which are responsible for collagen synthesis and destruction. The presence of microfilaments, microtubules, and tight junctions suggests that these cells are contractile and motile. The structure of the ligament includes bundles of collagen fibrils and oxytalan fibers. The function of the periodontal ligament is to cushion the tooth during mastication while sheltering delicate cells that remodel the bony socket. The rapid turnover of major components is a unique feature of this tissue.\", \"answer_choice\": C}"]
