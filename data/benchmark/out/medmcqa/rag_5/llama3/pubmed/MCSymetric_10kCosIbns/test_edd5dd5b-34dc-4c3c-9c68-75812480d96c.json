["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to the documents, occlusal interferences are discussed in several studies. The document 'Discussion of the effect of occlusal factor on bruxism' specifically states that occlusal interferences exist in both patient and control groups, but most subjects can compensate for these without feeling discomfort.
