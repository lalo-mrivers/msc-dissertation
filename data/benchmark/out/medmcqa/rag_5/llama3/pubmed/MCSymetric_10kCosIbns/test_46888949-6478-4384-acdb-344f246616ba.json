["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, none of them explicitly discuss Bond found in GIC (Glass Ionomer Cement). Therefore, it is necessary to consider the general principles of bonding systems discussed in these papers. All-Bond system is a universal bonding system that allows for bonding composite to all dental-related surfaces, including dentin, enamel, metal alloy, and others. The documents do not provide information about the chemical composition or properties of GIC. However, considering the types of bonds mentioned in the papers, such as covalent, ionic, hydrogen, and metallic, it is possible that GIC may form a type of bond with the surrounding material. As the documents are primarily focused on dental adhesives and bonding systems, it seems more likely that GIC would form an ionic or covalent bond.\", \"answer_choice\": C}"]
