["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, it is clear that the mesonephros is a developmental organ in the chick embryo. The number of nephron populations in the postinduction period was established in 6- and 8-days chicken embryos, showing that there are different layers of nephrons along the length of the kidney. The development of mesonephros was accompanied by an increase in the absolute length of the nephrons of all populations and their segments. This suggests that the mesonephros is a complex organ with multiple functional units. Additionally, the documents mention the presence of glomeruli and tubules in the juxtagonadal region in fetuses ranging from 11 to 21 weeks of gestation, indicating that the mesonephros has a functional component.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
