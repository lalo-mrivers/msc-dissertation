["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to the documents provided, HDL is a discoidal particle comprising phospholipid, cholesteryl esters, and several apolipoproteins. The composition of high density lipoprotein (HDL) subfractions was investigated in seven normal individuals. Mean HDL2 composition was 43% protein, 28% phospholipid, 23% cholesterol, and 6% triglyceride. The mean apoA-I; apoA-II weight ratio was 4.75 for HDL2. Therefore, it can be inferred that apoproteins are maximum in HDL compared to other lipoproteins.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
