["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the most common chances of pulpal exposure when the pulpal floor is made perpendicular to the long axis of tooth. We need to look for documents that discuss pulpal exposure or pulpal trauma. One document mentions the preparation trauma of the pulp and its reactive behavior, which could be relevant.
