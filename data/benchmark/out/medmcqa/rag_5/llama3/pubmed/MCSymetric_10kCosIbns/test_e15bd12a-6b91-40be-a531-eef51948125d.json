["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the effects of ionizing radiation on biological processes. The documents highlight that changes of circulation and rheological properties of blood occurring in exposure to ionizing radiation depend directly on the irradiation dose. Additionally, damage to DNA is mentioned as the principal target for cell death, loss of reproductive integrity, mutation, cancer, developmental anomalies, and other radiobiological effects. This suggests that the effect of radiation is dependent on various factors such as dose, dose rate, radiation quality, biological modifiers, etc.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
