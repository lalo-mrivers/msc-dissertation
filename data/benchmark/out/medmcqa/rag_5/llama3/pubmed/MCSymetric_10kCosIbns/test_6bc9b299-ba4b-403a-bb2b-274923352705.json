["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to the documents, we can see that cholesterol crystals are found in the atheromatous arterial walls (Liquid cholesterol crystals, physical substrate of atheroma). Specifically, they are present in the intima under the form of liquid crystals. This is further supported by the fact that these crystals turn to liquid globules above 40 degrees centigrad and partially reappear under the action of the cold. Additionally, we can see that needle-like or quadrate 'crystals' (which seem to be similar to cholesterol crystals) are found in the biopsy specimens of liver lesions (Cytoplasmic crystals (cholesterol?) in acute and chronic liver lesions. Electron microscopic study). Therefore, the answer is not related to infection, contamination, irritation, or stimulation.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A: Zone of intima\"\n}"]
