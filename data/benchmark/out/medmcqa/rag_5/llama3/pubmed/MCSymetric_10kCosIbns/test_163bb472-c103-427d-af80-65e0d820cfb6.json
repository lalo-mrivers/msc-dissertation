["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents describe the role of Hox genes in pattern formation, particularly in the specification of regional diversity. Abnormalities in Hox gene structure and expression are likely to be implicated in specific human congenital malformation syndromes. The documents also mention that alterations in HOX gene expression can lead to tumorigenesis. There is no direct evidence presented for a specific malformation, but the dramatic advances in developmental genetics emphasize the considerable similarity in the primary processes and molecules used to guide early morphogenesis in all species.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
