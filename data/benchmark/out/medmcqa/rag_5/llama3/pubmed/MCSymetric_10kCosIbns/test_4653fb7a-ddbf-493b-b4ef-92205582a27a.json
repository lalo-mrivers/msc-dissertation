["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking which tooth does not have 5 cusps. The given documents mention various types of molars, but they do not provide a specific count of cusps for each tooth. However, the document about cusp and cusp size reduction in second molars provides information on the morphology of different molar teeth. According to this document, maxillary molars have 4-5 cusps, while mandibular molars have 3-4 cusps. This suggests that not all molars have 5 cusps. Considering the possible choices provided, we can deduce that Mandibular 2nd Molar has 3-4 cusps, and therefore it is not having 5 cusps.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
