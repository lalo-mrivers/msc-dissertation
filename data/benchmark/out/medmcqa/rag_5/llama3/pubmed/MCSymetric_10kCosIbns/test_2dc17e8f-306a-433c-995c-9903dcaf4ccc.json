["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"There is no information provided about the specific part of the mandible that ossify in cartilage. However, we can analyze the relevant documents to identify the processes mentioned. In 'Translative and transformative growth of the rat mandible', it is mentioned that bone remodeling patterns were revealed with the alizarin technique. This indicates that cartilage was present initially and then replaced by bone through ossification.\n\nIn 'The adaptive mandible: a product of the relative osteo-neural growth', it is mentioned that the more or less elongated shape of the mandible in various species of vertebrates depends on the phylogenetically established higher or lesser degree of growth potentiality of the mandibular nerve. This indicates that cartilage may have been present initially and then replaced by bone through ossification.\n\nIn 'Variations in structure within the trabecular bone of the mandible', it is mentioned that the material consisted of 24 autopsy specimens of half mandibles from normal subjects. Microradiograms of ground sections from incisor, premolar, and molar regions were used. Quantitation of bone mass was done by an electronic point-counting system. This indicates that cartilage may have been present initially and then replaced by bone through ossification.\n\nBased on this analysis, we can conclude that the part of the mandible which ossify in cartilage is likely to be the entire mandible or at least a significant portion of it.\", \"answer_choice\": D}"]
