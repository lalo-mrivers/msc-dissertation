["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"There is no direct information provided about the location of MB2 (mesiobuccal root canal) in maxillary first molars. However, we can infer some information from Part II: Internal anatomy of the Morphologic study of the maxillary molars. It states that 75% of the first molars presented three root canals and 25% presented four root canals. Since MB2 is a common mesiobuccal root canal found in most maxillary first molars, it's likely to be located between the two other root canals (mesiopalatal and distobuccal) or possibly in one of the canals with some degree of branching.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
