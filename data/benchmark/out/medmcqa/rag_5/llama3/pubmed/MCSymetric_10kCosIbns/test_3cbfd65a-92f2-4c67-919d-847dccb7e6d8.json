["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the number of teeth selected for scoring of PHP-M (Personal Hygiene Performance Modified). The relevant documents do not mention PHP-M or Personal Hygiene Performance Modified. However, we can look at the document titled 'An oral hygiene measurement system for possible research and clinical use.' This document describes a new hygiene index that scores tooth surfaces as clean (0) or dirty (1), determining a percentage of \"dirty\" surfaces which then becomes the Hygiene Analysis Index. This suggests that individual teeth are scored, not groups of teeth. Therefore, we can infer that a smaller number of teeth is selected for scoring.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
