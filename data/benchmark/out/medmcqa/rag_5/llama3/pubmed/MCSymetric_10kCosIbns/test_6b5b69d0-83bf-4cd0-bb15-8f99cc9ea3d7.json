["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking which hormone increases the sensitivity of heart to epinephrine. From the provided documents, none of the options (A: Parathyroid, B: Insulin, C: Thyroid, D: Glucagon) directly relate to the effect of epinephrine on heart sensitivity. However, we can infer that Glucagon might be a possible answer based on its effects on glucose metabolism and glycolysis. Epinephrine is known to enhance glycolysis by increasing glucose 1,6-bisphosphate (G-1,6-P2), fructose 6-phosphate-, and F-1,6-P2-mediated activation of PFK. Glucagon is also known to increase glucose utilization and stimulate glycogenolysis. Therefore, it's possible that glucagon might increase the sensitivity of heart to epinephrine by enhancing glycolytic pathways.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: Glucagon\"\n}"]
