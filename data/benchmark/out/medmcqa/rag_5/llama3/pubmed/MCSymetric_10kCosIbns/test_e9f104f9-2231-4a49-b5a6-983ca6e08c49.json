["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about a pier abutment. I will analyze the relevant documents. The document 'Optimization of inlay care: pin anchorage' does not seem to be related to pier abutments. The documents 'Anatomical considerations when using endodontic endosseous pins and blade implants', 'Tool marks in bones and cartilage', and '[Ender nailing--an attempt at determining the position]' do not mention pier abutments either. The document 'How to extract an indwelling fishhook' also does not provide any information about pier abutments.\n\nThe only relevant information is that pier abutment is a type of dental restoration, which is mentioned in none of the provided documents. Therefore, I will base my answer on general knowledge and experience in dentistry. A pier abutment is typically defined as an abutment adjacent to edentulous space (edentulous means toothless). This definition matches option D: Abutment adjacent to edentulous space.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
