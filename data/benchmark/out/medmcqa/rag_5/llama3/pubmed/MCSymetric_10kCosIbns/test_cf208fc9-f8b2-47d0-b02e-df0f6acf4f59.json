["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents mention the nerve supply of the pulp. In 'Fine tissue studies of the nerve supply to the dental pulp in domestic sheep', it is stated that the pulp is supplied with myelinated and unmyelinated nerve fibres. This information suggests that the nerve fibres are autonomic, as there is no mention of motor or sensory functions. The study also mentions the absence of a subodontoblastic plexus of Raschkow in sheep, which implies that these nerve fibres are not part of a parasympathetic system. Therefore, it can be inferred that the nerve fibres in pulp are sympathetic efferent post-ganglionic.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
