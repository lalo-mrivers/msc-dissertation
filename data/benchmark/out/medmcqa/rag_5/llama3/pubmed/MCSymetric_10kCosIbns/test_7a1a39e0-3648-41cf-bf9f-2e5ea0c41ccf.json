["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents discuss the treatment of fractured edentulous mandibles. The study on fractures of the edentulous mandible highlights the importance of anatomical alignment and the risk of nonunion if this is not achieved. Closed reduction is advocated for atrophic mandibular bodies, as it may preclude nonunion and a prolonged clinical course. Another document discusses the treatment of fractured jaws, including conservative and operative measures for fractures of the mandible. It highlights the importance of anatomical and functional restoration of the broken mandible and the middle part of the face. Based on this information, bone grafting is mentioned as an option for reconstruction following fracture in atrophic mandibles. The document also suggests that wire mesh is preferable to bone plates for stability.\n\nConsidering these points, it seems that bone grafting could be a suitable treatment modality for fracture of atrophic mandible with bone loss. However, the choice between load bearing and load sharing would depend on various factors, such as the extent of the bone loss and the patient's systemic condition.\n\nIn terms of the options provided, option B: Bone grafting and load sharing seems to be the most relevant and logical approach.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
