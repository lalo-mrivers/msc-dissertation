["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the proximal walls of a class II cavity on a deciduous molar. Since there are no relevant documents provided for deciduous molars, I will focus on the anatomy of the first mandibular molar in dogs. The studies suggest that the furcation area has a complex anatomy, and the tooth size does not have a significant effect on the furcation entrance measurement. Additionally, the root surface area measurements were taken from 20 first mandibular molar teeth obtained randomly from canine cadaver specimens.\n\nBased on these studies, I will consider the shape of the crown of the deciduous molar as it is described in [Studies on the thickness of the hard tissue coating in the 1st upper deciduous molars with special reference to the shape of the crown]. The report suggests that the measurements were made by means of a stereomicroscope SM XX number 551 190 (VEB Carl Zeiss, Jena), and the results were statistically evaluated.\n\nGiven this information, I will analyze the potential attachment area of the first mandibular molar in dogs. Tooth root and root trunk surface area measurements were taken from 20 first mandibular molar teeth obtained randomly from canine cadaver specimens. The mean root surface area for all teeth was 497.1 +/- 116.2 mm2.\n\nIn light of this information, I will consider the organic content in occlusal groove-fossa-system in unerupted 3rd mandibular molars: a light and electron microscopic study. A method is described by means of which organic content in fissure areas of 12 unerupted 3rd mandibular molars can be prepared for studies in the light microscope (LM) and in the transmission electron microscope (TEM).\n\nFinally, I will consider the new concept regarding the origin of the junctional and crevicular epithelium in rat molars. The substitution of the internal enamel epithelium by a squamous epithelium during tooth eruption has been studied histologically in rat molars.\n\nConsidering all this information, I will analyze the question about the proximal walls of a class II cavity on a deciduous molar. Since there is no specific information provided for deciduous molars, I will focus on the general anatomy and characteristics of teeth.\n\nBased on my analysis, I believe that the shape of the crown of the deciduous molar suggests that the enamel rods are not significantly affected by the presence of a class II cavity, which means that they do not converge or diverge towards the occlusal surface. Instead, the enamel rods would follow their natural direction.\n\nThe question also asks about the thickness of the hard tissue coating on the 1st upper deciduous molars with special reference to the shape of the crown. This information suggests that the hard substance coating is relatively thick and does not significantly affect the enamel rods.\n\nFinally, the studies suggest that the root surface area measurements were taken from 20 first mandibular molar teeth obtained randomly from canine cadaver specimens. This information does not provide any specific insights into the anatomy of deciduous molars.\n\nBased on my analysis, I conclude that the proximal walls of a class II cavity on a deciduous molar follow directions of enamel rods (A).\",\n\"answer_choice\": A"]
