["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, it is mentioned that initial axonal degeneration in the pulp of deciduous teeth can be found already in the pulp of deciduous molars of children about the age of four till five. This suggests that the process of root resorption and calcification starts early on. Additionally, the study on microscopical aspects of root resorption of human deciduous teeth mentions that the pulp of the deciduous tooth might be cementogenic in some way, given that about 13% of the samples were found to be so. This implies that there is a possibility for calcification to occur during this stage. Given these findings, it can be inferred that calcification of roots of deciduous teeth starts around the age of four and is completed by the age of six.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
