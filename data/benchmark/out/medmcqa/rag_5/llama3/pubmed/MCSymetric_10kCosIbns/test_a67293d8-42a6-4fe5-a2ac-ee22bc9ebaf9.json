["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the part of a rod where acid dissolution is most common. The relevant information is found in the document 'Dissolution of ionizable drugs into unbuffered solution: a comprehensive model for mass transport and reaction in the rotating disk geometry'. According to this document, the model includes the effects of diffusion, convection, and simultaneous acid/base reaction at all points in the region adjacent to the dissolving solid. This suggests that acid dissolution is not limited to a specific part of the rod.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
