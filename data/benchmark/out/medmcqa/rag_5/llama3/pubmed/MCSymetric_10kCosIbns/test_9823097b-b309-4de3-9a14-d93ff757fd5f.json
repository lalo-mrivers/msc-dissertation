["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about a reflex that never disappears. I will analyze each option to see if it refers to a permanent reflex. Option A, walking and stepping reflex, is a voluntary movement and can be interrupted or suppressed. Option B, limb placement reflex, is also not a permanent reflex as it can be affected by various factors such as muscle fatigue or cognitive load. Option C, parachute reflex, does not seem to be a real reflex in the context of human physiology. Therefore, I will focus on the remaining options. The text does not mention any reflex related to oculomotor adaptation to prisms, ocular proprioception, efference copy, or eye closure and acoustic reflex threshold.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
