["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, we need to find the rate constant (kcat) for the reaction. Since the substrate concentration is 1000 times the Km value of the enzyme, we can assume that the reaction is diffusion-limited and thus maximal. This means that the kcat value will be approximately 10^10-10^11 times the ambient substrate concentration.\n\nNext, we need to find the time taken for the initial 17% of substrate (12 microgram/ml) to be converted into product. Since the enzyme concentration is changed to 1/3 and the substrate concentration is doubled, we can assume that the kcat value remains constant.\n\nFinally, to find the time taken to convert the same amount of substrate into product (i.e., 12 microgram/ml), we need to divide the initial time by the ratio of the new enzyme concentration to the old one.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
