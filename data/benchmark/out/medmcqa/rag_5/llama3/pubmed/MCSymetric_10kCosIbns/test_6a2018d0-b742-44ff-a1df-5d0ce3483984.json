["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for the sensitivity and specificity of a latex agglutination test. The table provided shows the results of the test as follows: Test Positive = Diseased + 273, Non-diseased = 595. To calculate the sensitivity, we need to find the number of true positives (diseased who tested positive) and divide it by the total number of diseased individuals. Similarly, for specificity, we need to find the number of true negatives (non-diseased who tested negative) and divide it by the total number of non-diseased individuals.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
