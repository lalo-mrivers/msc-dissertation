["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe various techniques for reconstructing mandibles, including inferior border grafting and implants. The importance of the bony technique is highlighted in the article 'Radiologic follow-up of bone transplants to bridge mandibular continuity defects'. This suggests that the boning technique plays a significant role in determining marginal bone loss around mandibular implant. However, there is no direct evidence linking abutment, connector or implant fixture to marginal bone loss. Therefore, it can be inferred that these factors are not directly responsible for marginal bone loss.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
