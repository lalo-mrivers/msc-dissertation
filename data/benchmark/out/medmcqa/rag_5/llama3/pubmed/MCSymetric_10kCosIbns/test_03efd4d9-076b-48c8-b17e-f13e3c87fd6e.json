["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about delayed eruption of at least part of the dentition. Rickets is a condition known to cause delayed dental development (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK4702/). Congenital hyperthyroidism does not seem to be related to dental development based on the provided documents. Cleidocranial dysplasia and Cherubism are both genetic conditions that affect the development of the dentition, as described in the document 'Dental variation among populations'. Therefore, we can conclude that delayed eruption is a feature of all the above mentioned conditions except for Congenital hyperthyroidism.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
