["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has carcinoma of the larynx involving the left false cords, left arytenoid, and the left aryepiglottic folds. This indicates a tumor location outside the vocal cords. The relevant document on Adenoid-cystic carcinoma of the larynx suggests that these tumors grow under an intact mucosa and can reach enormous extension until dyspnoea, dysphagia, and recurrent nerve paresis lead to diagnosis. The clinical course is not predictable even by their histological structure.\n\nThe relevant document on Surgery of cancer of the larynx highlights the importance of radical surgery in achieving better results.\n\nThe patient has bilateral mobile true cords, indicating that the tumor does not involve the vocal cords. This suggests that a partial hemilaryngectomy (either vertical or horizontal) may be possible.\n\nHowever, the tumor location outside the vocal cords and the unpredictable clinical course suggest that a total laryngectomy could also be considered as a treatment option.\n\nRadiotherapy followed by chemotherapy is not specifically mentioned in the relevant documents as a treatment option for adenoid-cystic carcinoma of the larynx.\", \n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
