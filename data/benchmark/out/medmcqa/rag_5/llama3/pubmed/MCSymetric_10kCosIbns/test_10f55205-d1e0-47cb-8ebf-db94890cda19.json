["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the composition of a square knot. From the provided documents, we can see that square knots are discussed in multiple studies. One study mentions that 1 x 1 x 1 x 1 knots and 1 = 1 = 1 = 1 knots are optimal, regardless of thread structure. Another study discusses different types of sutures and knotting techniques, including the square or reef knot. We can infer that a square knot is composed of two loops, as it is described as a 'reef' knot in one study. The direction of throwing the loops is not specified in the provided documents, so we cannot determine this from the given information.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
