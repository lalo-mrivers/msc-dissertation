["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks for the highest incidence of atypical root canal or root among all teeth. We can infer that 'atypical' refers to variations in root canal anatomy. We have three documents that describe such variations: 1) Variations in root canal anatomy, which mentions that some roots are extremely short; 2) Frequency and most common localisation of root canal curvature, which highlights the frequency of curved canals; 3) The incidence of mandibular premolars with more than one root canal in a Turkish population, which shows that 27.76% of mandibular premolars have multiple canals. From these documents, we can deduce that atypical root canal or root is most commonly seen in mandibular premolars.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
