["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the layers of epidermis from surface to deep layer. The given options are: Corneocytes, Merkel cells, Melanocytes, Langerhans cells. We can analyze each option and compare it with the provided documents.\\nFrom the document 'Surface ultrastructure of human skin', we know that corneocytes are the horny cells on the surface of the epidermis. \\nFrom the document 'Embryology of the epidermis: ultrastructural aspects', we know that Merkel cells are present in the 11-day embryo as peridermal cells.\\nMelanocytes and Langerhans cells are immune cells, which are deeper layers in the epidermis.\\nTherefore, based on these documents, we can conclude that Corneocytes is the surface layer and Merkel cells, Melanocytes, and Langerhans cells are deeper layers.\\nThe correct answer is option D: corneocytes>>langerhans cells>melanocytes > merkel cells.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
