["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the given documents, we can see that CMV infection can cause various symptoms such as microcephaly, hepatomegaly, and periventricular calcification. In the document 'Surveillance of congenital cytomegalovirus disease', it is mentioned that one of the most frequent laboratory abnormalities was low platelet count, which was observed in 52% of the cases. This suggests that CMV infection can affect various organs including the liver and brain. In the document 'Cytomegalovirus encephalitis in a non-immunocompromised patient: CSF diagnosis by in situ hybridization cells', it is mentioned that CMV encephalitis was diagnosed using viral DNA probe techniques on CSF cells. This suggests that CSF can be used as a site for specimen collection for diagnosing CMV infection. However, given the symptoms presented (microcephaly and periventricular calcification), it is more likely that the diagnosis would involve brain tissue or fluid. Therefore, the best site from where a specimen should be obtained for diagnosis of CMV by PCR would be CSF.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
