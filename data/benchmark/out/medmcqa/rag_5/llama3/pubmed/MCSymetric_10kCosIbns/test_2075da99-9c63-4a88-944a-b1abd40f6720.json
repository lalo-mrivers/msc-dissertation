["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to the documents, vitamin K is involved in post-translational carboxylation of specific glutamate residues to gamma-carboxyglutamate (Gla) residues. It also functions as a co-factor for the carboxylation of several blood coagulation factors (II, VII, IX and X) and coagulation inhibitors (proteins C and S). This highlights its importance in blood clotting. Prothrombin (factor II) is one of these clotting factors, which suggests that vitamin K plays a role in the formation of prothrombin.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
