["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the type of failure that may occur when the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) of a ceramic is much lower than that of metal. This suggests that there might be differences in the way both materials respond to temperature changes. We can look at various documents related to bioceramics, casting processes, and thermal cycling distortion. The document 'Thermal cycling distortion of metal ceramics: Part II--Etiology' specifically discusses the effects of CTE on deformation. It mentions that all significant distortion occurred during the first thermal cycling (oxidation) and that no distortion resulted from the application of body porcelain. This implies that differences in CTE can lead to stress build-up and potential failure. Considering the document 'Thermodifferential analysis of ceramic implants', we know that bioceramics like alumina ceramics have a low CTE. Comparing this with metals having a higher CTE, it's likely that when both materials are bonded together, differences in their thermal expansion can lead to stress and potentially failure.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
