["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks which cell releases vasoactive amine to increase vascular permeability. We need to find the relevant information from the provided documents. The document '[Endothelial mediators regulating vascular tonus]' mentions that endothelium-derived relaxation factors (EDRF) have a vasodilator effect, and prostacyclin has a vasodilator effect as well. This suggests that the endothelium is involved in regulation of vascular permeability. In the document '[Bioelectrical properties and ultrastructure of vascular smooth muscle cells in tissue culture]', it is mentioned that the arterial cyclic GMP pathway is predominantly under control of the endothelial function to secrete NO (nitric oxide). This further supports the idea that the endothelium plays a role in regulation of vascular permeability. Therefore, we can infer that the cell releasing vasoactive amine to increase vascular permeability is likely the endothelial cell.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
