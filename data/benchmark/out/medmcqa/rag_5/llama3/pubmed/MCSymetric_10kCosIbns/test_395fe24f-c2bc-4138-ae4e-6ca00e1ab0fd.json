["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the pattern of change where pandemics of infection are replaced by degenerative and manmade disorders as the main cause of morbidity and mortality. The relevant documents describe this transition. From the first document, we see that there has been a shift from communicable diseases to chronic degenerative diseases contributing more to general morbidity and death. The second document mentions the 'worst case' scenario for the burden of fatal disease in a poor agrarian society precariously dependent on starchy staples and a narrow range of other foods, which is different from modern societies where life expectancy may be as low as 20. From the third document, we can infer that the relationship between economic development and disease is complex, with 'progress' achieved by countering (and then doing better than countering) the adverse effects of earlier developments.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
