["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the characteristics of limbal epithelial stem cells, including their ability to grow and differentiate in serum-free culture. The document [A serum-free clonal growth assay for limbal, peripheral, and central corneal epithelium] mentions that immunofluorescent staining with monoclonal antibody AE-5 indicates the corneal derivation of all colonies, suggesting that this marker is specific to corneal cells. Furthermore, the document [The human limbus. A scanning electron microscopic study] describes the morphology of human limbal epithelial cells, including their size and shape, which may be relevant to the identification of stem cells.\n\nTherefore, considering these characteristics, we can infer that the universal marker of limbal epithelial stem cells is likely to be a protein or antigen specific to corneal cells, such as AE-5.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: ABCG2\""]
