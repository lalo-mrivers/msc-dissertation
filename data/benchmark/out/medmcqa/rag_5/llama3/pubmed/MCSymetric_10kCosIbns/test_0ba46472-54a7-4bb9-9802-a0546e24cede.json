["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The given documents describe the effects of citalopram, which is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). Since escitalopram is also an SSRI, we can expect similar effects. The documents mention that tricyclic antidepressants cause cardiotoxic effects not observed with SSRIs like citalopram. There are no specific adverse effects mentioned in the documents that are unique to citalopram or SSRIs. Therefore, we can assume that escitalopram would have similar effects.\n\nThe options provided include vivid dreaming, anorgasmia, sialorrhea, and nausea. Vivid dreaming is not a typical adverse effect of SSRI antidepressants like citalopram. Anorgasmia is a known potential side effect of SSRIs. Sialorrhea (excessive drooling) is not typically associated with SSRI antidepressants. Nausea can occur as a side effect of some antidepressants, including SSRIs.\n\nBased on the information provided, vivid dreaming is an adverse effect that cannot be explained by escitalopram.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
