["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has a steering wheel injury to the right side of chest with breathlessness and shock. Both tension pneumothorax and cardiac tamponade can cause respiratory distress and hypotension. To differentiate between them, I will consider the haemodynamic aspects mentioned in the documents. A case report on anaesthesia for operation of traumatic heart tamponade suggests that pericardial effusion is a hallmark of cardiac tamponade, whereas extrinsic compression of the heart by tumor can masquerade as cardiac tamponade without discernible pericardial effusion. Tension pneumothorax, on the other hand, is characterized by difficulty to ventilation, unusual breath sounds, and rapid onset of circulatory collapse. Considering these factors, I will focus on signs related to respiratory mechanics.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
