["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the characteristics of heart muscle. We have documents that describe the myocardium, heart contractile proteins, biochemical studies on mammalian cardiac muscles, and some recent results of the quantitative characterization of heart muscle cells. From these documents, we can infer that heart muscle cells are not syncytia (not a single cell), do not have multiple nuclei, but they do have gap junctions which allow for communication between adjacent cells. Therefore, options A, B, and D do not apply to heart muscle.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
