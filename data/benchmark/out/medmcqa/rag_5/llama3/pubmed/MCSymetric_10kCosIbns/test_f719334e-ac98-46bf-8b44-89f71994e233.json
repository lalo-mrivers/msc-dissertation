["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe various materials' properties, such as bending strength, microelastic properties, viscoelastic properties, and mechanical characteristics. Modulus of elasticity is mentioned in the context of these properties. In the [Bending strength in modeling materials] document, it is stated that a modulus of elasticity was measured for 15 materials, with 12 exceeding a necessary value of 20 N/mm2. This suggests that modulus of elasticity refers to a material's stiffness or rigidity. Similarly, in the [Mechanical characteristics of biological soft tissue] document, Young's modulus is mentioned as a measure of a material's stiffness. Therefore, it can be inferred that modulus of elasticity means the rigidity or stiffness of the material.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
