["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, I will go through the provided documents to identify relevant information about statistical tests. From 'The choice of statistical tests', I understand that non-parametric tests are distribution-free tests that can be used without assuming a specific distribution for the data. In 'Power of the independent samples t test under a prevalent psychometric measure distribution', there is no mention of non-parametric tests, but it does discuss the power of the independent samples t-test with respect to type I error. 'Statistical tests in medical research' highlights common errors in medical articles, including misinterpretation of p-values or non-significant results and confusion between statistical and clinical significance. Finally, 'Application of Bayes's theorem to results of quantitative clinical chemical determinations' discusses the use of likelihood ratios and predictive values, but does not mention non-parametric tests.\n\nFrom this information, I can conclude that a non-parametric test is one that does not assume a specific distribution for the data and can be used without such assumptions. This suggests that option C: Mann whitney test might be the correct answer, as it is a non-parametric test used to compare two groups of samples.\n\nTherefore, my choice is:\", \n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
