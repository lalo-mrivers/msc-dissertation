["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the type of tongue thrusting with the worst prognosis. The relevant documents discuss tongue thrust in various contexts, including its relationship to malocclusion, orthodontic treatment, and myofunctional therapy. One document mentions that many openbite malocclusions are treatable without myofunctional therapy, while another discusses the importance of bolus control in peripheral seal swallowing during the voluntary movements in preparation for swallowing. None of these discussions suggest a specific type of tongue thrusting with a worse prognosis. However, one study suggests that the tongue plays an important role in the recurrence after operative correction of mandibular prognathism, and that reducing the size of the tongue can be helpful in preventing such recidivism.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
