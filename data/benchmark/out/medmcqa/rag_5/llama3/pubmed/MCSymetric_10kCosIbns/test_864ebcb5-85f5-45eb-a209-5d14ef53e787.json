["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, let's look at the relevant documents. We have cases of hanging, including a case where the young boy intended to 'stretch' himself out by tying a rope around his neck and another end around the door-handle. In this case, the knot was likely placed at the back of the neck. Then we have forensic medical examinations that mention strangulation grooves on the corpse's neck after hanging. The presence of bruises on the neck indicates a strangulation made by the hands. We also have a case where self-experiments aimed at reconstructing the circumstances had, in pathophysiological respect, the result of a method of self-strangulation similar to a typical hanging. All these cases suggest that the knot is placed at the back of the neck.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"]
