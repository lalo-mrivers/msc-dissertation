["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to the provided documents, it is clear that ultrasound evaluation of IUGR (Intrauterine Fetal Growth Retardation) can be made by multiple parameters. The most reliable one mentioned in [Ultrasound diagnosis of poor intrauterine fetal growth (P.I.F.G): reliabilities and limits of biparietal diameter (B.P.D.) and anteroposterior diameter of the abdomen (A.P.A.D.)] is A.P.A.O., but it is not among the provided options. [Detection of intrauterine fetal growth retardation using ultrasound fetometry] suggests that estimated foetal weight according to the formula of Hadlock et al. has a high sensitivity and specificity for detecting IUGR, but this is not a single parameter. Finally, [Gray scale ultrasound in obstetrics and gynecology] does not provide specific information about ultrasound evaluation of IUGR. In contrast, [The use of ultrasound in multiple gestations] mentions that fetal biparietal diameter correlates well with gestational age, particularly when the characteristic growth pattern of twins is taken into account. Therefore, BPD seems to be a reasonable choice.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
