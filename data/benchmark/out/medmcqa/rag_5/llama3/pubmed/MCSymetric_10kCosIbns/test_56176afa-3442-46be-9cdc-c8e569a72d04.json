["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about a papule on hand that turned into an ulcer in someone working in an abattoir. The relevant documents mention cutaneous amoebic ulcer, phagedenic ulcers, oral ulceration, and benign ulceration of the cecum, but they do not seem to be directly related to this case.
