["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the interaction of haptens with antibodies. Haptens are small molecules that can elicit an immune response when attached to a carrier protein. They are not proteins themselves but can become immunogenic when complexed with a larger molecule. This is evident from the studies on antibody-hapten interactions in vivo, where mice and sheep with circulating antibody to haptens showed increased levels of hapten in their plasma after injection of the hapten. The documents also describe the characteristics of haptoglobin (Hp), which is an acute-phase reactant that can stimulate bone resorption and prostanoid formation. Haptoglobin is a protein, whereas haptens are small molecules. Therefore, it is clear that haptens are nonprotein and antigenic.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"]
