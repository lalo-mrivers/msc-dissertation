["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Since we are looking for a 90% confidence interval, we can use the estimation of reference ranges document to determine that approximately 200 people are required for stable lower (2.5%) and upper (97.5%) reference limits to be obtained. Since we have an average GFR and standard deviation, we can assume that this information is enough to estimate the range for a 90% confidence interval. Therefore, we will use the given mean and standard deviation to calculate the range.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B\n}"]
