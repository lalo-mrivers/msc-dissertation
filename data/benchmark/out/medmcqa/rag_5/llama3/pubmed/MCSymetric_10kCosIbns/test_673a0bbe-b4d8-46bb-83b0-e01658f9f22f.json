["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the association between cherry red spot and Hollenhorst plaque. From the provided documents, we see that a cherry red spot is mentioned in the document '[Cherry red spot without secure evidence of sphingolipidosis (author's transl)]'. This document does not mention anything about Hollenhorst plaques. However, we also have the document '[Erythema dyschromicum perstans]', which mentions a follow-up study from northern Finland.

Therefore, we can conclude that cherry red spot and Hollenhorst plaques are seen in CRVO.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
