["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The given deformity is hyperextension of metacarpophalangeal joints with flexion at the proximal interphalangeal joint. The key point to note here is that this deformity does not involve the extensor mechanism, as it would in a typical apex palmar angulation of proximal phalangeal fractures (document 2). This suggests that the injury may be affecting the intrinsic muscles or their tendons, which could explain the simultaneous flexion at the proximal interphalangeal joint. Furthermore, the study on patterns of movement of totally intrinsic-minus fingers (document 3) highlights the complex and simultaneous nature of long flexor and extensor activity in producing movement at the metacarpophalangeal and proximal interphalangeal joints.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
