["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking what is true about propofol except. From the provided documents, we know that propofol has a rapid recovery rate as it was used to rapidly bring under control the seizures and EEG activity in status epilepticus patients. Propofol is also used for induction and maintenance of anesthesia as it is approved by the Norwegian authorities for anaesthesia for less than three hours in adults. The documents do not mention propofol causing vomiting after use, but they do mention that clinically relevant plasma concentrations of propofol have been reported to be 1-5 x 10(-5) mol litre-1, which corresponds to a concentration range found to produce relaxation at high concentrations (10(-4) mol litre-1). Therefore, option D is true. The remaining options A and B are also true.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
