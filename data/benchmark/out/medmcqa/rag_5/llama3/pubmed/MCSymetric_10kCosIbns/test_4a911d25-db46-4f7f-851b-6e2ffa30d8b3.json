["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, we can analyze the determinants of mechanical properties of bones. The compressive strength of bone is proportional to the square of the apparent density (Bone compressive strength: the influence of density and strain rate). This suggests that the mineral component plays a significant role in resisting compression. Additionally, the overview of the determinants of the strength and stiffness of bone highlights the importance of composition (mineralization) and organization (cortical bone architecture) in determining mechanical properties.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
