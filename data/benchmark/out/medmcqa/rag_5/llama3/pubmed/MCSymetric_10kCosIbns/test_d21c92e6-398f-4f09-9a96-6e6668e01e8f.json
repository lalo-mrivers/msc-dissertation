["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the characteristics of a partogram. From the provided documents, I can see that the partogram consists of three parts: general data, uterine cervix progression, and newborn's vital symptoms. The authors also present six partograms showing different characteristics and pathologic conditions. The document 'Role of the partogram in the modern conduction of labor' mentions that the back of the partogram contains columns for general data, the position of the fetus, the results of amnioscopy and prepartal cardiotocography with the oxytocin test. This suggests that each small square may not represent one hour. The document 'Use of labor graphs in a community hospital' reports on the comparison between normal and abnormal labors, but it does not specify the exact time interval represented by each small square. Therefore, we cannot conclude that each small square represents one hour.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
