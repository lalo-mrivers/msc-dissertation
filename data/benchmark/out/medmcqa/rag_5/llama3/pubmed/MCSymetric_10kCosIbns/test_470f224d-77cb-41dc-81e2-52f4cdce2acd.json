["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about causes of thyroid storm. From the documents provided, I see that one of them (Rational therapy for thyroid storm) describes a treatment regimen for managing patients with thyroid storm. This regimen involves using propranolol to inhibit catecholamine-mediated peripheral effects, propylthiouracil to inhibit thyroid hormone synthesis and conversion, iodine to block glandular release of thyroid hormones, and dexamethasone along with general supportive therapy. This suggests that the documents provide information about the pathogenesis and treatment of thyroid storm, but not its causes.\n\nAnother document (Serum triiodothyronine concentration in thyroid storm) mentions elevated serum triiodothyronine levels in patients with thyroid storm, but notes that this is not a simple increase in serum triiodothyronine concentration. This suggests that the pathogenesis of thyroid storm may be complex and involve multiple mechanisms.\n\nA search through the other documents (Psychiatric and neurologic disturbances in thyroid disorders and [Struma, hyper- and hypothyroidism]) does not provide direct information about the causes of thyroid storm. However, they do provide general information about the effects of the thyroid gland on the nervous system and the diagnosis of thyroid disorders.\n\nTherefore, I will focus on the symptoms and pathogenesis described in the documents to answer the question. The text suggests that thyroid storm is characterized by rapid increases in serum triiodothyronine levels, which are not the primary cause of the condition but rather a symptom. Therefore, the causes of thyroid storm are not related to ineffective pre-operative hormonal control, manhandling of the thyroid gland during surgery, parathyroid tail left after surgery, or poor preoperative preparation of the patient.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
