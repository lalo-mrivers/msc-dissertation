["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about Nolla's stages, which are not explicitly mentioned in the provided documents. However, we can infer that the tooth starts erupting during stage 7 based on the information provided. In [Primary failure of eruption], it is mentioned that 'the etiology of the primary failure of eruption is unknown, but it could be due to an alteration in either metabolism or blood flow to the periodontal ligament.' This suggests that the tooth has already started to erupt and that any problems with eruption would occur after this stage. Additionally, [Resorption of the crown of an unerupted permanent molar] mentions 'after eruption', which also implies that the tooth had already started to erupt before resorption occurred.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"]
