["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To estimate the 95% confidence interval (CI) for an estimated prevalence of 10% and a sample size of 100, we need to consider the relevant documents provided. The 'Evaluation of a standardized survey design proposed for use in epidemiological research on AIDS' suggests that the methodology used will generally fail to provide estimates accurate to within 1% of the true population value. However, if the primary objective is to construct confidence intervals that include the true population HIV seroprevalence rate, then this survey method appears to be a reasonable choice. The 'Estimation of disease frequency using a population sample' also suggests that the sampling technique may be of value in areas where financial and manpower resources are limited. Since we have enough information to estimate the confidence interval, we can proceed with the calculation.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
