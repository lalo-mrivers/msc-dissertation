["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the chances of recurrence of multicystic ameloblastoma after surgical enucleation. We can infer from the documents that unicystic ameloblastomas have a lower rate of recurrence compared to multicystic ones. The document 'Unicystic ameloblastoma: a prognostically distinct entity' states that the rate of recurrence for unilocular cystic lesions is distinctly lower than that associated with multicystic character of the lesion throughout its course, indicating a much less aggressive variety of neoplasm. This implies that unicystic lesions have a lower recurrence rate. Since multicystic ameloblastoma has a higher recurrence rate compared to unicystic ones, we can conclude that the chances of recurrence after surgical enucleation for multicystic ameloblastoma is higher than unicystic ones.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C: 50-100%\""]
