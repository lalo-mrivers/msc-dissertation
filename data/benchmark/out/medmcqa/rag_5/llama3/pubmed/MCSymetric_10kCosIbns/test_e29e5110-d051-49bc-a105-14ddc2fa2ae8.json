["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The provided documents mention CpG islands as gene markers in the human genome. It is stated that CpG islands are associated with genes and cover at least a part of one exon. All housekeeping and widely expressed genes have a CpG island covering the transcription start, whereas 40% of the genes with a tissue-specific or limited expression are associated with islands. The position of the islands was not biased toward the 5' end of the transcription unit.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
