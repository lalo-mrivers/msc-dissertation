["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about a 5-year-old male child who has had anaemia and jaundice since birth. The relevant documents suggest that causes of jaundice in children include idiopathic hepatitis, prematurity, ABO erythroblastosis, Rh erythroblastosis, bruising, multifactorial causes, and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency.
