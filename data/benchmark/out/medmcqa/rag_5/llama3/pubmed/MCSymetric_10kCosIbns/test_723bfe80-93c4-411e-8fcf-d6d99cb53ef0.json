["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to the documents, it is stated that an implant should be surrounded by at least 1 mm of bone. For a size 4 mm implant, this means that there needs to be at least 5 mm (4 mm + 1 mm) of bone in the ridge for proper placement and function. Since two implants are being placed, we need to consider the total width required. A reasonable estimate would be to add the widths together, considering some overlap between the implants. Assuming a minimum 1 mm overlap, this brings us to at least 12 mm (5 mm + 7 mm) for the ridge width.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B: 15 mm\"\n}"]
