["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about dimorphic fungi. We need to identify which of the options is not a dimorphic fungus. Based on the provided documents, we know that some opportunistic filamentous fungi present in the CBS culture collection can cause deep mycosis. The spectrum includes species that are pathogenic or opportunistic and have adaptations to life under hostile environmental conditions. Some of these opportunistic fungi possess melanin or carotene as an important virulence factor.\n\nFrom [Morphologic and physiologic characteristics of Costa Rica pathogenic fungi (Dermatiaceae)], we learn about the morphological and physiological characteristics of dematiaceous fungi, including those that are pathogenic. We also have information from [Genetic aspects of opportunistic fungi] about the general genetical behavior of various groups.\n\nThe question asks us to identify which of the options is not a dimorphic fungus. The documents provide no specific information about P. marneffi, Histoplasma capsulatum, or Blastomyces dermatitidis being non-dimorphic. However, we do have information about Pneumocystis jirovecii in [Genetic aspects of opportunistic fungi], which mentions the etiologic agents of human mycoses in taxonomic order.\n\nBased on this information, we can conclude that Pneumocystis jirovecii is not a dimorphic fungus.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
