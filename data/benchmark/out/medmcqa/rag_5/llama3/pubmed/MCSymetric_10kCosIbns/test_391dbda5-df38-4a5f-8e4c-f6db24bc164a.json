["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents are about the peripheral refraction of the human eye, an eye model to show fundamental optical properties as related to refraction and glasses-testing, contribution on the infraocular optics, dependence of intraocular straylight on pigmentation and light transmission through the ocular wall, and calculation of the optical power of intraocular lenses. We are looking for the maximum contribution to the refractive power of the eye. The cornea is mentioned in both [On the peripheral refraction of the human eye (author's transl)] and [An eye-model to show fundamental optical properties as related to refraction and glasses-testing (author's transl)]. According to these documents, the anterior surface of the cornea plays a significant role in the refractive power of the eye. Therefore, it is likely that this part of the eye makes the maximum contribution.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
