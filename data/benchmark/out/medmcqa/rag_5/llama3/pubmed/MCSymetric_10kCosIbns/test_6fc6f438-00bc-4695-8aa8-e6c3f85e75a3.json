["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the organisms implicated in the etiology of periodontal disease. The provided documents discuss bacterial contamination, familial occurrence, and immunologic mechanisms of pathogenesis in periodontal diseases. There is no mention of any specific organism being responsible for periodontal disease. Therefore, I will look at the options: A (Bacteroides) is mentioned as one type of bacteria that can be cultured or detected using a DNA probe; B (Wolinella), C (Neisseria), and D (Eikenella) are all types of oral bacteria. Based on this information, I conclude that the correct answer is not an organism that is implicated in periodontal disease.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
