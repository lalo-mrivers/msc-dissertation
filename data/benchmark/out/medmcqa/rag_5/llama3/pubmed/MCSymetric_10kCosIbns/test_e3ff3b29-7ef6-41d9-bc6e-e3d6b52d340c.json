["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant document for this question is the first one, which discusses the spectral distribution of /s/ and its frequency response. According to this document, repeated tokens of /s/ were recorded from five men and five women before and between the vowels /u/, /a/, and /i/. Using fast Fourier transform analysis, the prominent spectral peak with the lowest frequency was identified and its center frequency determined for each token. This frequency averaged around 4.9 kHz for the /u/ context, 5.6 kHz for the /a/ context, and 6.0 kHz for the /i/ context. There were dramatic differences among talkers, with subject means ranging from 3.2 to 8.4 kHz. Therefore, it can be inferred that sibilant sounds are produced at a frequency range of around 4.9-6.0 kHz.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
