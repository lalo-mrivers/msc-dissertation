["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents discuss abutment teeth, bridges, and clasping systems. In the document 'Bridge abutments and bridge anchors--functional, technological and methodological aspects', it is mentioned that fixed partial prostheses form a functional unity with the abutment teeth and periodontium, implying that these relationships are important to consider when designing bridges or dentures. The documents also discuss various techniques for recording tissue and abutment relationships, including the modified technique presented in the first document, which reduces chair-tite and discomfort for the patient.\n\nThe document 'The effect of various clasping systems on the mobility of abutment teeth for distal-extension removable partial dentures' discusses the importance of fit of the distal-extension denture base over the residual ridge in preventing increases in abutment mobility. This suggests that factors such as fit and stability are important to consider when designing dentures.\n\nThe document 'Long-term experience in endosseous endodontic implantation' presents results from 9 years of experience with transfixed abutment-teeth for bar-joint dentures, including measurements of tooth mobility over a period of 20 months. This suggests that long-term stability is an important consideration when designing bridges or dentures.\n\nBased on these considerations, it seems clear that guiding planes on abutment teeth are intended to provide predictable clasp retention.\",\n\"answer_choice\": A"]
