["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the total number of vertebrae present in the vertebral column. The first document 'Collapsed Vertebrae: A Review of 659 Autopsies' does not provide information on the total number of vertebrae. The second document 'Anatomo-functional properties of the vertebral axis' explains the mechanics of the vertebral column but does not mention the total number of vertebrae. The third document 'The Number of Vertebrae in the Southern African Negro, the American Negro and the Bushman (San)' compares the numbers of precoccygeal vertebrae (PCV) in different populations, but this is not directly related to the question. The fourth document 'Human Lumbar Vertebrae: Quantitative Three-dimensional Anatomy' discusses the anatomy of human lumbar vertebrae, and while it mentions the number of lumbar vertebrae (5), it does not provide information on the total number of vertebrae in the vertebral column. Therefore, we need to look at other relevant documents.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
