["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question states that the prospectively evaluated, double-blinded, randomized clinical trial represents the 'gold-standard' for providing evidence for therapeutic decision making. This concept was first proposed by someone known as the father of evidence-based medicine. The relevant documents discuss clinical trials methodology and emphasize the importance of controlled clinical trials in answering comparative therapeutic questions. We also have a section on interpretation of data by the clinician, which highlights the need for careful appraisal of data and consideration of the benefit/risk ratio for each patient.
