["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the provided documents, Eisenmenger's syndrome is characterized by a complex set of hemodynamic changes. It is associated with increased pulmonary vascular resistance, right-to-left shunting, and decreased peripheral vascular resistance. The symptoms and signs described in the documents include decreased peripheral vascular resistance, reflex bradycardia secondary to postural changes, hypovolemia, thromboembolic phenomena, and preeclampsia.\n\nIncreased flow murmur across tricuspid and pulmonary valve is a characteristic finding in Eisenmenger's syndrome. Single S2 (second heart sound) is not specifically mentioned as a sign of impending Eisenmenger's syndrome. Loud P2 (pulmonary valve closure sound) can occur in patients with increased pulmonary vascular resistance, but it is not exclusive to Eisenmenger's syndrome. Graham Steel murmur is not a characteristic finding in Eisenmenger's syndrome.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B: Single S2.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
