["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about confirming a diagnosis of internal derangement of TMJ fracture. Since the panoramic view has been taken for the patient, we are looking for another imaging modality to support our diagnosis. The relevant documents suggest that ultrasound imaging was used in the past to investigate TMJ internal derangements. However, this study did not involve fractures. There is no mention of using MRI, CT scan or bone scan for such a purpose. Therefore, we need to look elsewhere.

This is the most relevant option considering our diagnosis.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
