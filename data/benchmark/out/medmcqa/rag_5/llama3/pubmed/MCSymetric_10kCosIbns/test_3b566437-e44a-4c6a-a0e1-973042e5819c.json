["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the [Demonstration of temporary multi-innervation of the cerebellar Purkinje cells by the ascending fibers during development in the rat] document, it is mentioned that the cerebellar Purkinje cells are innervated by several independent climbing fibres. This suggests that the fibers reaching directly to Purkinje cell of cerebellum arise from the Inferior olivary nucleus (B). Furthermore, [Electrophysiologic analysis of the functional organization of cortico-cerebellar connections] document also supports this conclusion as it mentions about the responses to inferior olive stimulation on PC units. Therefore, the answer is B: Inferior olivary nucleus.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
