["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, electrical interference is discussed as a problem in hospitals, affecting monitoring equipment and causing failures. The document '[The contact-free control of the functional state: the experience of its practical use]' does not explicitly mention working side interference or cusps, but it talks about contactless control methods and their application in practice. Another document '[Effect of system-related work interruptions in computer-assisted text processing: a field study]' discusses human-computer interaction and system response times, which is different from working side interference. Therefore, none of the documents provide information on guiding or supporting cusps that could help reduce working side interference.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: None.\""]
