["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 2-month-old girl with failure to thrive, polyuria, and medullary nephrocalcinosis affecting both kidneys. The investigations show blood pH 7.48, bicarbonate 25 mEq/l, potassium 2 mEq/l, sodium 126 mEq/l, and chloride 88 mEq/l. Nephrocalcinosis is uncommon in childhood, but it can occur due to renal tubular acidosis, hyperparathyroidism, medullary sponge kidney, or hypercalcaemia/hypercalciuria of any aetiology. The patient's blood pH is high and bicarbonate is low, suggesting metabolic alkalosis. This, along with the presence of nephrocalcinosis, makes renal tubular acidosis a possible cause.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
