["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the functions of the inferior oblique muscle. We have to look at the relevant documents for information about this muscle. The first document talks about the superior oblique muscle, but it doesn't mention the inferior oblique muscle. The second document compares the contractile and histochemical properties of the inferior oblique muscles in rats and cats, but it's not directly related to the question. The third document discusses cyclofusion measurements for assessing the function of the oblique eye muscles, which is also not relevant to the question. The fourth document talks about internal ophthalmoplegia following inferior oblique myectomy, which provides information about the muscle's function. According to this document, the inferior oblique muscle is responsible for downward rotation and extortion. Upward rotation is mentioned in the first paragraph of one of the documents as being caused by the superior oblique muscle, not the inferior oblique muscle. Lateral rotation is not mentioned at all in any of the documents. Therefore, the correct answer is B: Lateral rotation.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
