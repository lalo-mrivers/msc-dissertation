["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the documents, it is clear that LDL receptor recognizes apo B100 (as mentioned in 'Interaction between LDL receptor and lipoproteins containing apo B') and apo E (as mentioned in 'Expression of LDL receptor on tumor cells induced by growth factors' and 'Interaction between LDL receptor and lipoproteins containing apo B'). Moreover, the LDL receptor is involved in endocytosis process (as mentioned in 'Receptor-mediated endocytosis: insights from the lipoprotein receptor system'). Additionally, the presence of LDL receptor is not limited to hepatic cells only; it can be found on extrahepatic cells like tumor cells and endothelial cells (as mentioned in 'Expression of LDL receptor on tumor cells induced by growth factors' and 'Discrete subspecies of human low density lipoproteins are heterogeneous in their interaction with the cellular LDL receptor'). Therefore, option D: All of the above is correct.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
