["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the given documents, we can see that time-dependent deformation is a characteristic of some materials. In 'Time-dependent deformation of some direct compression excipients', it was found that Sta-Rx compacts exhibited time-dependent deformation in diametral compression tests. This suggests that if the rate of loading is decreased, the mechanical properties of these materials may change over time.\n\nIn 'Viscoelastic properties of elastomeric impression materials. II: variation of rheological properties with time, temperature and mixing proportions', it was found that the bending strength to the breakage point dropped about 20% during the course of 8-10 days for some samples. This suggests that mechanical properties may change over time if the rate of loading is decreased.\n\nTherefore, based on these findings, we can conclude that the mechanical properties of materials may change over time if the rate of loading is decreased.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
