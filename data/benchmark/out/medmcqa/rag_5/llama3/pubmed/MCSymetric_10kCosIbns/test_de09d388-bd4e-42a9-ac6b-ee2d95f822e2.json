["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a newborn with cyanosis. The X-ray chest shows oligemic lung field and normal-sized heart. Considering the documents provided, we are looking for a congenital heart disease that can cause cyanosis in a newborn. Since the X-ray shows oligemic lung field, it suggests that there is a significant obstruction to pulmonary blood flow. Additionally, the patient's age is consistent with a diagnosis of CHD in the newborn period. Based on these findings, we need to look for a 'major' criterion that fits this presentation.\n\nFrom the documents provided, one of the 'major' criteria for serious heart disease includes permanent cyanosis, pallor or greyish color, which matches our patient's presentation. Furthermore, oligemic lung field in an X-ray is also consistent with this diagnosis.\n\nConsidering these findings and the documents provided, the most likely diagnosis is Tetralogy of Fallot, as it is a common congenital heart disease that can cause cyanosis, particularly in newborns.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
