["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The concept of reciprocal arm taper is related to the biomechanical constant mentioned in [The correlation of the segments of the extremities as a biomechanical constant in man and mammals]. This constant regulates the proportionality of bone links as a mechanical lever. The provided documents do not directly address the topic of arm taper, but they provide information on the length and structure of various forearm muscles, as well as the kinematics of the human hand. Therefore, to analyze the reciprocal arm taper, we need to look at the relevant data from these studies. According to [Architecture of selected muscles of the arm and forearm: anatomy and implications for tendon transfer], the individual digital extensor muscles are relatively similar in architectural structure, and the deep and superficial digital flexors have very similar architecturally. This suggests that there may be a reciprocal relationship between the length and structure of these muscle groups. Furthermore, [Anthropometric data for describing the kinematics of the human hand] provides information on the lengths of the kinematic segments using external hand length as the independent variable. This data can be used to analyze the reciprocal arm taper in relation to the biomechanical constant.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
