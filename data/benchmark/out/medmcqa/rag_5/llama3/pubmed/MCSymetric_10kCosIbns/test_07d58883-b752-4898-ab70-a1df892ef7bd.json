["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the effect of defective Rb gene phosphorylation on the cell cycle. According to the documents, Rb protein is a negative regulator of cellular proliferation that can complex with DRTF1 and modulate transcription. Phosphorylation of Rb protein by adenovirus E1a or other kinases allows it to be sequestered by cyclin A. Cyclin A facilitates the efficient assembly of the Rb protein into the complex, which regulates transcription. If Rb gene phosphorylation is defective, this means that Rb protein cannot be properly regulated and will not be able to complex with DRTF1 or modulate transcription. This would likely lead to an abnormal cell cycle.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
