["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the chief supply of the phrenic nerve. Based on the provided documents, it can be inferred that the phrenic nerve innervates the heart and participates in the rhythm of the heartbeat (Functional and morphologic changes in the heart following phrenicotomy). Additionally, experiments have shown that the phrenic nerve has motoric fibers with a high enzyme activity, classified as A-alpha fibres, which are interpreted as motoric. Furthermore, the studies on postganglionic sympathetic neurons suggest that axons of these neurons could possibly be diaphragmatic muscle vasoconstrictors.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
