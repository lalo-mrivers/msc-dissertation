["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to the documents provided, lasers have been developed for arthroscopic surgery. Initially, attempts were made to modify CO2 and Nd: YAG lasers, but they proved unsuitable. Three suitable systems were eventually developed: excimer, holmium: YAG (Ho-YAG), and erbium: YAG. Holmium: YAG-laser was chosen as the best compromise for arthroscopy. Since TMJ adhesion lysis is a procedure done in arthroscopy, it's likely that Ho-YAG laser would be used.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
