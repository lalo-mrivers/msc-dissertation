["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to the provided documents, X-Linked SCID is one of the five major human X-linked immunodeficiencies. The document 'Molecular approaches to analysis of X-linked immunodeficiencies' mentions that the genes involved in these diseases have been precisely defined and the cell lineages and stages of differentiation in which the genes are expressed have been partly identified. Additionally, the document 'The molecular basis of X-linked immunodeficiency disease' states that substantial progress has been made in identifying the genes which are defective in the other five diseases, including X-Linked SCID. Therefore, it is likely that the gene involved in X-Linked SCID is one of the genes mentioned as being defective in this disease.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
