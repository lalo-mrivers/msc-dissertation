["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the documents, we can see that the orange juice consumption affects urinary pH. Specifically, the document 'Effect of orange juice consumption on urinary pH' states that consuming 1500 ml of orange juice changes the urinary pH by an average of one pH unit. This implies that the orange juice contains some substance that affects the pH of urine. Since we know that orange juice is acidic (high in citric acid and ascorbic acid), it's likely that the drug which gives orange color to the urine is one that is affected by this change in pH. Rifampicin, Ethambutol, INH, and Streptomycin are all antibiotics known to affect urinary pH, but only Rifampicin has a well-documented tendency to turn urine orange due to its ability to produce a fluorescent compound called fluorescein.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
