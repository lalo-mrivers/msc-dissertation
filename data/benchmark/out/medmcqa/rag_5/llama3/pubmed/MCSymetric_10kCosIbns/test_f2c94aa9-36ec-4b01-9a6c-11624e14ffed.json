["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about when orthodontic treatment can be done for patients with ALL (Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia). I'll look at the provided documents to find information related to adult patients, as it seems that's the relevant group in this case. In [The concept of orthodontic treatment for the adult], we see a classification of adult patients into three groups: those motivated for cosmetic reasons, those suffering from anxiety states, and those who need treatment before prosthetic rehabilitation or physical disorders.\n\nLooking at these categories, I don't find any information that suggests chemotherapy is involved. The documents only discuss orthodontic treatment in general, without mentioning ALL or cancer.\n\nIn [When to start orthodontic treatment], we see a classification of the best age to begin orthodontic treatment according to the type of malocclusion. This is not directly relevant to the question about treating patients with ALL.\n\n[Failures and limitations of orthodontics in general practice] presents 5 cases to review the causes of orthodontic failure, but it doesn't mention chemotherapy or ALL either.\n\nBased on these documents, I can conclude that there's no information that suggests orthodontic treatment should be done during or after chemotherapy. Therefore, I will choose an answer that reflects this lack of information.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: Any time as not affected by ALL\""]
