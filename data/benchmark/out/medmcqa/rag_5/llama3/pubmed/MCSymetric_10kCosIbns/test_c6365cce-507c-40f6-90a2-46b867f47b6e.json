["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The provided documents describe different types of axonal transport. The first document mentions retrograde axonal transport as a mechanism for certain macromolecules to enter neurons. The second document discusses slow axonal flow and the movement of cytoskeletal proteins within axons, which is likely associated with a transport complex. The third document reviews rapid axonal transport and its relationship to membranous organelles, describing sites where transport may differ from the secretory model. The fourth document explores retention and redistribution of proteins in mammalian nerve fibers by axoplasmic transport.\n\nConsidering these documents, it is clear that there are different types of axonal transport: retrograde, slow, rapid, and fast axoplasmic transport. Therefore, the correct answer is C: Antegrade and retrograde.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
