["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 36-week primigravida who had a single seizure episode. Her blood pressure is elevated at 170/100 mmHg, which is consistent with severe pre-eclampsia. The fetal heart rate is present, indicating that the pregnancy is still viable. The initial management should focus on stabilizing the patient's vital signs and preventing further seizures.\n\nThe patient's blood pressure needs to be controlled, as elevated pressures can lead to further complications, including stroke or placental abruption. Magnesium sulfate (MgSO4) is a commonly used anticonvulsant in pregnancy, which also has a role in reducing blood pressure.\n\nThere is no indication of hypocalcemia, which would warrant calcium gluconate administration.\n\nPhenobarbital is an anticonvulsant that may be considered for seizure prophylaxis, but it is not the primary concern at this point.\n\nMRI brain is not relevant to the immediate management of a patient with severe pre-eclampsia and seizures.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
