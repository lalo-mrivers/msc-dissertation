["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents mention the composition of dental amalgam has improved over the last 20 years to reduce marginal failure due to creep and corrosion. The use of modern adhesives has also led to an early seal between the tooth and the filling. The article discussing the history, classification, structure, and handling variables of dental amalgams does not specify a particular composition or percentage of mercury (hg) by weight for most modern precapsulated dental amalgam. However, we can look at another document that provides information on dental amalgam alloys. According to this document, dental amalgam is low in cost, easy to use, consistent, and durable, with nearly 75% of all restorative materials used in dental practice being dental amalgam. While the composition of dental amalgams has been discussed, it does not provide a specific percentage of hg by weight for most modern precapsulated dental amalgam. However, we can look at another document that provides information on the biocompatibility testing of some dental amalgams in vivo. This study found that all the dental amalgams tested caused minor responses reflected by the formation of thin capsules with an acceptable matrix organization. By one hundred days, the capsule around Dispersalloy, although generally well formed, showed some areas of cellular activity and matrix variability.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
