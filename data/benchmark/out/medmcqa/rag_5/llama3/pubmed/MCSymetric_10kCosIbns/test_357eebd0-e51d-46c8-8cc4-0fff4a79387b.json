["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, Eustachian tube function is best assessed by considering multiple methods. Initially, it seems that tympanometry was attempted to measure Eustachian tube function but the results were inconsistent with Holmquist's findings and did not distinguish between normal and pathological ears. The forced-response technique was found to be a better method to determine actual tubal function. Moreover, an aerodynamic pattern of Eustachian tube dysfunction was reported using Valsalva's maneuver and deglutition. Finally, electromyographic examination revealed no significant differences in muscle activity between normal and dysfunctional tubes.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
