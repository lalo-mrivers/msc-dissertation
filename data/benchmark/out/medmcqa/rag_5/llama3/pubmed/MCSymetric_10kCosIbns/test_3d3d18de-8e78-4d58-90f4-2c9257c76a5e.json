["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about a fracture that results in a given deformity. The relevant documents discuss fractures in different types of bones, including long bones, calcaneus, and metal implants. Based on the information provided, it seems that the given deformity refers to secondary growth deformities in growing animals, which can occur due to injury to the bones or articular surfaces. This is mentioned in the document 'Principles of fracture fixation in growing animals'. As a result, the deformity likely occurs in long bones. The paper also discusses fractures induced by torsional loads, which have a spiral shape with a smooth and even surface. This type of fracture can occur in long bones. Therefore, it is likely that the given deformity occurs as a result of a spiral fracture in a long bone.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
