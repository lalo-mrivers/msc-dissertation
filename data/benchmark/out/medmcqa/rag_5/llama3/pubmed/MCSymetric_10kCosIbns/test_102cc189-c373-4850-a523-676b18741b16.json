["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks for a 'high angle case', which suggests that the answer is related to a measurement of an angle. The provided documents describe various methods for measuring angles, including tomographic movements and radiographs. None of these descriptions mention specific values or ranges for angles, but they do provide context about the importance of accurate angle measurements in certain medical applications. Given this information, I will focus on the last document that describes a device for obtaining half-axial projections. This document mentions a range of longitudinal deviation from 0 to 20 degrees and horizontal deviation from 0 to 70 degrees. A 'high angle case' would likely involve angles towards the higher end of these ranges. Therefore, I will look for an option that corresponds to a measurement or range of angles that is consistent with this idea.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
