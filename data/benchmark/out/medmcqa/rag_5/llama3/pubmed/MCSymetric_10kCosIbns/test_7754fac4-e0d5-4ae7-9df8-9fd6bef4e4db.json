["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking which statement about incidence is not true. We need to analyze each option carefully. Option A says that incidence decreases when a programme is effective, which is correct because the programme is preventing new cases from occurring. Option B states that vaccination strategies decrease the incidence of a disease, which is also correct as vaccines prevent new cases from happening. Option C suggests that newer and effective treatment modalities decrease the incidence, which is true because they reduce the number of new cases by treating existing ones effectively. The only option that does not seem to be describing a characteristic of incidence is D, which mentions detecting new cases over a fixed time.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
