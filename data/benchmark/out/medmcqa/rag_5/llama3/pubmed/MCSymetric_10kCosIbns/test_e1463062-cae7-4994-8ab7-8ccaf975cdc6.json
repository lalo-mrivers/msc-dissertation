["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the documents provided, we can see that Pseudomonas species are widely implicated in human disease. One of the notable findings is that minocycline shows uniform susceptibility against Pseudomonas isolates. Another document mentions the antibiotic sensitivity of 43 strains of Pseudomonas and found some antibiotics to be active against these microorganisms, including levomycetin, tetracycline, streptomycin, and biseptol. However, we are looking for an antibiotic that is effective against both Pseudomonas and Indole +ve Proteus. The answer can be inferred from the sensitivity patterns of antibiotics tested in one of the documents. \",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
