["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about controlling Postpartum Hemorrhage (PPH) in a patient with heart disease. Based on the provided documents, there is no specific mention of PPH or the treatment options for it. However, we can look at the general principles and requirements mentioned in the documents. For example, in [Anesthesiological problems in cardiopathic patients], it mentions that anaesthetic drugs must meet certain requirements, including no rises in cardiac rhythm. This suggests that any medication used to control PPH should not increase cardiac rhythm. Additionally, [Drug therapy of myocardial infarct in ambulatory practice] mentions the importance of considering the diagnosis of brady- and tachycardiac disturbances of the rhythm when choosing medications.\n\nGiven these general principles, we can look at the potential choices for controlling PPH in a patient with heart disease. Methylergometrine is mentioned in [Practical problems in the long-term drug treatment of ischemic heart disease and hypertension] as being used to treat angina pectoris, but it does not specifically mention its use in controlling PPH.\n\nOxytocin is often used to control bleeding during delivery, and it is possible that this could be used to control PPH. However, [Practical problems in the long-term drug treatment of ischemic heart disease and hypertension] mentions that beta-sympathicolytics can be used to treat sympathico-adrenergic reactions, which suggests that oxytocin may not increase cardiac rhythm.\n\nMisoprostol is mentioned in [Problem analysis. Evaluation of therapeutic means and objectives] as being used to treat ventricular arrhythmias, but it does not specifically mention its use in controlling PPH.\n\nCarboprost is a prostaglandin analogue that can be used to control bleeding during delivery, and it may also be used to control PPH.\n\nBased on these general principles and the information provided about each potential choice, I would conclude that...\", \n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
