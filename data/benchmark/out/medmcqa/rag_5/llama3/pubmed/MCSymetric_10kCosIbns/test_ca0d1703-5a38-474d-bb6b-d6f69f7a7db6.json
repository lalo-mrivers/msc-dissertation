["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the provided documents, we can see that capillary microaneurysms are mentioned as a feature of hypertensive rabbits (Microradiographic study of cerebral and ocular aneurysms in hypertensive rabbits). This suggests a link between hypertension and microaneurysms. Additionally, the document on Ruptured submucosal gastric artery microaneurysm mentions that microaneurysms can lead to gastrointestinal hemorrhage. Furthermore, another document (Angiographic findings with an intracranial gumma) talks about hypervascularity surrounding focal necrosis, which might be related to capillary microaneurysms. Considering these points, it is reasonable to conclude that capillary microaneurysms are an early sign of hypertensive retinopathy.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
