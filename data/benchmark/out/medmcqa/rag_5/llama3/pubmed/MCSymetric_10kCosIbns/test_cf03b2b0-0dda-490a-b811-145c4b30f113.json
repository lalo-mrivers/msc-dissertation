["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the age-related changes in periodontal ligament. From the provided documents, we can see that the study on 'Evolution of human periodontal tissues with ageing' states that the periodontal ligament was found to be widened in the cervical and apical regions with ageing. It also mentions that there is a relative decrease in both suspensory fibers and cellular content in older specimens. Additionally, the study on 'Preservation of probing attachment and alveolar bone levels in 2 random population samples' states that a subsample of individuals whose periodontal status indicated minimal experience of destructive periodontal disease were selected, and it was revealed that a substantial proportion of tooth surfaces remained with no attachment or alveolar bone loss in older subjects. Based on these findings, we can conclude that the age-related changes in periodontal ligament are characterized by a relative decrease in both suspensory fibers and cellular content.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
