["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The given data represents a series of values for the number of dental caries cases reported over the last 10 years. To find the average number of caries cases, we need to determine which type of average is most suitable for this dataset. Since there are no extreme values or outliers that could significantly affect the result, we can consider using either the arithmetic mean or the median. However, considering the number of data points (n=10) and the fact that the data represents a series of consecutive years, the median would be a more robust estimate of the average caries cases reported. Therefore, the most appropriate average for this dataset is the median.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
