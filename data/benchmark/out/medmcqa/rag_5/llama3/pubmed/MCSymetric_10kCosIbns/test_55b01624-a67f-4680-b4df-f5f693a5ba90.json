["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to the document [Measurement of forces in highly elastic regulating rings], we can infer that when the length of a spring is doubled, the force developed on stretching bands of various sizes are tabulated to obtain approximate reference values for practice. This implies that there is a direct relationship between the length and force of a spring.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
