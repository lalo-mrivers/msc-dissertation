["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The given scenario is a 27-year-old lady with 20 weeks pregnancy presenting with a thyroid nodule on the right side, which was suggestive of papillary carcinoma on FNAC. Considering the patient's age and the fact that it's not a 'cold' nodule (as described in the documents), we need to focus on the management strategy for 'hot' nodules or those suspected to be malignant.\n\nThe documents highlight that total thyroidectomy is recommended when there is a suspicion of malignancy, especially in cases where the nodule shows incomplete suppression. However, this patient is pregnant, which makes us cautious about performing a total thyroidectomy.\n\nLooking at the options, we can rule out C: Radioactive iodine ablation as it's not directly contraindicated for pregnancy, but it might be considered if other surgical approaches are not feasible.\n\nWe're left with A: Total thyroidectomy plus neck node dissection and D: Total thyroidectomy. Given the patient's pregnancy status, we cannot perform total thyroidectomy (D), as it would pose risks to both the mother and the foetus.\n\nThe most logical choice is therefore B: Right lobectomy, which would be a more conservative approach while still allowing for some surgical intervention. This option does not involve removing the entire thyroid gland, making it safer for the pregnant patient.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
