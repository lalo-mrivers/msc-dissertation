["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the bone response to an implant as a time-dependent process controlled by wound-healing factors, biomechanics, and mineral metabolism. The osseous response involves four physiological stages: endosteal and periosteal callus formation; compaction and remodeling of the callus; remodeling (turnover) of the nonvital interface and adjacent bone; and maturation (secondary mineralization) of new bone. Long-term maintenance of a rigid implant interface is related to continual bone remodeling.\n\nThe document on 'How to treat ailing and failing implants' describes the treatment of failing implants, including detoxification of the implant surface and guided tissue regeneration. It does not provide information on annual bone loss after 1 year in functional implants.\n\nHowever, the document on 'A semi-automated computer-assisted method for measuring bone loss adjacent to dental implants' provides a method for measuring bone loss around implants. Although it does not specifically mention annual bone loss, it describes the measurement of bone loss as repeatable and suitable for use in clinical trials using root form or blade implants.\n\nBased on these documents, it is not possible to determine the exact amount of bone loss seen annually after 1 year in a functional implant.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
