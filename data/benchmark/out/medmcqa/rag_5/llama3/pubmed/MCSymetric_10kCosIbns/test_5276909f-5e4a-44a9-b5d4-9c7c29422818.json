["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the diagrammatic representation of a bacterium showing its flagella. The relevant documents describe various types of bacterial flagellation. Polarly flagellated bacteria generally swim much faster than peritrichously flagellated bacteria, and turn by abrupt reversals. Since individual filaments can be seen, a genus such as Salmonella, which is peritrichously flagellated, can readily be distinguished from a polarly flagellated genus such as Pseudomonas. Therefore, it is likely that the bacterium depicted in the diagram is polarly flagellated.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
