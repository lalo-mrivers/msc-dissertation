["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe two types of hemorrhagic shock models. In the first model, blood is withdrawn until arterial pressure reaches 40 mmHg and then allowed to recover spontaneously. In the second model, blood is withdrawn until arterial pressure also reaches 40 mmHg but is not allowed to recover. Both models have similar mortality rates (80%) but differ in survival time and hemodynamic variables. The documents do not provide a direct answer to the question of how much blood loss causes hypotension. However, they do provide information on the amount of blood withdrawn in each model. In the first model, 31-32 ml/kg of blood is withdrawn to reduce arterial pressure to 40 mmHg. This suggests that blood loss of around 30% may be sufficient to cause hypotension.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
