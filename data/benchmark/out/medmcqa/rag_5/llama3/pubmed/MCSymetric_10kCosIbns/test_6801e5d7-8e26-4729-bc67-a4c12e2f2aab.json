["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the factors that can affect the setting time of zinc phosphate cements. From the provided documents, we know that the coefficient of setting speed was found to be dependent on environmental temperature (document 1). A decrease in P/L ratio also caused a decrease in setting time (document 1). Additionally, adding water to the cement did not affect working time but decreased setting time (document 2).\", \"answer_choice\": D}"]
