["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks for the maximum voltage of R wave. ECG shows a mean axis of 90 degrees. This indicates that the vector is in the horizontal plane. The normal ranges of angular velocity are given as: frontal plane, 46.2 radians/sec; horizontal plane, 41 radians/sec; and left sagittal plane, 34.1 radians/sec. Since the mean axis is 90 degrees, which corresponds to the horizontal plane, we look for the maximum value in this plane. According to the text, the average values of maximum angular velocities are: frontal plane, 46.2 radians/sec; horizontal plane, 41 radians/sec. Therefore, the maximum voltage of R wave would be present in...\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
