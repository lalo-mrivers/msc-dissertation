["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Since we are looking for the reason why masseter is a strong muscle, let's look at the relevant documents. The 'The orderly recruitment of motor units...' document doesn't mention anything about the arrangement of fibers in the masseter muscle. The 'Effect of muscle mass on the pressor response...' and 'Effect of the contraction of other muscle groups on muscle strength...' documents don't provide any information about the masseter muscle specifically. The 'A method for the estimation of striated muscle mass...' document is a method paper that doesn't provide any information about the masseter muscle either. The only relevant document is 'The metabolic homoeostatic role of muscle...'. It doesn't mention anything about the arrangement of fibers in the masseter muscle. So, we can safely say that none of the provided documents provide information about the arrangement of fibers in the masseter muscle.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"]
