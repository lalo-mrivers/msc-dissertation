["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the synthesis and supramolecular organization of components of the extracellular matrix by fibroblasts. Fibroblasts cultured in a collagen gel contract and organize the gel into a three-dimensional matrix of collagen fibers, producing main extracellular matrix components (collagen, noncollagen proteins, glycosaminoglycans) although in small amounts. No specific information about the secreted proteins in the cell-rich zone is provided.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
