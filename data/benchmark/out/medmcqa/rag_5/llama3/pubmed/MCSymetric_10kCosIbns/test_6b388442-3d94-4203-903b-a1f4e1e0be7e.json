["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the condition under which relining and rebasing can be done for a loose complete denture. Based on the provided documents, it is mentioned that during rebase of complete dentures, the denture bases are used as trays for making border molding and final impression. This process can cause the upper denture to shift forward and downward, damaging the occlusal relationship and esthetics. To correct this displacement, an effective method was introduced which utilizes the interridge distance, distance between the upper edentulous ridge and the occlusal surface of the lower acrylic teeth, and interocclusal records obtained immediately after each impression. This indicates that relining and rebasing can be done in a condition where there is some degree of displacement or shifting of the denture base.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
