["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents provided discuss various aspects of gutta-percha, including its ability to dissolve with certain essential oils, its use in apicoectomy, its biocompatibility, and its surface architecture. None of the documents mention the percentage composition of gutta-percha or zinc oxide (option A). Gutta-percha can be sterilized by heating as mentioned in the 'Gutta-percha points of apicoectomy' document. The document 'Surface architecture of a low-temperature thermoplasticized gutta-percha' discusses the changes in surface morphology with heat treatment, which implies that gutta-percha can be sterilized by heating (option B). Gutta-percha is known to become brittle over time as mentioned in the 'Gutta-percha points of apicoectomy' document. The documents do not discuss the existence of α and β forms of gutta-percha (option D). Therefore, none of the given options are entirely true.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
