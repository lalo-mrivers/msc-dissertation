["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Reviewing the provided documents, we can see that there is no direct correlation between valvular lesion and myocardial infarction. However, Case 1 from [Myocardial infarct following left ventriculography. Report of 2 cases and review of the literature] presents a boy who developed myocardial infarction as a consequence of angiocardiographic study and had a satisfactory clinic evolution. This suggests that in some cases, valvular lesions may be a trigger for myocardial infarction rather than the other way around. Case 2 from the same document also supports this notion, as the girl developed myocardial infarction following left ventriculography and died on the fourth day following the hemodynamic study. This suggests that there is a risk of developing myocardial infarction during valvular procedures. Therefore, it can be inferred that a valvular lesion may not necessarily result from myocardial infarction.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
