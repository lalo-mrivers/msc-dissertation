["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about characteristic features of Tricuspid Atresia. Since the provided documents are not related to cardiac anatomy or function, we cannot directly apply their information to answer this question. Therefore, we must rely on general medical knowledge and cardiac anatomy. Tricuspid atresia is a congenital heart defect characterized by an absent or severely stenotic tricuspid valve, which impairs blood flow between the right atrium and ventricle. Considering this, we can deduce that Pulmonary vascularity is not diminished because it is dependent on right ventricular function, which is not directly affected in Tricuspid Atresia. Splitting of S2 could be present due to the altered hemodynamics. Left Axis deviation might occur depending on the extent of cardiac enlargement and hypertrophy. Right ventricular hypoplasia seems likely given the characteristic features of Tricuspid atresia. In conclusion, we can identify Pulmonary vascularity is diminished as an incorrect feature.\", \"answer_choice\": B}"]
