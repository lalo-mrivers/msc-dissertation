["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the given documents, we can see that Plasmodium vivax has different stages. The strain of P. vivax from Thailand with a polymorphic repeat unit of the circumsporozoite protein was established in monkeys. This suggests that sporozoites are involved in the development of this strain. Additionally, the document 'Development of a polymorphic strain of Plasmodium vivax in monkeys' mentions successful transmission via sporozoite inoculation, indicating that sporozoites are infectious to mosquitoes. Therefore, the infective stage is likely to be the Sporozoite.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
