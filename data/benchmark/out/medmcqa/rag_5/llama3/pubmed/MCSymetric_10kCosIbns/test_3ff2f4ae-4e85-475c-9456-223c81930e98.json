["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents provided describe the morphology of enamel crystals, matrix-mineral relationships, and prism patterns. The key point is that the study on artificial carious enamel [A scanning electron microscopic study of surface layer changes in artificial carious enamel] describes direct crystal dissolution as a prominent feature. This suggests that the enamel crystallites may be susceptible to demineralization. Considering the ultrastructural studies of enamel crystallites, we can see that the thickness and width measurements are 263 A and 683 A, respectively. The growth curve of enamel crystallites was drawn, demonstrating an increase in lattice planes during enamel development. Fusions and dislocations related to maturation were visualized and discussed. Difficulties linked to ultrastructural techniques were mentioned. The question of the organic stroma of crystals remained unsettled. Therefore, based on these studies, it is reasonable to conclude that the pattern of enamel prism demineralization is such that both the head and tail are not resistant to dissolution.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
