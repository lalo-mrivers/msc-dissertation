["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The provided documents are about electrical properties of fibers and tissues. The Velocity of passive conductance in a branching fiber document seems to be the most relevant one as it discusses conduction velocity. However, there is no specific information about A α fibres in this document. Therefore, we cannot directly determine the electrical conductivity speed of A α fibres from this document. We need to look for other documents.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: 20-Oct\"\n}"]
