["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the treatment options for a 12-year-old boy with a symmetric, expansile cystic lesion in the proximal humerus. The documents provided describe various types of bone lesions, including solitary bone cysts and osteochondromas. However, none of these documents specifically discuss the treatment of a cystic lesion in the proximal humerus. Therefore, we must consider general principles of treating bone cysts. Curettage is often used to treat benign bone cysts, so this is a reasonable option. Intralesional steroids and sclerosing agents are also sometimes used to treat bone cysts, but their effectiveness may be limited in this case since the lesion is expansile and cystic. Radiotherapy is not typically used to treat benign bone cysts, especially in a pediatric patient.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
