["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"After reviewing the provided documents, I noticed that uterine contraction was studied in different hormonal conditions. The document [Hormonal regulation of uterine contraction] states that an activation of the uterine pacemaker was observed after oestrogenic loading, and a clear-cut progestinic block of contractile activity. This suggests that estrogen stimulates uterus contraction. Additionally, the same document mentions that oxytocin can induce hysterotonometry.\n\nThe document [Uterine activity in late pregnancy (author's transl)] discusses different types of uterine activity, including contractions and phases of inactivity, which are associated with delivery. The hormone regulating these activities is not explicitly stated but oxytocin is often mentioned as a stimulator of uterine contraction.\n\nThe document [Catecholamine levels and their distribution in the uterus during pregnancy and labor] studies catecholaminergic innervation of the myometrium, which is not directly related to hormone-induced uterine contractions.\n\nLastly, the document [Ultrasound assessment of puerperal uterine involution] discusses ultrasound measurements of postpartum uterus but does not provide information on hormone-induced uterine contraction.\n\nConsidering all this information, I conclude that estrogen stimulates uterus contraction and lets down milk. Therefore, I choose option A: Progesterone as the incorrect answer since progesterone has a progestinic block effect.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
