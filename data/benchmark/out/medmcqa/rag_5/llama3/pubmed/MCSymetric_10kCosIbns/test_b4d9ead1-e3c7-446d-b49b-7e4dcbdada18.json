["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about Golgi tendon organs. From the provided documents, there is no specific information on Golgi tendon organs. However, it is mentioned that the authors' concept on tendons as motor units is discussed in [Constitution and structure of human tendons]. This suggests that the tendons have a complex organization with reinforcing fibersystems. Furthermore, the study on experimental tendon sheath formation by free transplantation of a long vein segment does not mention Golgi tendon organs. The ultrastructural features of adult human tendons do not provide any information related to Golgi tendon organs either. Therefore, it is necessary to consult other relevant documents or research articles on the topic of Golgi tendon organs.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
