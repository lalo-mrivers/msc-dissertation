["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, it is clear that fluoride ions interact with hydroxyapatite crystals. From 'Surface properties of hydroxyapatite: I. The effect of various inorganic ions on the electrophoretic behavior', we know that fluoride ions increase the charge density and make the surface less prone to attack by acid or alkali. In 'The effect of NaF on the bacterial production of polysaccharide and subsequent adsorption on hydroxyapatite', it is mentioned that NaF can inhibit bacterial attachment and caries by interfering with bacterial attachment through reducing the production of water insoluble polysaccharide. From 'Surface adsorption of fluoride and ionic exchange reactions on hydroxyapatite', we know that a part of the fluoride which was taken up by hydroxyapatite or teeth at low concentrations of fluoride at neutral pH was soluble in alkali (IN KOH, 24 h) and was thus not fluoroapatite. This suggests that fluoride ions can substitute for other ions on the surface of hydroxyapatite crystals.\", \n\"answer_choice\": \"D: None\"\n}"]
