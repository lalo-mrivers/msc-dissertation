["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The provided documents describe various surgical techniques and wound complications. The most relevant information is found in the first document, [Skin incisions in inguinal lymph-node excision], which describes a specific type of skin incision for inguinal lymph node dissection. This technique involves an oblique, subinguinal, wide spindle-S-shaped skin excision crossing over Scarpa's triangle with an extension to the anterior superior iliac spine from its lateral end and a vertical prolongation onto the thigh from its medial end.

No muscle splitting is mentioned in this technique. In the other documents, no mention is made of a specific type of skin incision or muscle splitting.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
