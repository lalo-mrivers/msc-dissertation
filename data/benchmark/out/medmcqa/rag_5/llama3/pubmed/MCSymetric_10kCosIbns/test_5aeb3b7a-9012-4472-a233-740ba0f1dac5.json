["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about disease modifying anti-rheumatoid drugs (DMARD) that acts by increasing extracellular adenosine. The documents provided are related to adenosine and its cardiovascular effects, as well as DMARDs. The only relevant information is from the document 'Mechanisms of action of disease modifying antirheumatic drugs', which mentions that some DMARDs inhibit immune responses of monocytes and T and B lymphocytes. Adenosine increases extracellular adenosine by inhibiting its reuptake. Therefore, we need to find a DMARD that acts similarly. According to the same document, methotrexate affects various phagocytic cell functions and inhibits immune responses of monocytes and T and B lymphocytes. This is similar to how adenosine increases extracellular adenosine by inhibiting its reuptake.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
