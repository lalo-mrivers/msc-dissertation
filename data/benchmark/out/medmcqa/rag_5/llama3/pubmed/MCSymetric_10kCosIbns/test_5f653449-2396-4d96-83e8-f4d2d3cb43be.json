["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the process of transferring information from RNA to proteins. After reviewing the provided documents, I see that the key concept related to this process is genetic coding and protein synthesis. Specifically, the document 'Origin of genetically encoded protein synthesis: a model based on selection for RNA peptidation' discusses the origin of genetic encoding and the functional advantages derived from post-transcriptional addition of peptide cofactors to RNA apo-catalysts. This implies that the information transfer occurs through protein synthesis, which is facilitated by ribosomal interactions and molecular evolution.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
