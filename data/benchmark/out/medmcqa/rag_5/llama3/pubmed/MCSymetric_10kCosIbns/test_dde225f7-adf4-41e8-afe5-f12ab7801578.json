["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents mention several studies on x-ray filters made of heavy elements. One study mentions that a combined niobium/aluminum filter provides substantial reduction of entrance skin exposure. Another study shows that lead foil (0.55 gcm-2) provided the best overall improvement in buildup and depth-dose characteristics by removing electrons from the beam. Additionally, the document on CT scanners mentions that source filter materials with an atomic number from 29 to 40 are optimum, including aluminum. Based on this information, it can be inferred that the principal reason for placing an aluminium filter in the primary beam of radiation is to reduce radiation to the skin of the patient.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"]
