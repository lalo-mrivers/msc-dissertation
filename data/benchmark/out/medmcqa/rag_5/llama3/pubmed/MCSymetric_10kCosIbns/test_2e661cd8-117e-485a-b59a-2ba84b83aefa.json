["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the radiograph of a periodontal ligament of a tooth which has lost its antagonist. The key point here is that the tooth has lost its antagonist, which means it no longer has to withstand the forces generated by biting or chewing. This suggests that the PDL space might be affected, as it plays a crucial role in cushioning the tooth during mastication. In healthy periodontal tissues, radiographic signs such as wedge-shaped widening of the periodontal ligament space at the bone crest are commonly seen on teeth with normal periodontium (reference: [Radiographic analysis of normal periodontal tissues]). Given that the tooth has lost its antagonist, it is likely that the PDL space would widen in this case.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
