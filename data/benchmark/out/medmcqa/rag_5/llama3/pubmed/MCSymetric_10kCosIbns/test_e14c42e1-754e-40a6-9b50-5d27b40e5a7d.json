["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the given documents, we can see that papain digestion of IgG proteins results in the formation of Fab fragments. The Characterization of two species of Fc fragments obtained from rat IgG2a by prolonged papain digestion shows that prolonged papain digestion leads to the formation of Fc and Fab fragments. Additionally, the isolation of normal human IgA, IgM and fragments of papain-digested human IgG also suggests that papain digestion results in the formation of Fab fragments. Therefore, it can be concluded that hydrolysis of IgG with papain will lead to the formation of 1 Fc and 2 Fab fragments.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
