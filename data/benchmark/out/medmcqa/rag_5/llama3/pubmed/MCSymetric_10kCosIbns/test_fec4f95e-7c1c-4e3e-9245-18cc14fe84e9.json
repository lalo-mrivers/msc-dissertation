["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about increasing acetylcholine release from the presynaptic membrane. In the given documents, we see that depolarization with high K+ or 4-aminopyridine increases the released [3H]ACh, whereas conditions that inhibit choline transport (HC-3, McN-A-343, and 'no sodium') increase both the residing and released [3H]ACh. This suggests that blocking voltage-gated channels can increase acetylcholine release.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
