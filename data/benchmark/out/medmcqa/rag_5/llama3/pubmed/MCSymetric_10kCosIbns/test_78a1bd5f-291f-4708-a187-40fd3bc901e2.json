["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, we know that skin lesions can be puzzling when the primary tumor is silent or unrecognized. Tumors that masquerade as benign growths can allow a covert malignancy to remain undetected for a long time unless histologic sections are examined. Most secondary skin lesions do not require treatment. The exceptions are inflammatory, painful, or ulcerating neoplasms and relatively slow-growing tumors that yield to simple measures--i.e., surgical excision and/or radiotherapy. This suggests that the spread of primary cancer to the skin is typically a metastatic process rather than local invasion. Furthermore, the documents describe various types of epithelial skin tumours and their characteristics. This information can help us identify the type of carcinoma that spreads by local invasion and has no tendency to metastasise.\n\nFrom the provided options, we know that Basal cell carcinoma (B) is a type of epithelial skin tumour that typically spreads through local invasion rather than metastasis. Therefore, it is likely the correct answer.\", \n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
