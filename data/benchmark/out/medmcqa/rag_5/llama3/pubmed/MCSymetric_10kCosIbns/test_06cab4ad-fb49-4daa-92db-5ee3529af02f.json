["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the functions of muscles that move the mandible, including their speed of closure. The Biologic laws governing functions of muscles that move the mandible specify that the character of the occlusal surfaces of teeth programs the functions of muscles that move the mandible. This suggests that the movement of the mandible is influenced by the shape and position of the teeth. The documents do not explicitly discuss retraction of the mandible, but they do mention the movements of the mandible. Based on this information, we can infer that the retraction of the mandible is likely achieved through a combination of muscle actions.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
