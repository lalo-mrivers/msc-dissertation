["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question states that complete denture teeth are in edge-to-edge contact in centric occlusion. This suggests a lack of space between the upper and lower dentures. To resolve this issue, we need to consider the spatial interarch relationship between the residual edentulous ridge and the antagonist natural teeth in the buccolingual plane, as described in the first document. It is mentioned that the crest of the residual ridge is lingually placed compared to the occlusal surfaces of the antagonist teeth. This means that there is a tendency for the denture teeth to be placed far buccally and away from the crest of the residual ridge.\n\nIn the maxilla, the positioning of the artificial teeth in the area previously occupied by the natural extracted teeth will place the denture teeth far buccal as well as away from the crest of the residual ridge. This suggests that some adjustments are necessary to achieve a more favorable spatial relationship between the denture and natural teeth.\n\nThe fourth document discusses the integration of restorations with existent partial dentures, which is relevant in this context because it highlights the importance of maintaining the correct configuration of supporting teeth for proper function. The technique described in this document involves restoring the natural supportive enamel to ensure the function of the rest or clasp is restored.\n\nBased on these considerations, we can conclude that the issue at hand is related to the spatial relationship between the denture and natural teeth rather than the shape of individual teeth. Therefore, grinding the centric holding cusp (A) does not seem to be a relevant solution in this context. The other options all involve adjusting the shape or position of the denture teeth to achieve a more favorable spatial relationship with the natural teeth.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
