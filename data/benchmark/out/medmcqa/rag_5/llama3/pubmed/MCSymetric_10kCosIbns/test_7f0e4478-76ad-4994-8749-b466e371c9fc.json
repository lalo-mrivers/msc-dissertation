["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the main arterial trunk supplying the infra temporal fossa. Let's review the documents provided. The first document describes the superficial temporal artery (STA) and its branches. It mentions that the frontal ramus of the STA is larger than the parietal one, but it does not specifically mention the infra-temporal fossa. The second document is about angiographic studies of the posterior cerebral artery and its branches, which do not relate to the infra-temporal fossa either. The third document describes the functional anatomy of the superficial temporal blood vessels, including their territories on the scalp, face, and ear. It also mentions a rich anastomotic system in the fascia superficilialis. However, it does not provide information about the main arterial trunk supplying the infra-temporal fossa.\n\nThe fourth document is about the anterior chorioidal artery and the posterior communicating artery in traumatic lesions of the middle cranial fossa. It describes five types of dislocation of the temporal lobe that can be differentiated by angiographic demonstration of these arteries. Again, it does not provide information about the infra-temporal fossa.\n\nThe fifth document is about the drainage of the scalp by the superficial temporal vein and its surgical implications. While it provides detailed information about the venous network draining into the superficial temporal v., it does not mention the arterial supply to the infra-temporal fossa.\n\nIn conclusion, the provided documents do not contain specific information about the main arterial trunk supplying the infra-temporal fossa.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
