["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the effects of early fusion of the coronal suture. Based on the document 'Craniofacial growth following experimental craniosynostosis and craniectomy in rabbits', it can be seen that premature fusion of the coronal suture resulted in skull deformity, specifically anteroposterior shortening. This suggests that early fusion of the coronal suture results in a type of brachycephaly (shortening of the skull).\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
