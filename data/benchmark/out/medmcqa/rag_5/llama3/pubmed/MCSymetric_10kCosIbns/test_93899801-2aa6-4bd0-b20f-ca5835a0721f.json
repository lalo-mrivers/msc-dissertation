["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The key document here is 'Airway management in the blunt trauma patient...' which states that oral intubation is hazardous in the presence of an unstable injury to the cervical spine. This suggests that traditional orotracheal intubation may not be the preferred method for airway management in this situation. Instead, we should consider alternative methods that minimize the risk of exacerbating a potential spinal cord injury. The article 'Anesthetic management of neck trauma...' mentions that multiple injuries were noted in the blunt trauma series, which further emphasizes the need for caution when managing the airway.\n\nThe document '[Anesthesia of patients with injury to the cervical spine]...' provides detailed guidance on the management of patients with cervical spine injuries. It highlights the potential risks associated with oral intubation and recommends tracheal intubation under fibroscopic control as a safer alternative. This suggests that oral intubation should be avoided in favor of an alternative method that minimizes the risk of exacerbating spinal cord injury.\n\nFinally, 'Managing the airway in cervical spine injury...' provides a comprehensive review of the Advanced Trauma Life Support protocol for managing the airway in patients with cervical spine injuries. It emphasizes the importance of caution when managing the airway in these patients and recommends alternative methods such as nasotracheal intubation or LMA.\n\nBased on this analysis, I believe that the preferred method of intubation would be D: Fiberoptic intubation under fibroscopic control, which minimizes the risk of exacerbating spinal cord injury and provides a safer alternative to traditional oral intubation.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
