["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the primitive palate formation. The provided documents discuss secondary palate development in various species. From the study on human autopsy material, we know that palatal growth and morphology change with age. In rats, graphic reconstructions show changes in craniofacial structures during secondary palate development. For the primitive palate formation, we need to look at embryonic development. According to [Scanning electron microscope study of the secondary palate during embryonic formation in the rat], the median and posterior region of the palate is formed by the elevation of lateral palatine processus from a ventro-medial to a horizontal position, followed by their adhesion.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
