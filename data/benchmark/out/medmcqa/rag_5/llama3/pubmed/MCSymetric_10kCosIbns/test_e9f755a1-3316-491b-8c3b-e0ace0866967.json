["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about a patient who has been wearing a distal extension partial denture for 3 weeks and is experiencing sensitivity to chewing pressure. The relevant documents mention issues related to complete dentures, but we can apply the principles to partial dentures as well. We can rule out options B and D because they are specific to the type of restoration used (clasp or cement base) which is not mentioned in the question. Option A, improper occlusion, could be a possibility since it affects masticatory performance, but we need more information. The most likely reason for sensitivity to chewing pressure would be tissue pressure under the denture.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
