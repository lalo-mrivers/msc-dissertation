["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The child spent 8 years of life in a temperate climate where the drinking water had fluoride of 3 ppm. This suggests that the child's teeth were exposed to optimal levels of fluoride during this time. According to the documents, optimal accounts of fluoride are available when the fluoride concentration is around 1.00 ppm F-. However, since the child's teeth were exposed to 3 ppm of fluoride, it can be inferred that the enamel in their deciduous teeth would have a higher fluoride content compared to those from areas without fluoridation (as shown in [Fluoride concentration of drinking water and fluoride content of the enamel in deciduous teeth]). This suggests that the child's primary teeth would likely be affected by the optimal levels of fluoride. The question also asks about the effects on permanent teeth, but since the child spent 8 years in an area with fluoridated drinking water, it can be assumed that the permanent teeth would also have been exposed to optimal levels of fluoride during their development.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C\n}"]
