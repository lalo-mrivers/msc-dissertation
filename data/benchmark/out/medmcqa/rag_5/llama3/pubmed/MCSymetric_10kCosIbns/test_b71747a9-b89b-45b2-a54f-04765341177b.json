["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The provided documents discuss the anticholinergic activity of various drugs. Central versus peripheral anticholinergic activity as assessed by two in vivo procedures in mice suggests that atropine sulfate and scopolamine hydrobromide primarily measure CNS anticholinergic activity, whereas tertiary and quaternary anticholinergic drugs were compared in two different test procedures designed to measure cholinolytic activity in mice. The results led to the conclusion that one of these test procedures, the induction of mydriasis (increase in pupil size), primarily measures peripheral anticholinergic activity. We know that glycopyrrolate is a quaternary ammonium compound which does not cross the blood brain barrier. Therefore, we can conclude that A: Glycopyrrolate is the correct answer.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
