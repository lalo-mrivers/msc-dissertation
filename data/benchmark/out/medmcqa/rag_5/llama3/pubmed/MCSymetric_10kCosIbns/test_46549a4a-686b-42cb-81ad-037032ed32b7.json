["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about high Cu alloys, which are mentioned in multiple studies. The first study discusses the high temperature oxidation of noble metal alloys with small additions of alloying elements like Zn, Mg, Si, Be, and Al. The second study evaluates the metallurgical properties of a copper-based alloy for dental castings. The third study investigates the behavior of three high-Cu amalgams. None of these studies explicitly mention the tensile strength, creep, or corrosion resistance of high Cu alloys. However, based on the information provided, it can be inferred that high Cu alloys are susceptible to high temperature oxidation and corrosion.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: None of the above\"\n}"]
