["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the cause of mouth-opening limitation due to a depressed zygomatic arch fracture. The relevant documents suggest that interferences between the coronoid process and bone walls of the zygomatic arch can be a cause of extra-ankylotic mouth-opening limitation. A depressed zygomatic arch fracture would likely involve impingement of the coronoid process, which is supported by the document '[Mouth oepening limitations due to coronoid-zygomatic-malar interference]', stating that 'the event [of mouth-opening limitation] is rare and once correct diagnosis has been made there are excellent opportunities for treatment, largely of surgical nature. The zygomatic-malar area or coronoid process will be operated on depending on the case.'\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
