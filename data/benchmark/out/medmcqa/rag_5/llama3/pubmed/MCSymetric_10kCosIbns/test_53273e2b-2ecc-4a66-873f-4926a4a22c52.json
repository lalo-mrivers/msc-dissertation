["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks for the enzyme involved in gluconeogenesis that is all except the options provided. Let's review the documents... In the first document, it talks about gluconeogenesis enzymes in human liver tissue. It mentions phosphoenolpyruvate carboxinase, fructoso-1,6-siphosphatase, and glucoso-6-phosphatase as key enzymes involved in gluconeogenesis. None of these enzymes match the options provided. Therefore, I will focus on the second document... Here, it talks about the activity of glucogenesis key enzymes (phosphoenolpyruvate carboxkinase, fructoso-1,6-diphosphatase, and glucoso-6-phosphatase) in rat liver and kidneys. Again, none of these enzymes match the options provided... The third document discusses a selective system for hepatoma cells producing gluconeogenic enzymes. It mentions phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, fructose diphosphatase, and triokinase as relevant enzymes involved in gluconeogenesis. None of these enzymes match the options provided... The last two documents discuss various methods to study gluconeogenesis. They do not provide information on specific enzymes involved in gluconeogenesis.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
