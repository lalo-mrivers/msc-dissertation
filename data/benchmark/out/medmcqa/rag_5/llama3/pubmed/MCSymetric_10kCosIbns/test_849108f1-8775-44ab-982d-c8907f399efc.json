["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is 16 years old with primary amenorrhea. She started developing breast at the age of 12. The prescription of OCPs by a doctor 2 years back had no effect. On examination, breasts are well developed (Tanner's stage 5) and pubic hair is minimal (Tanner's stage 1). This suggests that the patient has normal secondary sexual characteristics but delayed primary sexual development. Given the history of breast development at an early age and lack of response to OCPs, it is unlikely that she has premature ovarian failure or Turner's syndrome. The presence of well-developed breasts with minimal pubic hair also makes Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome less likely.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
