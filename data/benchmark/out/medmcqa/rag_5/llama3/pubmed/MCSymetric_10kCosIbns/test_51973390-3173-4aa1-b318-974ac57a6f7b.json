["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the suitable technique used for diagnosis of posterior interproximal caries in children. From the provided documents, we can see that bite-wing X-rays are mentioned as a method for detecting caries in [Experimental studies on the radiographic presentation of proximal caries in the lateral region]. Additionally, in [An in vivo comparison of radiographic and directly assessed clinical caries status of posterior approximal surfaces in primary and permanent teeth], bite-wing radiographs were used to compare with direct visual examination. Therefore, it is likely that bite-wing X-rays are a suitable technique for diagnosing posterior interproximal caries in children.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
