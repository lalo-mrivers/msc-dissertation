["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The cusp writer is a teaching aid used to facilitate understanding of the correlation between cusp angulation and the various occlusal determinants. According to part II of the 'Application of \"cusp writer\" findings to practical and theoretical occlusal problems', the steepness of the curve of Spee determines the relative cusp height and angulation of one tooth to another, from an anterior to a posterior direction in the dental arch. Additionally, the steeper the curve of Spee, the more irregular the cusp height and angulations are with steeper anterior cusps and flatter posterior cusps.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
