["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents mention reversible hydrocolloids, which can transform from sol to gel and back to sol. The transformation is temperature-dependent, as mentioned in the third document: 'High-altitude boiling of reversible hydrocolloid in water alone is inadequate. It must be liquefied at a temperature of at least 100 degrees C.' This suggests that the property by which this transformation occurs is a function of the Temperature.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
