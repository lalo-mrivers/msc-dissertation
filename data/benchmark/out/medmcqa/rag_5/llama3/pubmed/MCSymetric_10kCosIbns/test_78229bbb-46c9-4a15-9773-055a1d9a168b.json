["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the smallest mesiodistal diameter. Mesiodistal diameter refers to the width of a tooth from front to back. Based on the provided documents, none of them mention anything about teeth or their dimensions. Therefore, we need to rely on general dental knowledge.
