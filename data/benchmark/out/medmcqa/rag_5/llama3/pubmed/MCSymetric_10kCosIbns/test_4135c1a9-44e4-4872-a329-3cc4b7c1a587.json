["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks which characteristic is common to both zinc eugenol cement and polycarboxylate cement. The documents describe the properties of four dental cements: zinc phosphate, polycarboxylate, two modified zinc oxide eugenol materials. The documents highlight significant differences in the retentive property between these cements. Polycarboxylate cement is the only material that fractured partially or wholly within the cement film. Zinc oxide eugenol (modified) mostly adhered to the inlay. Compressive strength for a zinc oxide eugenol cement is negatively skewed, but normal after removing outlying results.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
