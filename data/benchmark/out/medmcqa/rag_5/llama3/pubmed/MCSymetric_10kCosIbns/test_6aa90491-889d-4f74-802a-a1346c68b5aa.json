["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for the lower limit of the average that can be expected 95% of times. The distribution of IOP is given as an average of 30 mm with an SD of 1. This is a normal distribution. Using the z-score formula, we can calculate the z-score corresponding to the 2.5th percentile (lower limit for 95% confidence interval). Since there are no values provided in the text that would help us directly calculate the z-score, we will use the standard deviation of 3.2 mmHg from one of the other texts to approximate the SD. Using this value, we can estimate the z-score and then find the corresponding IOP value.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
