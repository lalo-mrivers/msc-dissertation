["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to the provided documents, it can be seen that low molecular weight heparins (LMWH) have a specific biological and pharmacokinetic properties. It is mentioned that LMWH has greater inhibition of factor Xa than thrombin activity, which suggests that LMWH has reliable anticoagulant action due to its ability to inhibit factor Xa. This is further supported by the fact that anti-Xa/anti-IIa ratio varies according to low molecular weight heparin preparations from 2.5 to 10, while it is invariably 1 for standard heparin.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
