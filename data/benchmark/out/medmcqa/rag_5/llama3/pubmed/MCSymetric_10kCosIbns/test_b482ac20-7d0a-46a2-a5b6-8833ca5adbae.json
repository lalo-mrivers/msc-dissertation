["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the unique anticariogenic property of most silicate cements. The relevant document that provides information on this topic is 'Silica-induced precipitation of calcium phosphate in the presence of inhibitors of hydroxyapatite formation'. This document suggests that silica can stimulate precipitation, and that the effects of bacterial inhibitors can be partially overcome in the presence of silica. Therefore, the unique anticariogenic property of most silicate cements is due to their ability to promote precipitation.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
