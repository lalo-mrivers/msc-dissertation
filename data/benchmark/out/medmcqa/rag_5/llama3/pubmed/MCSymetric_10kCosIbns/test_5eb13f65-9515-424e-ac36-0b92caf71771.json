["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the treatment options for SCC (squamous cell carcinoma) present on the lateral margin of the tongue with staging T2N0. The staging indicates that there are no distant metastases and the primary tumor is 2 cm or less in greatest dimension. Since it's a T2 lesion, surgery might be an option. According to the documents, surgical treatment of advanced carcinomas of the base of the tongue involves various procedures including neck dissection. Therefore, we need to focus on the neck dissection options provided. The documents also mention that 28 out of 34 patients (82.3%) presented with clinically positive cervical nodal metastases in a study about surgical treatment of advanced carcinomas of the base of the tongue. This suggests that neck dissection might be necessary for this type of tumor. Since there are no distant metastases, we can focus on the regional lymph nodes.\n\nThe document 'Surgical treatment of carcinoma of the soft and fixed parts of the tongue' does not provide specific information about neck dissection techniques or options. However, it does mention that a logical and thoughtful approach is required to augment all tissues removed during surgery. This suggests that a thorough discussion of the tumor's extent and the surgical options available would be necessary before making a treatment decision.\n\nGiven the staging and the possible need for neck dissection, the most relevant document is 'Staging and prognostic factors in carcinoma of the base of the tongue'. This study does not provide specific information about neck dissection techniques or options. However, it does mention that 59 out of 66 patients were treated with radiotherapy alone, which suggests that surgery might be an option for this type of tumor.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the provided documents, we can infer that neck dissection might be necessary for a T2N0 SCC present on the lateral margin of the tongue. The options provided are SOHND (supraomohyoid neck dissections), Remove Lymph node I-II along with, Remove Lymph node I-V along with, and Remove Lymph node I-IV along with.\n\nThe most relevant document does not provide specific information about neck dissection techniques or options. However, it suggests that surgery might be an option for this type of tumor. Therefore, the treatment options should focus on surgical procedures including neck dissection.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A: SOHND (supraomohyoid neck dissections)\""]
