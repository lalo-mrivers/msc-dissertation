["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe congenitally missing teeth, tooth decay and extraction, wisdom teeth, and organic tooth wear. None of these topics directly mention the most commonly missing tooth. However, one document does mention that 'Both the upper and lower right or left 6th teeth (i.e. those in the middle position) were most commonly affected in males and females' in a study on tooth decay and extraction.
