["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"After reviewing the provided documents, it can be seen that Citrate Phosphate Dextrose (CPD) is mentioned as a suitable preservative solution for storing blood. Specifically, [Methods of sampling and preservation of blood used during extracorporeal circulation] states that CPD answers to requirements in terms of respiratory function of red blood cells when the blood used is less than 48 hours old. Additionally, [Storage of blood and the mean corpuscular volume] shows that blood stored in CPD solution for up to 24 days did not show significant change in MCV.
