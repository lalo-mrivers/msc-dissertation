["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the structure and function of glomerular capillaries. The electron-microscopic examination reveals thin intercapillary anastomoses with a wall structure similar to remaining glomerular capillaries. The primary filtration barrier is considered to be the basement membrane, supported by experimental evidence obtained with particulate tracers such as ferritin and dextrans. Glomerular permeability for plasma proteins and erythrocytes depends on the fine structure of the glomerular capillary wall and functional components obtained from blood. There are minimal 'defects' in the glomerular capillary membrane that can increase under pathological conditions, but these defects are different from the ones caused by charge defects.\n\nConsidering this information, we need to evaluate the options: A) The oncotic pressure of the fluid leaving the capillaries is less than that of fluid entering it. This statement is true, as the glomerular filtration barrier functions by allowing small molecules to pass through while retaining larger ones, including proteins and other solutes.\n\nB) Glucose concentration in the capillaries is the same as that in glomerular filtrate. This statement is true, as glucose is a small molecule that can easily pass through the glomerular filtration barrier.\n\nC) Constriction of afferent aeriole decreases the blood flow to the glomerulus. This statement is not explicitly stated in the documents, but it seems plausible based on general knowledge of renal hemodynamics and the anatomy of the glomerulus.\n\nD) Hematocrit of the fluid leaving the capillaries is less than that of the fluid entering it. This statement is true, as erythrocytes are larger molecules that can be retained by the glomerular filtration barrier.\n\nTherefore, option C is not true about glomerular capillaries.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
