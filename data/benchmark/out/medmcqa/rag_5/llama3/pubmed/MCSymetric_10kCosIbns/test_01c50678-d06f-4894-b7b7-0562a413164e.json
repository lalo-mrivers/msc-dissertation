["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents mention the importance of filler particle size and hardness in determining polishability. According to 'Surface roughness of composite filling materials', optimization in the filler particles from the point of view of polishability also results in improved wear resistance to toothbrushing. This suggests that soft matrix and hard filler particles can affect the polishing process. Furthermore, 'Relationship between abrasive wear and microstructure of composite resins' states that abrasion rates are dependent upon the size, hardness, and volume fraction of particles in the material. This supports the idea that hard filler particles can influence polishing.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A: Soft matrix and hard filler particles\"\n}"]
