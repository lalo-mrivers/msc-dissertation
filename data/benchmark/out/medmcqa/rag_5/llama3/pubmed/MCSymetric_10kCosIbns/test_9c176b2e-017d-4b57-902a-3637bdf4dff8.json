["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"This question is related to the topic of airway constriction, but the provided documents do not directly discuss the effects of efferent aeriole constriction on glomerular filtration rate (GFR), glomerular hydrostatic pressure, or oncotic pressure in peritubular vessels. The documents primarily focus on the mechanics of soft tissue and lung tissue resistance during contractile stimulation.\n\nHowever, one document discusses the relationship between the major site of airway constriction and change in total pulmonary resistance while breathing gases of varying density and viscosity. This information can be used to think step-by-step about the effects of efferent aeriole constriction on blood flow in peritubular vessels.\n\nThe relevant document suggests that tracheal banding produced a purely central resistance increase, which supports theoretical predictions that the predominant site of airways constriction can be determined without an airway catheter by comparing relative changes in total pulmonary resistance using different flow regimes. This information can be used to infer that efferent aeriole constriction may affect blood flow in peritubular vessels.\n\nThe question does not provide any information about the effects of efferent aeriole constriction on GFR, glomerular hydrostatic pressure, or oncotic pressure in peritubular vessels. Therefore, it is necessary to consult other sources of information to answer this question.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"]
