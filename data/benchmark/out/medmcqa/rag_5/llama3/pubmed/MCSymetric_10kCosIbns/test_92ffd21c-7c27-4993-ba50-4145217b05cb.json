["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, we can identify that dengue shock syndrome is a serious variant of dengue hemorrhagic fever. The documents describe various signs and symptoms associated with this condition, including subnormal concentrations of complement factor 3 in patients with primary infections, changes in immunity and blood parameters such as decreased complement activity, platelet counts, and neutrophil counts, as well as the presence of circulating immune complexes. We can also see that management of dengue shock syndrome involves fluid replacement therapy and careful monitoring. From this information, we can exclude hepatomegaly from being a characteristic sign of dengue shock syndrome since it is only mentioned as one of the digestive symptoms common in patients with dengue haemorrhagic fever/dengue shock syndrome. Pleural effusion is not mentioned at all in the provided documents. Thrombocytopenia is actually described as one of the laboratory findings in patients with dengue haemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome. Finally, decreased haemoglobin is not explicitly stated as a characteristic sign of dengue shock syndrome either.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
