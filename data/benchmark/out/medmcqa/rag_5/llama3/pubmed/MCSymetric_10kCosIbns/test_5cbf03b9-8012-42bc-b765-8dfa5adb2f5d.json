["{\n    \"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents mention lingual pedicle, lingual flange design, sublingual crescent extension, and the use of an acrylic plate device. The question is about the indication for lingual plates. From the given options, it can be inferred that lingual plate is not indicated by the presence of a need for addition of one or more anterior teeth (Option A), as this would typically require a different type of prosthetic device. Similarly, it is not related to good ridge support (Option C). The other options, B and D, seem relevant, but based on the provided documents, it seems that Option D, 'Narrow lingual sulcus', is the most fitting answer. This is because lingual pedicle and sublingual crescent extension are mentioned in the context of dentures, and a narrow lingual sulcus could be a factor contributing to the need for these types of prosthetics.\",\n    \"answer_choice\": D\n}"]
