["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about cardiac defects characterized by ductus-dependent blood flow. The concept of ductus-dependent blood flow refers to the reliance on the ductus arteriosus (a natural shunt that connects the aorta to the pulmonary artery) for circulation in certain congenital heart defects. This is typically seen in conditions where there is obstruction or restriction to blood flow through the pulmonary valve or right ventricle.\n\nConsidering the given options, transposition of great arteries with intact septum does not necessarily rely on ductus-dependent blood flow. In this condition, the aorta and pulmonary artery arise from inappropriate ventricles, but the outflow tracts still originate from the left ventricle.\n\nInterrupted aortic arch, truncus arteriosus, and hypoplastic left heart syndrome all involve some degree of obstruction or restriction to blood flow through the pulmonary valve or right ventricle, making them ductus-dependent conditions.\", \"answer_choice\": B}"]
