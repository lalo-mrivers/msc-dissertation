["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks which of the provided options is an obligate intracellular parasite. Obligate means that these organisms cannot survive outside of a host cell. The relevant documents provide information about Protista and their interactions with host cells, but they do not specifically mention obligate intracellular parasites among the given choices. However, we can look at each option to see if any of them are mentioned as being obligate or having an obligatory phase in their life cycle.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom the provided documents, it is stated that 'The Sporozoa are nearly all intracellular at some stage of their life... and the Microspora entirely so.' Additionally, Plasmodium infections involve some degree of competition with the host cell's metabolism as well as erosion of host cell cytoplasm.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow let us look at each option:\\r\\nA: Tropheryma whippelii - Not mentioned in the documents as an obligate intracellular parasite.\\r\\nB: Baonella henselae - Not mentioned in the documents as an obligate intracellular parasite.\\r\\nC: Ehrlichia chaffeensis - Not mentioned in the documents as an obligate intracellular parasite.\\r\\nD: Coxiella burnetii - This microorganism is often referred to as an obligate intracellular parasite due to its inability to survive outside of a host cell.\\r\\n\\r\\nTherefore, the correct answer choice is D.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
