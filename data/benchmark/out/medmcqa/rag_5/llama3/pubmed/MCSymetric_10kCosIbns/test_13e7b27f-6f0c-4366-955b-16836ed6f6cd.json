["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking which anticoagulant is used for electrolyte estimation. The relevant documents mention EDTA-coated tubes being suitable for the measurement of peptide hormones, steroid hormones, folic acid, and cyclic AMP in the same blood sample. This suggests that EDTA may be an option for electrolyte estimation. Additionally, the document [Determination of electrolytes in serum and plasma] mentions the use of ion-selective electrodes without dilution of the sample for determining the concentration of the 'ionized' or 'free' fraction of sodium, potassium, calcium, and magnesium in serum water. This method is applicable with a balanced combination of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) salts. Therefore, EDTA is a suitable anticoagulant for electrolyte estimation.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
