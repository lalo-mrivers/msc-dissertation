["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant document about chickenpox during pregnancy suggests that the authors report a case of chickenpox exposure during the first three months of pregnancy. Ultrasonographic monitoring of the fetus revealed signs of fetal infection starting from 32 weeks of amenorrhea (hepatomegaly, ascites, pleural effusion) but clinical examination of the child at birth showed nothing abnormal. The diagnosis was confirmed by the development of herpes zoster in the child after birth. This suggests that there is a risk of transmission to the fetus during pregnancy.\n\nThe case report about complications of chickenpox does not provide relevant information for this question.\n\nAbscess formation as a complication of chickenpox and ABO blood groups do not seem to be directly related to this scenario.\n\nABO blood groups and chicken pox in an Indian population suggests that subjects of blood group A (and possibly AB) would appear to have a somewhat higher risk than persons with group B and O to develop chicken pox, but it does not provide specific information about transmission during pregnancy or neonatal varicella syndrome. Therefore, the most relevant document is the one about chickenpox during pregnancy.\n\nIn this case, since the lady acquires chickenpox 3 days prior to delivery, there is a risk of transmitting the virus to the baby. The relevant document suggests that signs of fetal infection can be detected by ultrasonography, and confirmed by the development of herpes zoster in the child after birth. Therefore, we expect the baby to develop neonatal varicella syndrome.\n\nThe other options do not seem to be directly related to this scenario or supported by the provided documents.\", \n\"answer_choice\": D"]
