["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to the pharmacokinetic studies provided, isosorbide mononitrate reaches peak concentrations within an hour after oral administration. The half-life is approximately 5 hours, which means that the drug stays in the system for a relatively short period of time. Asymmetrical dosing creates irregular changes in plasma concentrations and a fall below a critical threshold level during the night, preventing tolerance from developing. This suggests that the preferred dosage form of isosorbide mononitrate is one that provides antianginal efficacy for at least 12 hours.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
