["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about a Rh-negative mother who has received Anti-D during 28 weeks of pregnancy. The Indirect Coombs Test (ICT) was negative. This suggests that the mother is not sensitized to the Rh factor and therefore no anti-D antibodies are present. Since the ICT was negative, it means there is no hemolytic disease in the newborn.
