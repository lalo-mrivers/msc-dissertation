["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the provided documents, we can infer that vasodilation is caused by the release of nitric oxide (NO) or the activation of potassium channels on endothelial cells. This is evident from the discussion of vasodilators and their mechanisms in [Afterload reduction and cardiac performance] and [Flow activates an endothelial potassium channel to release an endogenous nitrovasodilator]. Additionally, the document [Mechanism underlying the response to vasodilator nerve stimulation in isolated dog and monkey cerebral arteries] suggests that chemical and electrical stimulation of vasodilator nerves relaxes dog and monkey cerebral arteries, possibly by a mediation of NO.\n\nFurthermore, the document [Summation of arterial pressure responses to simultaneous stimulation of the central ends of the two vagus nerves] discusses the autoregulation mechanism of the vasomotor center, which is not directly related to vasodilation. Therefore, we can conclude that none of the options A, B, C, or D are correct.\n\nHowever, the documents suggest that substances such as nitrates, nitroprusside, and prazosin cause vasodilation by releasing NO or activating potassium channels on endothelial cells.\", \"answer_choice\": \"None of the above\""]
