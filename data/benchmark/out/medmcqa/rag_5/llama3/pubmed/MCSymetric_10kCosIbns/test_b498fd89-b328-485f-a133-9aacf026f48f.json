["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks which of the given options least resemble permanent teeth. We can analyze the provided documents to find the characteristic features of permanent teeth. From 'Mineral metabolism and microstructural defects in primate teeth', we know that prehistoric human populations had a great deal of diversity in the microstructural quality of their teeth, indicating differences in diet and health state. In contrast, modern humans have unworn teeth which prevent anatomic and physiologic changes. This suggests that permanent teeth may not resemble those with wear or attrition. We can also refer to 'Clinical, histologic and micro-radiographic study of natal, neonatal and pre-erupted teeth' which describes the characteristics of developing teeth, including hypoplasia, irregular dentin, and lack of cementum.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
