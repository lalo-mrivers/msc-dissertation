["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the biomechanical properties and collagen fiber orientation of TMJ discs. The surface of the disc has an undulated configuration that aids in storing synovial fluid and providing lubrication to the joint, which is important for controlling position and movement. The middle part of the disc has fine fibrils twisted together tightly, working to absorb shock. The mediolateral fibers are composed of loose and less wavy bundles, while anteroposterior fibers are crossed perpendicularly by them in anterior and posterior bands. This suggests a stabilizing function.\",\n\"answer_choice\": A"]
