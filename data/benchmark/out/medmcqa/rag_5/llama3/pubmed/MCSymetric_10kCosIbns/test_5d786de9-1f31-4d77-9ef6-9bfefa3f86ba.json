["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the position of a child during an asthmatic attack. We need to consider the anatomy and physiology of children's airways compared to adults. The provided documents suggest that there are significant differences in the ABC's of children due to their anatomy and physiology. In 'Emergency management of the injured child', it is mentioned that infants and children are not little adults, which implies that their specific needs should be considered. In 'The unconscious child', there is no direct mention of asthmatic attacks or positions during such an attack. However, we can draw a connection to the sleep position study in 'Sleeping positions of infants in the Cape Peninsula'. The study found that 62.4% of infants slept prone with their face to the side.
