["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents mention the properties of zinc oxide-eugenol cements. The examination of compressive strength shows that it is a function of the diameter-length ratio of the cylinder and increases with this ratio. This suggests that the strength of zinc oxide-eugenol cement is not due to a specific component, but rather the composition and structure of the cement itself. The question specifically asks which component gives the strength, so we can eliminate options A-D as they are not directly related to the strength.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
