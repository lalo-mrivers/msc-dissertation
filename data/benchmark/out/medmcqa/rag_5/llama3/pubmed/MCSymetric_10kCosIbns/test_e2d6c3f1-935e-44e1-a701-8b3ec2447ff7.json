["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, I will review the provided documents. Since the question is about changes during pregnancy, I will focus on the physiological changes that occur during this period. From my knowledge of normal physiology, pregnancy is associated with an increase in cardiac output and stroke volume due to the demands of fetal development. Additionally, intravascular volume increases as blood volume expands to meet these demands.\n\nReviewing the documents, I did not find any information that suggests a significant increase in peripheral resistance during pregnancy. Therefore, I will eliminate options D: Increased peripheral resistance.\n\nThe other options are related to normal physiological changes during pregnancy. The presence of an intrauterine fetus would require increased cardiac output and stroke volume, which are reflected in the increased intravascular volume.\n\nSince there is no indication of a significant increase in peripheral resistance, I conclude that option D: Increased peripheral resistance is the correct answer.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
