["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the documents provided, it's mentioned that inhibition of setting for addition silicones has been observed using latex gloves. This suggests that there might be an issue with the interaction between the silicone and the glove material. The document '[Silicone molding compounds and latex gloves. The effect of latex gloves on addition and condensation silicones]' specifically states that some addition silicones showed nearly complete inhibition when mixed with latex gloves. Therefore, it's likely that the answer lies in avoiding or minimizing this interaction. One way to do this is by not using powdered hands while mixing the silicone.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: Delay pouring of cast\""]
