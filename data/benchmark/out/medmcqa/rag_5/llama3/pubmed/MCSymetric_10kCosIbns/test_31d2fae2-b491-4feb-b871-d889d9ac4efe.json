["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the crossed extensor reflex. From the provided documents, we know that muscle spindles have two kinds of sensory fibers with stretch-sensitive endings on nuclear bag and chain muscle fibers within the spindle. The stretch reflex responses initiated by primary sensory fibers are well defined. However, there are other stretch reflexes of poorly defined origin and distribution. Clinical studies show that these stretch reflexes exhibit regional responses or synergies. Specifically, the document 'Reflex patters initiated by the secondary sensory fiber endings of muscle spindles: a proposal' describes the crossed extension-flexion reflex and long spinal reflex. This suggests that the crossed extensor reflex is likely initiated by the secondary sensory fibers of muscle spindles.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
