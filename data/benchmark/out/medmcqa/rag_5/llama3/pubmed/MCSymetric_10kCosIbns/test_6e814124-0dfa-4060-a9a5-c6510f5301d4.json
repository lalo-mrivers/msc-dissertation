["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about assessing the risk of Down's syndrome in a present pregnancy. Since the patient has already had a child with Down's syndrome, we can use the available data on maternal age-specific incidence rates to estimate the risk. The patient is 38 years old, which means she falls within the high-risk group for having another child with Down's syndrome. We can look at the provided data and see that the risk of having a child with Down's syndrome increases significantly after age 30, especially after age 35. Therefore, we would expect the risk to be higher in this patient.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
