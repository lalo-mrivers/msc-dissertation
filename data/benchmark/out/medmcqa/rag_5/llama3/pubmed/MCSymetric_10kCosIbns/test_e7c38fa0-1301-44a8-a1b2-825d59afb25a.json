["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about maximum torque during implant placement. The relevant document that discusses this topic is 'Bioprogressive brackets and pentamorphic arches'. In this document, high torque values with no tip in preadjusted incisor brackets are mentioned as a potential problem. This suggests that excessive torque can be detrimental to the implant. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that during implant placement, maximum torque should not be above a certain value.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
