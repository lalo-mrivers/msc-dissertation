["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks which complication of stroke need not to be treated. Upon reviewing the provided documents, I see that one of the complications mentioned is aspiration pneumonia. In the abstract, it's mentioned that prevention of aspiration pneumonia is important in the acute phase of stroke. However, none of the options A-D directly relate to aspiration pneumonia. Therefore, I will focus on the other symptoms listed. Dysphagia (C) and numbness (D) are both symptoms that may occur as a result of stroke, but they themselves do not need treatment. Fever (A) is also mentioned in the document, which suggests that fever may be a complication that needs to be treated. Spasticity (B) is also a symptom that may occur after stroke, but it's not explicitly stated whether it should or shouldn't be treated.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
