["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has a chromosomal translocation 21/21. Based on the provided documents, we can see that this type of translocation is associated with an increased risk of bearing a child with Down syndrome (Maternal transmission of translocation 2;21 associated with Down's syndrome and Familial transmission of a (21q22q) translocation). The risk for Down's syndrome from the combined data of male and female translocation carriers in this case is approximately 6 in 100, or 0.06. Since the patient is a female translocation carrier, we can apply this risk to her situation. Therefore, the risk of Down syndrome in the child is not 100%, but rather 0.06.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
