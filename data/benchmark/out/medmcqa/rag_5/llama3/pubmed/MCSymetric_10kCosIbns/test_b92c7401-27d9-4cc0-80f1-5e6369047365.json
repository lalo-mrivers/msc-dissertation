["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about storing medicine at a cool place. There are several documents related to temperature maintenance, but one that stands out is 'Room temperature stability of drug products labeled for refrigerated storage'. This document suggests that many drug products labeled for refrigerated storage are stable at room temperature for extended periods.

Instead, it should be kept at a cooler but still reasonably warm temperature.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B: 2-8 degC\""]
