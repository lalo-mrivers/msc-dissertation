["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Firstly, the goal is to calculate the absolute risk reduction (ARR) and relative risk (RR). To achieve this, we need to find the number of patients who developed hypertension complications in both groups. From the table, it's 180 out of 15225 in the control group and 1620 out of 15225 in the intervention group. Now, let's calculate the ARR by subtracting the number of patients with complications in the control group from those in the intervention group: 1620 - 180 = 1440. The ARR is therefore 9.4% (1440/15225). To calculate the RR, we need to divide the number of patients who developed complications in the intervention group by those in the control group: 1620 / 180 = 0.9. Therefore, the ARR is 9.4% and the RR is 0.9.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
