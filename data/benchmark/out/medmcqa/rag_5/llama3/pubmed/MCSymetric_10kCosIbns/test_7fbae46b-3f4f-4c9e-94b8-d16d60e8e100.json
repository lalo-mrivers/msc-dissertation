["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the sulcular epithelium's role as a semi-permeable membrane. The relevant documents describe the sulcular epithelium's potential for keratinization and its interaction with connective tissue. Enzymatic penetration through intact sulcular epithelium was explored in two studies, one showing hyaluronidase can penetrate the epithelium, while collagenase does not on its own but can spread easily when preceded by hyaluronidase. Scanning electron microscopy reveals complex systems of ridges and folds on epithelial cells' lateral surfaces. Microplicae are characteristic ridge-like folds of plasmalemma observed in stratified squamous epithelial cells lining the alimentary tract, cornea, and conjunctiva. The study on epithelium--connective tissue interface of oral mucous membranes highlights the differences in morphologic patterns between various anatomic sites.\", \"answer_choice\": C}"]
