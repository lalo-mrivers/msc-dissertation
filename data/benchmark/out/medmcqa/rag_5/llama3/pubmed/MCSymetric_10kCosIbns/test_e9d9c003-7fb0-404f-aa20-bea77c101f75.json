["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has repeated vomiting and developed metabolic alkalosis. The relevant documents highlight the importance of electrolyte imbalance in cases of vomiting. In [Elevation of the total blood CPK test in vomiting of various causes], it is mentioned that elevation of total CPK (creatine phosphokinase) may occur in subjects with vomiting, excluding other known causes. This suggests that metabolic alkalosis could be related to the increase in CPK levels.\n\nIn [Cyclic vomit in children: seen through the psychiatrist's eye], it is noted that some patients may not have surgery or psychiatric intervention. This implies that the cause of vomiting might not be solely due to a physiological response, but rather a psychological conflict.\n\nThe patient's symptoms are more related to metabolic alkalosis than any other known cause. In [The postoperative vomiting after pyloromyotomie (author's transl)], it is mentioned that if the suspected cause of postoperative vomiting is a loss of gastric tone, individual adjustments in feedings must be made. This does not seem to apply to our patient.\n\nIn [Protracted vomiting following abrupt cessation of psychotropics: a case report], and [Supersensitivity psychosis with concurrent episodic vomiting], there are no specific findings that relate to metabolic alkalosis or repeated vomiting.\n\nTherefore, the most likely cause of the patient's symptoms is related to electrolyte imbalance. The treatment given should focus on correcting this imbalance.\n\nThe answer choice B: I.V. normal saline and potassium seems the most logical as it addresses both the sodium and potassium imbalances that may occur due to repeated vomiting and metabolic alkalosis.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
