["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the composition and structure of high copper amalgam alloys. The Microprobe analysis of a high Cu amalgam alloy document states that the alloy consists of minute dispersion of Cu3Sn, gamma(Ag3Sn), and beta(Ag-Sn). Amalgam made from this alloy exhibited a matrix of gamma1(Ag-Hg) with small reaction phase areas of Cu6Sn5. No gamma2(Sn-Hg) was observed. The other documents describe the properties and behavior of different amalgam alloys, including high copper amalgams. None of these documents mention corrosion or any form of it occurring in high copper amalgam.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: Corrosion does not occur at all\"\n}"]
