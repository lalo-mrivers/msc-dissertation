["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 5-year-4-month-old child with small chin (low SNB angle), distal step 2nd molar relation, narrow width of maxilla, and normal SNA angle. The patient also has decreased SNB angle and low FMA angle. This suggests that the patient may have a long face syndrome or vertical maxillary excess. The relevant documents suggest that this condition is characterized by excessive vertical growth of the maxilla. In the case report 'Correction of a long face', excision of a 12 mm band of bone through the maxilla and telescoping it up into a new position was used to correct the condition. Therefore, the appropriate treatment protocol for this patient would involve correction of the vertical maxillary excess.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
