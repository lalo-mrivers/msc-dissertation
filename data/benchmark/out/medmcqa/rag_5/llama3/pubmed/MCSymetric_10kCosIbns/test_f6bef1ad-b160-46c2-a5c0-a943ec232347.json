["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided, we can start by considering the symptoms of the patient. The patient has recurrent bloody diarrhea, which suggests that there may be an underlying inflammatory or ulcerative condition affecting the colon. The presence of multiple geographic ulcers on colonoscopy also supports this idea. Given the age of the patient (middle-aged), it is unlikely that she has adenocarcinoma colon, as this typically occurs in older individuals. Pseudomembranous colitis is not typically associated with geographic ulcers on colonoscopy. Therefore, we can consider Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis as possible diagnoses.
