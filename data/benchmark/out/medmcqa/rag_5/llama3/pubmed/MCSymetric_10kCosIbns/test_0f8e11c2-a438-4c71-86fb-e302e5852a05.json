["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Achondroplasia is a recessive genetic disorder. Both parents having achondroplasia means they are carriers of the mutated gene. The question asks about the chances of having an unaffected baby when both parents have achondroplasia, which implies that both parents must be homozygous for the normal allele or heterozygous (one copy of the normal and one copy of the mutant allele). The only way to get an unaffected baby is if both parents are carriers (heterozygous), in which case each contributes a normal allele to the offspring, making it possible to have an unaffected child. According to Mendel's laws, when two heterozygous parents have children, there is a 25% chance of having an affected child and a 50% chance of having an unaffected child.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
