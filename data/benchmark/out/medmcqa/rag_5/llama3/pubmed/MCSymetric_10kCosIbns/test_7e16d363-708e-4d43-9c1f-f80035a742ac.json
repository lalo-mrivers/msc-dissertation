["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The provided documents describe the structure of lamina densa in different tissues, including oral lesions in lichen planus, pemphigus vulgaris, dental granulomas and cysts, and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. The study on epidermal lamina densa in normal human skin shows that it consists of microridges, microvalleys, densely packed cobblestone-like structures expressing type IV collagen, and microfilaments with beaded appearances after trypsinization. Anchoring fibrils and oxytalan fibers are also observed to be attached to the torn lamina densa. Based on these findings, it can be concluded that anchoring fibers of lamina densa contain Type 4 collagen.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
