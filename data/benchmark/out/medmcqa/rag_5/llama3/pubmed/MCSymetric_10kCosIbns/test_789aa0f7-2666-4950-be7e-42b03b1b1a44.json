["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about which of the given options has an intracellular receptor. The passage 'Current developments in G-protein-coupled receptors' mentions that the sevenfold membrane-spanning receptors have been established, and this type of receptor is related to G protein activation. Therefore, we can infer that the options associated with G protein-linked receptors would likely have intracellular receptors. Among the given options, epinephrine is a hormone that binds to beta-adrenergic receptors, which are sevenfold membrane-spanning receptors. This suggests that epinephrine has an intracellular receptor.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
