["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The problem asks about the potential generated due to movement of freely diffusible ions across a semi-permeable membrane. From the given documents, it is clear that the documents deal with ion transport and permeability in lipid bilayer membranes. In particular, the document 'Measurement of membrane potential and estimation of effective fixed-charge density in membranes' talks about measurement of electrical potentials Em arising across cross-linked phenolsulfonate membrane separating NaCl solutions of molality M1 and M2. This suggests that the relevant equation is the Nernst equation.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
