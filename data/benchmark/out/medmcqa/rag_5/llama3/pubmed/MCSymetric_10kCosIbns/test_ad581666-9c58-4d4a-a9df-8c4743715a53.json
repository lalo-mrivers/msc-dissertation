["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about an enzyme that catalyses the transfer of a molecule group from one molecule to another. From the provided documents, we can see that peptidyl transferase center of ribosomes and nucleotide kinases involve major rearrangements with main chain displacements of up to 32 A. In both cases, the structural changes during a catalytic cycle have been derived from a number of separate X-ray crystallographic analyses. This suggests that the enzyme is likely involved in a transfer reaction.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
