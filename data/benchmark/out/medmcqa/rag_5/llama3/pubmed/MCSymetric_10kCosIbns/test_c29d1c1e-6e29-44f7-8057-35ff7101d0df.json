["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks which is responsible for adhesion of platelet on exposed collagen fibril after an injury. The relevant documents provide information about the interaction between platelets and collagen under flow conditions. According to 'High-speed platelet adhesion under conditions of rapid flow', platelet adhesion to native type I collagen was extremely rapid, with exponential half-times as short as 240 ms, and was nearly complete by 2 s. This RGD-independent process was not associated with platelet aggregation or secretion. The monoclonal antibody 6F1 directed against the glycoprotein Ia/IIa complex inhibited adhesion, suggesting that this complex plays an important role in the initial phases of platelet-collagen interaction under flow conditions.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
