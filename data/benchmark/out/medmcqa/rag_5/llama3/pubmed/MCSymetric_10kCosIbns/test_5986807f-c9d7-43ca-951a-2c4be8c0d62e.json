["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking which of the given muscles has parallel oriented fibers. According to the provided documents, pinnate muscles contain many relatively short fibers positioned in parallel but at an angle to the whole muscle. This reduces the per fiber force contribution. However, the total physiological cross-section and total muscle force are thus increased relative to arrangements with fibers parallel to the whole muscle.\n\nThe Saorius muscle is mentioned as having a classical pinnate arrangement of fibers, which implies that its fibers are not parallel oriented.\n\nOn the other hand, Rectus abdominis, Sternohyoid, and Tibialis anterior muscles are not discussed in the provided documents. However, based on general anatomical knowledge, it can be inferred that these muscles are likely to have different fiber orientations.\n\nTherefore, Saorius is the muscle with parallel oriented fibers except for the other options.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
