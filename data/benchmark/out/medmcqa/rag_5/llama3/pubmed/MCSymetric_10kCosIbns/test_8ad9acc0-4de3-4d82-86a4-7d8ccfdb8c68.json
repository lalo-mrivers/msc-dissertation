["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the mechanisms of periapical bone resorption. In vitro studies show that root-resorbing tissue rich in odontoclasts has bone-resorbing ability, and that bone resorption occurs only when it is placed in close contact with calvarium. Electron microscopic observations reveal various types of osteoclasts involved in bone resorption. The cat model study demonstrates that simulated immune complexes can induce periapical bone loss accompanied by inflammation and the presence of osteoclasts. Therefore, periapical bone resorption occurs due to the activation of mechanisms such as the complement cascade, prostaglandin synthesis, and neutrophil degranulation.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: None\"\n}"]
