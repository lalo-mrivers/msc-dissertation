["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about a ratio of number of deaths under 1 year of age to total live births per 1000 live births per year. This definition suggests that we are looking for an indicator that represents the proportion of deaths among infants (under 1 year old) in relation to the total number of live births. The relevant document is 'Perinatal mortality 1989' which provides data on fetal and neonatal mortality. However, this document does not provide the exact ratio requested. We need to look for another source that provides the desired information.\n\nOne such source is 'Differential mortality by sex in fetal and neonatal deaths'. This report presents vital statistics data for the United States from 1922 to 1936 and from 1950 to 1972, which includes information on fetal and early neonatal mortality. Although this document does not provide the exact ratio requested, it does mention that for 1950 to 1972, the sex ratio of fetal deaths is conservatively estimated to be 120:100. This suggests that there may be a higher number of male fetal deaths compared to female fetal deaths.\n\nAnother relevant source is 'The changing pattern of fetal death, 1961-1988'. This study presents cause-specific fetal death rates in the nonreferred population of a tertiary care unit and finds that the fetal death rate has diminished over time. Although this document does not provide the exact ratio requested, it does mention that there has been a significant decline in unexplained antepartum fetal deaths.\n\nBased on these documents, we can infer that infant mortality rate (the number of deaths under 1 year of age per 1000 live births) is the correct answer.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
