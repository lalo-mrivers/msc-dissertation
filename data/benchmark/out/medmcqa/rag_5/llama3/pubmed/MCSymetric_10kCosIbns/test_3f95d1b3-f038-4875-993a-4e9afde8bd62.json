["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to the documents, selenocysteine is incorporated into proteins co-translationally by a specific tRNA and insertion occurs on a UGA codon in the mRNA. This is mentioned in both 'Selenoprotein synthesis: an expansion of the genetic code' and 'Bar to normal UGA translation by the selenocysteine tRNA'. Additionally, it is stated that the selC gene product, tRNA(Sec), inserts selenocysteine at UGA (opal) codons in a specialized mRNA context.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
