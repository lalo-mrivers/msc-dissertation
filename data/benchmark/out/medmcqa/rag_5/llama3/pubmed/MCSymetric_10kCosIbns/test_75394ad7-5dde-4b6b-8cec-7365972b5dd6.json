["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The provided documents describe pit and fissure sealants with added fluoride, a development of adhesive pit and fissure sealants using MMA resin initiated by tri-n-butyl borane derivative. The concept of adding fluoride to pit and fissure sealants is explored in the first document. The second and third documents discuss the retention and effectiveness of these types of sealants as well as their bond strength with enamel. The fourth document presents a new adhesive fissure sealant developed using MMA resin initiated by tri-n-butyl borane derivative.\n\nFluoride pit and fissure sealants are considered the III generation because they incorporate fluoride into the material to provide an additional anticariogenic mechanism.\", \n\"answer_choice\": C"]
