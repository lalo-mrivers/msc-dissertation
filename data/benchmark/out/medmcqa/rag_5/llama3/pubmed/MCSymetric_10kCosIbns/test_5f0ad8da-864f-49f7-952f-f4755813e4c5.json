["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the increase of calcium in blood. The provided documents describe the relationship between total and ionized calcium in sheep when calcium levels are altered, but it does not directly mention the hormones that can increase calcium in blood. However, the document 'Hypercalcemia and hypocalcemia' describes various diseases associated with alterations in serum calcium concentration, including hypercalcemic disorders. The document 'Adverse effects of calcium administration' reports two cases where rapid increases of serum ionized calcium levels were observed after calcium administration. This suggests that excessive calcium administration can cause increased blood calcium levels. Therefore, it is likely that parathormone, which stimulates the release of calcium from bones into the bloodstream, can increase calcium in blood.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
