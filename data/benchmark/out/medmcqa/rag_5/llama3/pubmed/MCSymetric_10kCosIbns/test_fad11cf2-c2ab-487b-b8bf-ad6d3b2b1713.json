["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about localizing a supernumerary or impacted tooth. The relevant documents mention objective radiological stereo-photogrammetry as a method for determining the location of dislocated impacted teeth preoperatively in a model. This suggests that stereophotogrammetry or panoramic radiographs might be effective in localizing these types of teeth. However, the documents also mention occlusal views and periapical views.
