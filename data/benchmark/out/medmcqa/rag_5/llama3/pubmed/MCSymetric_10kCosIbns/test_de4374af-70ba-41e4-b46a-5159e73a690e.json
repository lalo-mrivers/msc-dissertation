["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the percentage of occlusal forces transmitted to teeth by occlusal rests in full tooth-borne dentures. We need to analyze the provided documents and identify relevant information related to this topic. One document that stands out is 'Reactive force distributions for teeth when loaded singly and when used as fixed partial denture abutments.' This paper discusses how forces applied to teeth are balanced by stresses generated within the periodontal membrane and alveolar bone. It suggests that axial types of loads produce compressive stresses on the periodontium, while oblique or horizontal types of loads produce zones of compressive and tensile stresses. This information is relevant to understanding how occlusal rests transmit forces to teeth in full tooth-borne dentures. We can infer from this information that occlusal rests do not transmit 100% of occlusal forces to the teeth, as it would imply a constant axial load on the periodontium, which is unlikely.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: 100%\""]
