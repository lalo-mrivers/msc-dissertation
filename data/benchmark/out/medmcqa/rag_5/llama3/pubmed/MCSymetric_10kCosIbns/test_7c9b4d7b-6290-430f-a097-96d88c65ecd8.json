["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about a tracking technique used. Upon reading the provided documents, I found that there are three techniques mentioned: non-contact system for 2-dimensional trajectory recording, visual tracking machine, and digital range-gated echocardiographic tracking. None of these techniques seem to be related to administering long acting antipsychotic, lithium monitoring, carbamazepine monitoring, or nicotine patch. The most relevant technique is the one used in the digital range-gated echocardiographic tracking which provides real-time position and velocity measurements on selected heart structures.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B: Lithium monitoring (nope, not related) C: Carbamazepine monitoring (nope, not related) D: Nicotine patch (nope, not related) -> None of the above -> Not found in the provided documents\""]
