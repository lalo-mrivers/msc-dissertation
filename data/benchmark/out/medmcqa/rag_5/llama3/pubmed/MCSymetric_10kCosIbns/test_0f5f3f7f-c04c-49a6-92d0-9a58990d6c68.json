["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents discuss smoke inhalation injuries, pulmonary complications, airway obstruction, and inhalation toxicity studies. Death due to smoke inhalation is primarily caused by hypoxemia, which is a reduction in the amount of oxygen in the blood. This can occur due to various reasons such as anemic hypoxia (insufficient hemoglobin) or ischemic hypoxia (inadequate oxygen delivery to tissues). However, based on the provided documents, it seems that the primary cause of death due to smoke inhalation is due to the respiratory failure caused by pulmonary parenchymal injury.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: All of the above\"\n}"]
