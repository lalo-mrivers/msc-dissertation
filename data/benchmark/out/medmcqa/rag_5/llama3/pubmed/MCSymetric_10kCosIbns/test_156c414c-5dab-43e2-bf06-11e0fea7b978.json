["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents discuss bacterial endocarditis, with different studies highlighting the causative organisms. [Bacterial endocarditis] mentions gram-positive organisms like Streptococcus viridans and Staphylococcus species as well as gram-negative bacteria like Pseudomonas aeruginosa. [Acute bacterial endocarditis] emphasizes staphylococci and gram-negative germs. [Microbial spectrum] lists streptococci, Staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococci, and gram-negative rods as causative organisms. None of these documents specifically mention post-operative endocarditis, but the data suggests that staphylococci are common causes of bacterial endocarditis. The best option is therefore B: Staphylococcus epidermidis.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
