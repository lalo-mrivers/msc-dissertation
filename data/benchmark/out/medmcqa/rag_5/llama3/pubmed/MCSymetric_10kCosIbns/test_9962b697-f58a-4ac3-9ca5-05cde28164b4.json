["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The radiological changes of renal papillary necrosis are independent of its etiology. Since CECT shows bilateral papillary necrosis, it's likely related to the kidneys. The question is asking which test should NOT be done to investigate the cause. Papillitis is a condition that affects the bile ducts and has different symptoms. Papillary muscle necrosis is a condition that affects the heart and is not related to kidney issues. There are no mentions of papillary-cystic tumor or pancreatic issues in this context. The question asks for tests that investigate the cause of papillary necrosis, which is likely due to some sort of kidney issue. Based on this information, we can rule out A: Urine acidification test, as it's related to the kidneys and would be a relevant investigation. We can also rule out D: Bacterial culture of urine, as it's also relevant to investigating the cause of papillary necrosis.\n\nThe options remaining are B: Sickling test and C: Urine-PCR for TB. Both these tests are relevant to kidney issues, so we cannot rule them out based on that alone. However, considering the information provided, we can conclude that both these tests would be useful in investigating the cause of papillary necrosis.\n\nThis leaves us with no clear answer, as all options seem relevant. Therefore, we should consider additional context or more specific details to choose between the remaining options.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"None of the above\"\n}"]
