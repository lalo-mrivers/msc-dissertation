["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about which cells are decreased in chronic periodontitis. We need to look at the relevant documents for information on cell types and their changes in different forms of periodontitis. In vitro phagocytosis by crevicular phagocytes in various forms of periodontitis suggests that the majority of cells in crevicular washings are PMNs, some macrophages, and few lymphocytes. The assessment of the immune status of patients with acute and exacerbated chronic periodontitis shows reduced T-lymphocyte levels in the acute period of the condition. Episodic progression of periodontitis--histologic associations suggests that bleeding on probing, probing depth, and probing attachment loss are statistically significantly greater at sites where clinical measurements suggest a high progression rate (P-sites). At P-sites, there were numerous inflammatory cells, and the percentage of mast cells, monocytes/macrophages, and plasma cells was statistically significantly greater than at control sites.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
