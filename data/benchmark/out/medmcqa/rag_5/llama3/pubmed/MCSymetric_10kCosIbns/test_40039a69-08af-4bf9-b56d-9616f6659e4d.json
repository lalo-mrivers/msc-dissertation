["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents provided information about elastic impression materials. The Effect of Impression Technique and Multiple Pours on Accuracy of Stone Models mentioned that the material used was a hydrophilic addition curing silicone. In Wettability of Elastomeric Impression Materials and Voids in Gypsum Casts, it was stated that elastomers with low contact angles with water produced artificial stone casts with fewest voids. This suggests that the impression material has good wettability. Since the question asks about washing the elastic impression before pouring, it is likely related to the interaction between the impression material and the gypsum slurry. Based on this information, it can be concluded that washing the elastic impression with a slurry of water and stone is done to prevent voids in the artificial stone cast.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
