["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about Beta-1,3-D Glucan testing. The provided documents mention different glucans, but they don't specify the purpose of testing or the specific conditions tested. However, we can infer that Beta-1,3-D Glucan is used as an immune adjuvant to augment antigen-specific T-cell responses. Given this information, we can eliminate options A, C, and D as they are all types of fungal infections, which would require different testing methods. Therefore, the correct answer is B: Mucormycosis\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
