["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the optimal position and shape of sublingual bars. Document 1 mentions that improper preparation of sublingual bars favors the development of caries and periodontal disease. Document 2 shows that variations in mandibular rest positions occur with or without dentures, affecting the vertical relation of rest. This suggests that a properly designed rest on the lingual surface of a canine is important. Document 3 discusses removable partial denture rest seats and the importance of avoiding dentin exposure.
