["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for a post-transcriptional modification of RNA. We are given documents related to transcription studies, incorporation of purine nucleoside 5'-[gamma-S]triphosphates as affinity probes for initiation of RNA synthesis in vitro, cycles of progressive realignment of gRNA with mRNA in RNA editing, and molecular organization and genome expression in eukaryotes. From these documents, we can identify the post-transcriptional modifications: splicing, 5' capping, and 3' polyadenylation. Glycosylation is not mentioned in any of the provided documents. Therefore, it cannot be a post-transcriptional modification of RNA.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
