["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for the least effective measure for a 17-year-old asymptomatic boy with a sho PR interval and delta wave on ECG. The options are Holter monitoring, treadmill stress test, beta blocker, and reassurance.\n\nFirstly, the presence of a sho PR interval suggests that the boy may have an underlying arrhythmia issue, which is consistent with the findings in the 'Proceedings: Frequency and form of arrhythmia and changes in ECG in juvenile healthy volunteers' document. In this study, it was found that 31% of healthy volunteers had ventricular premature contractions (VPCs) recorded occasionally.\n\nSecondly, the presence of delta waves on ECG suggests that the boy may have some degree of cardiac abnormality, which is also consistent with the findings in the 'Long-term ECG monitoring (Holter) in a group of healthy 14-to-18-year-old adolescents' document. In this study, it was found that almost all students had one or several disorders of heart rhythm.\n\nConsidering these points, Holter monitoring would be the most effective measure for the boy, as it would allow for continuous ECG recording over a longer period to detect any arrhythmias. Treadmill stress test may not be necessary in this case, as there is no indication of cardiac insufficiency or ischemia. Beta blocker may also not be necessary, as there is no indication of hypertension or cardiac rhythm disorders that would require beta blockade. Reassurance may be appropriate for the boy, but it would not address the underlying cardiac abnormality.\n\nTherefore, the least effective measure for the boy would be reassurance.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
