["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The coagulation pathway involves a cascade of enzymatic reactions. From the provided documents, it can be inferred that the sequence starts with factor XII (XII). Factor XII is activated by contact with negatively charged surfaces such as collagen or phospholipids. This activation leads to the formation of kallikrein, which then activates factors XI and IX in a sequential manner. Finally, factor X is activated, which ultimately leads to the formation of thrombin and subsequent clotting.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C: XII, XI, IX, X\"\n}"]
