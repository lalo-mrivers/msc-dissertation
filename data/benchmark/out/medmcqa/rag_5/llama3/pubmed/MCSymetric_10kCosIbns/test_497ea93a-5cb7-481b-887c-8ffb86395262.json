["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents mention the size of synthetic hydroxylapatite crystals being important to bonding stability, but do not explicitly discuss resorption. The study on cementum and bone mentions differences in cellularity and width of fibre bundles between lamellar bone and cementum, but does not compare resorption rates. The paper on S. aureus growth and phagocytosis suggests that the cement mixture can cause decreased phagocytosis and hexose monophosphate shunt activity of macrophage, which may affect immune response, but does not directly address resorption. Lastly, the study on glass ionomer cements discusses erosion behavior, but does not touch upon resorption. Based on these findings, it is likely that cementum resorption occurs less readily compared to bone.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
