["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The study on the inactivation of viruses in drinking and surface water mentions that heating up to 80 degrees C did not completely inactivate Parvovirus within one hour. It also states that Reovirus could be inactivated after one hour only at 60 degrees C, suggesting that boiling water may not be a reliable method for viral decontamination. The other viruses used in the study lost their infectivity at 56 degrees C or 60 degrees C respectively. There is no mention of hepatitis B virus or mycobacterium tuberculosis in the provided documents. Therefore, we can conclude that boiling water does not necessarily kill these types of pathogens.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
