["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to the document 'Oral surgery in general dental practice. Assessment of lower third molars.', when planning to remove an impacted tooth, a dentist needs to assess retention or resistance form deficiencies, reveal need for augmentive periodontal crown-lengthening surgical procedures, and preplan occlusal plane deficiencies and methods of corrective treatment. This suggests that a periapical film (A) would be insufficient as it does not provide information on the relationship between the impacted tooth and surrounding structures. A lateral view (C) or anteroposterior view (D) might provide some additional information, but they are unlikely to show the necessary details. Therefore, a bite-wing film (B) is likely of little or no use in this context.\", \"answer_choice\": B}"]
