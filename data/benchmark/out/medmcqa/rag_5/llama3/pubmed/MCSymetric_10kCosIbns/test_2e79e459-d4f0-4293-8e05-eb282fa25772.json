["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the composition of a cell membrane. From the provided documents, we can see that colloid chemistry was introduced after the discovery of protoplasm which exhibits gelatin-like properties. The AI hypothesis suggests that the three major components of the living cell (water, proteins and K+) are closely associated; together they exist in a high-(negative)-energy-low entropy state called the living state. In the context of membrane studies, we can see that the 'fluid mosaic model' is presented as a particularly dynamic picture of the membrane machine and its components (pathways for active and passive transport, enzymes, hormonal receptors and other active sites). From these concepts, it becomes clear that cell membranes consist of both lipids and proteins.\",\n\"answer_choice\": A"]
