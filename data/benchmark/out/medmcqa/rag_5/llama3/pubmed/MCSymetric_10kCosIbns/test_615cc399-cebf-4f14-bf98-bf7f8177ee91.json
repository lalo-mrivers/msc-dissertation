["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the typical composition of a lipoprotein. We can look at the documents to find the information. The first document mentions that lipoproteins were separated by successive precipitation: VLDL with Heparin/Mg++, LDL with Dextran sulfate/Mg++ and finally HDL with Dextran sulfate/Mn++. Lipids extracted from the precipitated lipoproteins were determined gravimetrically and by densitometry after thin layer chromatography and charring. This suggests that the typical composition of a lipoprotein might include different types of lipids.\n\nThe second document mentions that triglyceride-poor very low density lipoproteins (VLDL) consist of 20.5% phospholipids, 30.8% free cholesterol, 15% cholesterol esters and 33.7% triglycerides. This suggests that the typical composition of a VLDL might include phospholipids, free cholesterol, cholesterol esters, and triglycerides.\n\nThe third document mentions that high density lipoproteins (HDL) were fractionated by ion exchange column chromatography using a continuous NaCl gradient. It was found that HDL is comprised of 3 subfractions, all containing apo A-I and apo A-II but with different ratios. This suggests that the typical composition of an HDL might include apoproteins.\n\nThe fourth document mentions that very low density lipoproteins (VLDL) have a spherical particle size ranging from 300-450 A in diameter as revealed by electron microscopy. This suggests that the typical composition of a VLDL might also include phospholipids, free cholesterol, cholesterol esters, and triglycerides.\n\nFrom these documents, we can conclude that the typical composition of a lipoprotein might include different types of lipids such as phospholipids, free cholesterol, cholesterol esters, and triglycerides. Additionally, apoproteins may also be present in some lipoproteins.\", \"answer_choice\": D}"]
