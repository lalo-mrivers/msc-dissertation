["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about a material that speeds up a chemical reaction without chemically becoming involved. This means the material is not participating in the reaction itself, but rather facilitating it in some way. Considering the provided documents, we can see that enzymes are discussed as catalysts that speed up reactions. The document on 'Principles for designing enzyme-like catalysts based on the rate-acceleration mechanisms of semisynthetic oxidases' specifically talks about designing catalysts that enhance reaction rates without participating in the reaction. This suggests that a catalyst is the correct answer.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C: A catalyst\"\n}"]
