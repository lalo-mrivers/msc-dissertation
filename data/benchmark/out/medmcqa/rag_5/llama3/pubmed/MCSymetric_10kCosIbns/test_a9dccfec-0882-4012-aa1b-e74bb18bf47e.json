["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Lanolin is a key component of ZOE paste. According to the first document 'Lanolin and derivatives chemistry: relationship to allergic contact dermatitis', lanolin has natural free fatty alcohols that can cause allergic reactions. The second document 'Lanolin with reduced sensitizing potential' suggests that removing these free fatty alcohols reduces the incidence of detectable hypersensitivity by 96%. Since irritation is caused by the free fatty alcohols, removing them would likely decrease irritation due to eugenol. Therefore, lanolin is added in ZOE paste to decrease irritation.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
