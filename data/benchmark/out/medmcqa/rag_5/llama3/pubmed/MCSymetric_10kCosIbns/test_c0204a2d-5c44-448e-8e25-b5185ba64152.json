["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the provided documents, it is clear that transudate is a type of fluid formed in response to an increase in hydrostatic pressure or changes in colloid osmotic pressure. This is evident from studies on pre- and post-sinusoidal origin of hepatic exudate in anesthetized cats, interstitial transudation with postural changes in man, permeability enhancement by exudates: 1. Demonstration of high-molecular substances in the animal model, Sterility of intestinal transudate during aortic reconstructive procedures, and Subepithelial hydrostatic pressure may regulate plasma exudation across the mucosa. These studies demonstrate that transudate is not associated with inflammatory conditions, has low protein content, does not tend to clot, and has specific gravity less than 1.018.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
