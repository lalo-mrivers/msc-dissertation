["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the effectiveness of glucagon injection for management of persistent hypoglycemia. The given documents provide information about glucagon's effects on blood glucose and insulin concentrations. According to [Comparison of blood glucose and insulin concentrations in man after intravenous injection of 1.0, 0.1 and 0.01 mg of glucagon (author's transl)], glucagon increases blood glucose concentration but does not have a significant effect on hyperglycemic response between doses of 1.0 mg and 0.01 mg. This suggests that glucagon can be effective for managing hypoglycemia. However, [Intramuscular or intravenous glucagon for sulphonylurea hypoglycaemia?] states that glucagon raises blood sugar concentrations when given intramuscularly or intravenously, but does not mention any specific condition where it is ineffective.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
