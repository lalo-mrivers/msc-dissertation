["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the minimum blood pressure. We need to look at the relevant documents to find an answer. One document talks about recent developments in blood pressure measurement emphasizing recordings taken outside the physician's office. Another document discusses auscultatory measurement of blood pressure and how the observer introduces a considerable subjective factor. A third document mentions self-recorded blood pressure values, but it does not provide specific information on minimum blood pressure. The last document is a population study that provides reference values for ambulatory blood pressure and blood pressure measured at home. It suggests that daytime ambulatory pressures are higher than nighttime pressures. Based on this information, we can infer that the minimum blood pressure occurs during the night.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
