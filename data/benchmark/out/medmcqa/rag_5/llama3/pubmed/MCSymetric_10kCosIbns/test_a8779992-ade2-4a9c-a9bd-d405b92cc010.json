["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the percentage of collagen fibers and fibroblasts present in gingival connective tissue. The relevant information can be found in the provided documents, specifically [Collagens synthesized in vitro by diploid fibroblasts obtained from chronically inflamed human connective tissue]. According to this document, all cell lines synthesized predominantly type I collagen, with minor production of type III collagen. Additionally, it is mentioned that fibroblasts derived from diseased gingiva synthesize a collagen of composition (alpha1)3, probably of type I.\n\nFrom [Extracellular matrix in gingival fibroblasts], we know that the extracellular matrix of human gingival fibroblasts is composed of type IV collagen, other than fibronectin and type I-III collagens. This suggests that the main component of collagen fibers in gingival connective tissue is type I collagen.\n\nFinally, [The collagen of the gingiva and of its blood vessels] provides information on the morphology of collagen fibers in the gingiva, with small balls (condensations of collagen) and fasciculi present. This does not provide direct percentage values but gives an idea of the morphology of collagen fibers.\n\nBased on this analysis, we can conclude that the main component of collagen fibers in gingival connective tissue is type I collagen.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: 65%& 10%\""]
