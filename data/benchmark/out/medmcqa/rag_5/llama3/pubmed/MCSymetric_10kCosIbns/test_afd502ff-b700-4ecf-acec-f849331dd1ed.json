["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about lateral semicircular canal during coical mastoidectomy. Since the provided documents do not have any information about coical mastoidectomy or magnetic resonance imaging of semicircular canals, we cannot find a direct answer. However, one of the documents mentions magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of semicircular canals in the context of small animals. We can infer that MRI is used to visualize semicircular canals and identify endolymphatic and perilymphatic spaces.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"None of the above\"\n}"]
