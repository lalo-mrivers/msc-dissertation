["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about a pregnant lady with persistent late, variable deceleration with cervical dilatation of 6 cm. The patient was shifted to OT for surgery. I need to think step-by-step and decide which of the options is not done in managing this patient. From the given documents, I can see that oxytocin infusion stimulated strong and frequent fetal movements which caused the fetal grip on umbilical cord to release and FHR decelerations to disappear. This suggests that oxytocin may be used to stimulate uterine contractions or manage fetal distress.\n\nFrom the document 'Clinical significance of fetal heart rate patterns during labor', I can see that late decelerations are associated with poor neonatal outcome, especially in small fetuses. Therefore, it is likely that the patient's management involves monitoring and managing fetal well-being.\n\nThe document 'An unusual cause and treatment of decelerations in fetal heart rate' suggests that oxytocin infusion may be used to stimulate uterine contractions or manage fetal distress.\n\nFrom the document '[Physiology of uterine contractions]', I can see that oxytocin infusion is used to induce tocolysis if more than two contractions per hour are recorded as mean value over a period of one week in conjunction with a tendency of the portio to open up, or if more than three contractions are recorded independent of this sign.\n\nConsidering all these points, I can see that oxytocin infusion may be used to manage fetal distress and uterine contractions. Therefore, subcutaneous terbutaline is not done in managing this patient.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
