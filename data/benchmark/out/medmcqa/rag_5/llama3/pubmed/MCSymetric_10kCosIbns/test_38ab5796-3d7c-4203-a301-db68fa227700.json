["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents discuss pharmacokinetic models and the calculation of loading doses to achieve a certain level of drug concentration. The paper 'Relationship between loading dose and infusion rate to achieve any fraction of the steady-state level in any compartment model' proposes the calculation of the loading dose as a function of the infusion rate K0 and model parameters. This suggests that the loading dose depends on the rate of administration, which is option C.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
