["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the type of mandibular fracture managed by adapting mini plates. The relevant documents describe various methods of osteosynthesis, including Mandibular osteosynthesis by miniature screwed plates via a buccal approach, which uses monocortical juxta-alveolar and sub-apical osteosynthesis without compression or inter-maxillary fixation. This technique is suitable for many types of mandibular fractures, except those involving the condylar neck or pre-existing infection. The documents also discuss plate osteosynthesis in the mandible, including its use in edentulous or partially edentulous mandibles and anterior and premolar regions. Based on these descriptions, it appears that mini plates are used for non-load bearing purposes.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
