["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the biomechanical studies on various methods of osteosynthesis on a photoelastic model of the mandible, we can infer that when loading the fracture mandible posterior to the site of fracture, compression is present. Specifically, maximum stress on the mandible, especially in the anterior region, should be avoided for at least 3 weeks. This suggests that compression may occur on the inferior surface or medial surface of the mandible.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
