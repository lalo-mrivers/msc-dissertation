["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents indicate that serum ferritin is an excellent determinant of iron stores. In 'Serum ferritin as an early determinant of decreased iron stores in pregnant women', it was found that serum ferritin is the most sensitive determinant of depleted iron stores, with serum iron being next in sensitivity. This suggests that serum ferritin is a good indicator of iron depletion. Additionally, in 'Iron balance in pregnancy in relation to anemia', it was found that towards the end of pregnancy, some decrease in ferritin (&gt; or = 15 micrograms/ml) is physiological. This further supports the idea that serum ferritin is a sensitive test for detecting iron depletion.\", \"answer_choice\": B}"]
