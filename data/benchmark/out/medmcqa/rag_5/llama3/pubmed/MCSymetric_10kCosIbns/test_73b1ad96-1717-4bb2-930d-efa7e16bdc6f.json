["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents provide information on various dental materials and techniques. From the Report of the Committee on Scientific Investigation of the American Academy of Restorative Dentistry, we know that dentin bonding agents are a topic of research. The [Polymerization shrinkage and fitness of denture] document discusses different methods of processing resin, including heat curing and self-curing. The [The surface structure of dentin after routine treatments] study examines the surface structure of dentin after various treatment methods.
