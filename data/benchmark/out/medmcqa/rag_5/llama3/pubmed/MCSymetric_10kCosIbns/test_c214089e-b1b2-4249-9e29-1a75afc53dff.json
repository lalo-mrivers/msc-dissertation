["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the origin of Incus and Malleus. The provided documents are a morphometric and comparative study of the malleus and an embryological study on the anterior ligament of the human malleus. From these studies, we can conclude that Meckel's cartilage plays a role in the development of the malleus. Specifically, it is mentioned that Meckel's cartilage pilots the fibres of the ligament itself, which implies that it also has a role in the formation of the ossicles. Therefore, based on this information, we can infer that the Incus and Malleus are derived from the dorsal end of Meckel's cartilage.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
