["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks to identify the factor that does NOT affect the rate of dentinal fluid permeability. Based on the provided documents, we can analyze the determinants of hydraulic conductance in dentin. The text states that the value increased as surface area increases and/or as dentin thickness decreases. Additionally, it mentions that acid etching removed surface debris occluding tubules, resulting in a 32-fold increase in hydraulic conductance. This suggests that factors such as surface area, dentin thickness, and removal of surface debris can influence permeability.\n\nThe text does not mention temperature variation, pressure gradient across dentinal tubule, or rate of removal of substances by blood vessels as affecting dentinal fluid permeability.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D: Rate of removal of substances by blood vessels.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
