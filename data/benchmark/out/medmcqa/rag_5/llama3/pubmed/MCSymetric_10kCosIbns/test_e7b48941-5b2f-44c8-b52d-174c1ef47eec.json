["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about non-working contact in different dental scenarios. Natural dentition implies that the teeth are present but may not be aligned perfectly, which doesn't necessarily require non-working contact.

Distal extension RPDs (removable partial dentures) are designed to replace missing teeth and don't always require non-working contact.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: None.\""]
