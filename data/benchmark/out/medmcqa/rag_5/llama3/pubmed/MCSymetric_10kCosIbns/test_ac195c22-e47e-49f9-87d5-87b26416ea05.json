["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The child has received one dose of DPT and OPV at 2 months of age. The schedule for active immunization of normal infants and children is reviewed. For DPT, a booster dose should be given after the initial dose, and then every 4-6 years thereafter. For OPV, multiple doses are required, typically at 6 weeks, 10-12 weeks, and 14-16 weeks of age. Since the child is 18 months old, it's likely that the initial OPV schedule has been completed. BCG vaccine is typically given at birth or within the first few days of life. Measles vaccine should be given at age four to six years. Based on this information, a booster dose of DPT and OPV is due, as well as measles vaccine.\", \"answer_choice\": C}"]
