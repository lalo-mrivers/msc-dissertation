["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Acetazolamide is a non-competitive inhibitor of carbonic anhydrase enzyme. As it inhibits the enzyme, it will decrease the activity of the enzyme, which ultimately leads to a decrease in aqueous production and hence a reduction in intraocular pressure. This information is supported by the provided documents where it is mentioned that acetazolamide lowers intraocular pressure by decreasing aqueous production.\", \"answer_choice\": A}"]
