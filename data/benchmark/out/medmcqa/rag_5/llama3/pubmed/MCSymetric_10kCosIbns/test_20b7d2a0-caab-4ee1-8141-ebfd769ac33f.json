["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents provide information on hinge-axis location and its importance in various dental procedures. The first document discusses the advantages of locating the hinge axis for edentulous patients, including the ability to alter vertical dimension of occlusion on the articulator and obtain valid centric and eccentric relation records. This suggests that transfer of hinge opening axis is important for edentulous patients. The second document describes a study on hinge-type artificial knee joints, which is unrelated to dental procedures and does not provide any information on transfer of hinge opening axis. The third document evaluates the influence of locating the horizontal transverse axis of rotation of the mandible and the thickness of wax check-bite upon occlusion analysis. This study also does not provide information on transfer of hinge opening axis. The fourth document discusses the effect of bite plane use on terminal hinge axis location, which is related to dental procedures but does not specifically mention transfer of hinge opening axis. Finally, the fifth document describes a device that reproduces normal kinematics of the joint and eliminates friction, preventing pain and muscle spasm. This study suggests that transfer of hinge opening axis may be important for patients undergoing restoration of movement in their joints. However, based on the information provided, it appears that transfer of hinge opening axis is compulsory in edentulous patients to obtain valid centric and eccentric relation records and alter vertical dimension of occlusion on the articulator.\", \"answer_choice\": B}"]
