["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to the provided documents, swine flu outbreaks are known to occur in three patterns: pandemics every 30 to 40 years, with high excess mortality; epidemics much more frequently, with lower excess mortality; and usually mild sporadic outbreaks. The possibility of a swine-flu pandemic this winter is mentioned as well. Since the question asks about swine flu nowadays, considering it in news, I will think step-by-step about the patterns mentioned in the documents. Pandemics are rare and have high excess mortality, which does not match what we see in the news today. Epidemics occur more frequently with lower excess mortality, but again this does not match the current situation. The third pattern, mild sporadic outbreaks, is also not consistent with what we see in the news today. Therefore, I think that a pandemic is the most likely pattern to match the scenario described.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
