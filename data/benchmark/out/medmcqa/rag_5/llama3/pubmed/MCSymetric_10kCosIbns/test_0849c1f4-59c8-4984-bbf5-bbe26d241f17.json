["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The article on Tooth movement discusses the biological foundation of force-induced tooth movement. It highlights that cells, as well as extracellular components of the PDL and alveolar bone, participate in the response to applied mechanical forces, which ultimately results in remodeling activities. When a tooth is tipped, it applies pressure and tension to the periodontal ligament (PDL), leading to compression or stretching of the fibers.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C: Half compressed half stretched\""]
