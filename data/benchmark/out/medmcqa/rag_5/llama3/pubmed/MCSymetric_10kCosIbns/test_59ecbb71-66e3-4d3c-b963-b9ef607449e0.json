["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the histopathologic features of lichen planus. The ultrastructural studies reveal epidermal changes such as multiplication or dislocation of the basal lamina, fragmentation of basal keratinocytes, and formation of Civatte bodies. Additionally, mitotic figures of keratinocytes and Langerhans cells are observed. These findings suggest that the primary event in lichen planus represents an injury involving epidermal basal cells. Furthermore, studies on oral lichen planus show clinical and histologic correlations, indicating that alertness is essential for diagnosis. There is no evidence of neural hyperplasia in L.p., and nerve changes are caused by the typical inflammatory reaction found in this dermatosis. Finally, an immunohistochemical study finds antibodies against human fibrin, immunoglobulins IgG, IgA, IgM, and C3 complement component.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
