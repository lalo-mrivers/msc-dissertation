["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Upon reviewing the provided documents, it is clear that an epithelial lining is typically found in various parts of the human body, including the gastrointestinal tract, appendix, limbus, and tooth germ. In particular, the document on early lymphoepithelial relationships in human appendix describes the presence of follicle-associated epithelium (FAE) in the surface epithelium of the appendix. Similarly, the scanning electron microscopic study of the human limbal biopsy specimens shows that the epithelial cell surfaces vary greatly in shape and size, with mosaics of irregular polygons formed by the cells. The document on mechanisms of association of indigenous microbes also mentions the presence of microbial types that associate with epithelial surfaces without altering them ultrastructurally.\n\nIn light of these findings, it appears that an epithelial lining is not typically found in fistulae or aneurismal bone cysts. Fistulae are abnormal connections between two bodily organs or structures, and do not have a defined epithelial lining. Aneurismal bone cysts are benign tumors that occur in the bones of the skull or spine, and do not have a typical epithelial lining.\n\nTherefore, based on the provided documents, an epithelial lining is typically found in all of the following except D: Keratocytes.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
