["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the treatment approach for a 10-year-old patient with BCLP (bilateral cleft lip & palate). The maxillary transverse width is normal, but there's congenital missing of lateral incisor and impacted canine.

This defect requires surgical correction as early as possible. In this case, it seems that the focus is on the dental arch width and length, so we can refer to 'Late results of the surgical treatment in unilateral complete cleft lip and palate' which suggests that the maxillary canine arch width was smaller by 4 mm than those of the control group, while the mandibular molar arch width was considerably greater.
