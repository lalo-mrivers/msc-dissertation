["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about Angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) with PPARgamma function as well. The provided documents are related to angiotensin receptors and their functions. There is no mention of ARBs or PPARgamma in the given documents, which makes it difficult to directly answer the question. However, we can analyze the information provided to find a connection between Angiotensin receptor blockers and PPARgamma function.\n\nThe documents describe various compounds related to DuP 753, which are known to bind to angiotensin receptors. These compounds may have potential as antihypertensive agents due to their ability to inhibit cGMP phosphodiesterase.\n\nAlthough there is no direct mention of ARBs or PPARgamma in the provided documents, we can infer that the question is looking for an ARB that has additional function related to PPARgamma. The documents do not provide specific information about which compounds have this dual function.\n\nBased on our analysis and inference, we will choose an answer that seems reasonable based on current knowledge of Angiotensin receptor blockers and PPARgamma. However, please note that the question may be too open-ended or ambiguous to have a definitive answer based solely on the provided documents.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C: Telmisaan\""]
