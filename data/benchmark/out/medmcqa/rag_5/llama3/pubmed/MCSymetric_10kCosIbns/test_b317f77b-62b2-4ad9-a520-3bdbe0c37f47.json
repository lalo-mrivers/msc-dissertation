["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks for aggravated sexual offences according to POCSO (Protection of Children from Sexual Offences). The provided documents seem unrelated to POCSO. However, we can infer that the options are related to sexual offenses. Gang Rape, Rape by threatening, and Rape during communal violence all appear to be forms of rape or severe sexual offenses. These options do not provide any specific information about aggravated sexual offenses according to POCSO.\n\nTherefore, we must rely on general knowledge about POCSO. According to the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012, an aggravated sexual offense is defined as a sexual offense that is committed by a person who is in a position of trust or authority with respect to the child, or if the sexual offense is committed by a person who is related to the child.\n\nBased on this definition, Rape by police officer and Rape during communal violence seem to be forms of aggravated sexual offenses. Gang Rape and Rape by threatening do not provide enough information to determine whether they are aggravated sexual offenses according to POCSO.\n\nTherefore, the answer choice that corresponds to the option 'all of the following are aggravated sexual offense except' is A: Gang Rape.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
