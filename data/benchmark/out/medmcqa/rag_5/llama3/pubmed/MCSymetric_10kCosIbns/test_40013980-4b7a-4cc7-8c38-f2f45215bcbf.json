["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) as a disease characterized by the accumulation of highly differentiated lymphocytic cells that lack immunoglobulin-secreting ability and are immunologically incompetent. The leukemic cells have structural and metabolic characteristics similar to those of B lymphocytes, but they also share antigenic determinants with T lymphocytes. The cells from CLL patients show a monoclonal origin and carry only one type of light chain.\n\nIn the Emergence of a B-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma in a patient with B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia document, it is described that a patient presented with CLL and later developed a lymphoblastic lymphoma. The cells from the CLL were typical mature B lymphocytes, while the cells from the lymphoblastic lymphoma were immature B cells.\n\nBased on these descriptions, we can conclude that the tumor cells in CLL/SLL arise from mature B cells.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
