["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the documents provided, it can be inferred that IDL (Intermediate Density Lipoprotein) is a precursor to LDL. The document 'The plasma and tissue turnover and distribution of two radio-iodine-labelled pig plasma low density lipoproteins' mentions that 125I-LDL1 turnover studies were performed, but it does not specifically discuss the fate of IDL in plasma. However, the document 'The degradation of very low density lipoprotein by the extrahepatic tissues of the rat' suggests that the liver takes up partial degradation products of VLDL, which is similar to IDL. Additionally, the document 'Composition of very low density lipoproteins and in vitro effect of lipoprotein lipase' mentions that VLDL is degraded to LDL by lipoprotein lipase, implying a conversion from IDL to LDL. Therefore, it can be concluded that the fate of IDL in plasma is likely to be converted to LDL particles.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
