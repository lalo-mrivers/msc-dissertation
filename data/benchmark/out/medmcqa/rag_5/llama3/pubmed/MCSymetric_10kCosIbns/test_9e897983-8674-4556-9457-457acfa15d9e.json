["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for the minimum haemoglobin level below which 5% of pregnant females will have their haemoglobin levels. We can use the mean and standard deviation provided to calculate this value using the z-score formula. The formula is (x - μ) / σ, where x is the desired percentage's proportion below the mean, μ is the mean, and σ is the standard deviation. In this case, we want to find x such that 5% of the population has their haemoglobin levels below it. We can set up an equation using the z-score formula: (x - 10.6) / 2 = Z, where Z is the z-score corresponding to a proportion of 0.05. Rearranging the equation, we get x = μ + Z*σ.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
