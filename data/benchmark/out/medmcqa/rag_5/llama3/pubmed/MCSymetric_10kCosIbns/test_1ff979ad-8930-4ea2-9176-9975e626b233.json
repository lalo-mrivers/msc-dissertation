["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking which vitamin is synthesized in vivo by humans. The relevant documents mention the production of vitamins through biotechnological processes such as fermentation or bioconversion. It is also mentioned that some vitamins are produced chemically, while others are extracted from plant and animal food sources. However, the document 'Function of the fat-soluble vitamins' mentions that the only resemblance among the fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, and K) is their lipid solubility. This suggests that these vitamins may be synthesized in vivo by humans. Among the options provided, Vitamin A is mentioned as being produced chemically or biotechnologically via fermentation or bioconversion processes, but it is also one of the fat-soluble vitamins which are synthesized in vivo by humans.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
