["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents suggest that cobalt-chromium alloys are resistant to crevice corrosion. In the document 'Corrosion behavior of cast and forged cobalt-based alloys for double-alloy joint endoprostheses', it is mentioned that the mechanical properties of wrought CoNiCrMoTi alloy qualify it as a substitute for cast CoCrMo alloy. This implies that CoCrMo alloy has high resistance to corrosion. In 'Crevice corrosion in orthopedic implant metals' it is stated that cobalt-chromium alloys such as Haynes-Stellite 25 are the best choice for multicomponent implants and may result from use of mixed metals, suggesting that these alloys resist crevice attack. Finally, in 'The concept of protection potential applied to the corrosion of metallic orthopedic implants', it is mentioned that cobalt-base casting alloy (similar to Vitallium Surgical Alloy) exhibits a high (noble) protection potential which suggests resistance to crevice corrosion.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
