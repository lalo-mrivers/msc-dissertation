["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the mediator of Bezold-Jarisch reflex. In the provided documents, we can see that serotonin (5-HT) and phenyl biguanide (PBG) were used to elicit the Bezold-Jarisch reflex in anesthetized rabbits. Additionally, kynurenic acid (KYN), a glutamate antagonist, was injected into the solitary tract nucleus or caudal ventrolateral medulla to block the reflex. Bicuculline methiodide (BIC) was also used to block or attenuate the Bezold-Jarisch reflex. Therefore, serotonin is the mediator of the Bezold-Jarisch reflex.\", \"answer_choice\": A}"]
