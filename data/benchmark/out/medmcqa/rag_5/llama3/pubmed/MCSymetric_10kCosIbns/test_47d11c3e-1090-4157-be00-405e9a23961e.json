It also states that amongst the investigated hosts Hymenolepis diminuta, Cyticercus fasciolaris (larva of Hydatigera taeniaeformis), Strongyloides ratti and Hepaticola hepatica were the most widespread species of helminths. Ancylostoma is not mentioned in this passage. However, it is mentioned that during larval migration, eosinophile infiltration of the lungs and splenomegalia were generally observed as accompanying phenomena of endoparasitic infestations.
