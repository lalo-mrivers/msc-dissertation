["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about black deposits on the conjunctiva in a patient with glaucoma. There are no relevant documents mentioning black deposits or conjunctival changes caused by any of the options (A-D). However, we can rule out some possibilities based on the information provided. For example, the [Effect of anti-glaucoma eyedrops on cell differentiation of the conjunctiva] document mentions pilocarpine, timolol, and levobunolol, but does not mention black deposits. This suggests that the answer is unlikely to be related to these medications. The other documents do not provide any information relevant to the question. Therefore, we can focus on the [Histologic differences in the conjunctiva of black and white glaucoma patients] document, which mentions mast cells and neutrophils. However, there is no mention of black deposits or any specific medication causing this.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
