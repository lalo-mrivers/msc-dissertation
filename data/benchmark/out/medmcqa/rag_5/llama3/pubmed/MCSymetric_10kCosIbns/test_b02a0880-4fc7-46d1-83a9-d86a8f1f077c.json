["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the source of estrogen and progesterone during the first 2 months of pregnancy. We can look at the provided documents for information on hormone levels during early pregnancy. The document 'Development of estradiol, progesterone, and prostaglandins E and F2 alpha levels during pregnancy in mice' shows that estradiol has a preimplantation peak on day 4, followed by peaks at the end of implantation (day 6) and on day 10. Progesterone increases when implantation begins (day 5). Another document 'Hormonal patterns in conceptual cycles and early pregnancy' shows increased levels of estrogen and progesterone between 12 to 48 days after ovulation, except for progesterone which decreases during this time. The document 'Longitudinal assessment of changes in reproductive hormones during normal pregnancy' provides information on the longitudinal changes in circulating maternal hormones during pregnancy. We can see that there is a significant increase in estrogen and progesterone levels during early pregnancy. Another document 'Secretion patterns of plasma-progesterone, 17-hydroxyprogesterone and 20 alpha hydroxypregn-4-en-3-one in early normal pregnancy' shows the pattern of plasma progesterone levels from week 4 to 16 gestation.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
