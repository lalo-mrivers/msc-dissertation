["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the role of Golgi tendon organ during voluntary movements. According to the documents, Golgi tendon organs are sensitive to subtle alterations in motor unit twitch waveform and amplitude (Document 1). They also respond to forces produced by single motor units, which couples to the receptor capsule and ensures that every twitch of every motor unit will be reflected in the population of afferent signals projecting to the spinal cord (Document 1). This suggests that Golgi tendon organs are sensitive to tension changes in the muscle. The documents also show that the responses of Golgi tendon organs to stimulation of different combinations of motor units were found to be proportional to applied static tension over a wide range (Document 3). Therefore, during voluntary movements, Golgi tendon organ continuously relays information about the tension in the muscle.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
