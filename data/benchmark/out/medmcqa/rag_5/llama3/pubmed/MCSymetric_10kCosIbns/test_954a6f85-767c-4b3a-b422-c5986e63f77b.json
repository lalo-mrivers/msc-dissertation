["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the cases where excessive occlusal forces can be superimposed. The relevant documents discuss occlusal instability, median occlusal position, and muscle deconditioning. From the information provided, it seems that vertical changes in an occlusion can be more damaging and require a more extensive treatment procedure. This implies that reduced height of bone is involved, which is mentioned in options B, C, and D. Therefore, we need to find out which of these options would lead to excessive occlusal forces being superimposed. According to the documents, this would occur if there was disharmony of the median occlusal position (MOP) and pain-dysfunction of the masticatory system. This is mentioned in the 'The clinical significance of median occlusal position' document. Since MOP is not directly related to periodontium or bone height, we can rule out options A, B, and D. The only option left is C: Marginal periodontitis with reduced height of bone.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
