["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, we can see that MRSA is resistant to most antibiotics except for vancomycin and arbekacin. In the document [Nosocomial infections due to methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) at the Kagoshima University Hospital (2). Susceptibility to antibiotics], it is mentioned that most strains of MRSA were resistant to PCG, MPIPC, ABPC, CET, CMZ, CZON, GM, and AMK. In the document [Incidence and antimicrobial susceptibility of clinical isolates of MRSA from 1988 to 1990, from the results of 26 clinical laboratories in Tokyo and the surrounding area], it is stated that MRSA showed poor sensitivity to beta-lactam antibiotics, gentamicin, tobramycin and clindamycin. Therefore, we can infer that MRSA is resistant to most antibiotics except for vancomycin and arbekacin.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
