["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the most probable cause of proteinuria based on immunofluorescence staining pattern from a kidney biopsy. Since the patient is 35 years old, and there are no specific age-related conditions mentioned in the documents provided, we can focus on the general information about glomerulonephritis. According to the document '[Value and limits of urinary protein electrophoresis with sodium dodecyl sulfate...]', proteinuria of the selective glomerular or physiological type predominates in minimal change or membranous lesions, while the non-selective type is found more frequently with diffuse proliferative or membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis. Since no specific histological findings are mentioned, we can't make a precise diagnosis. However, the presence of proteinuria suggests an underlying glomerular nephropathy.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
