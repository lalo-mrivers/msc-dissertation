["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about a child with Down's syndrome having Moon facies, which are characterized by narrow palpebral fissures with a mongoloid slant. The relevant document that discusses the ocular features of Down's syndrome is 'Pathologic features of the eye in Down's syndrome with relationship to other chromosomal anomalies.' This document mentions that many lesions reflected excessive genetic material and qualitatively resembled those lesions in trisomy 13 and 18 syndromes. Another relevant document is 'Down's syndrome: a ten-year group study,' which discusses the ophthalmologic examination findings of 30 individuals with Down's syndrome over a period of 10 years. The most frequent ocular anomalies mentioned are oblique fissures, refractive error, blepharoconjunctivitis, epicanthus, and Brushfield's spots.\n\nFrom these documents, we can infer that the facial characteristics associated with Down's syndrome include epicanthus and Brushfield's spots. Epicanthus is described in 'Down's syndrome: a ten-year group study' as one of the most frequent ocular anomalies. Brushfield's spots are mentioned in both 'Pathologic features of the eye in Down's syndrome with relationship to other chromosomal anomalies' and 'Down's syndrome: a ten-year group study' as a characteristic feature of Down's syndrome.\n\nThe question asks about which facial characteristic is present in a child with Down's syndrome having Moon facies, retarded mentally. The relevant facial characteristics mentioned are maxillary prognathism, mandibular retrognathia, mandibular prognathism, and maxillary hypoplasia.\n\nBased on the documents provided, epicanthus is one of the most frequent ocular anomalies associated with Down's syndrome. Therefore, we can infer that epicanthus is a facial characteristic present in a child with Down's syndrome having Moon facies, retarded mentally.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
