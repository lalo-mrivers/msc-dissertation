["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the given documents, we can see that reticulocytosis is mentioned as a method for determining reticulocyte counts in animals with reticulocytosis [A method for the quantitative determination of reticulocytes in induced reticulocytosis]. Additionally, it is mentioned that an application for the technique developed has been submitted and positive approval has been obtained on November 20, 1987. This suggests that reticulocytosis is a measurable phenomenon. In [Chacterization of human reticulocytes: respiration, Pasteur effect, and electron microscopic findings on mitochondria], it is mentioned that immature reticulocytes are discharged in man (similar to the socalled \"stress reticulocytes\" of rabbits). This implies that there may be situations where reticulocytosis occurs. Furthermore, [Reticulocyte motility and form: studies on maturation and classification] discusses the properties of reticulocytes, including their motility and form. This suggests that reticulocytosis is a process that involves changes in the properties of reticulocytes.\n\nFrom these points, it can be inferred that reticulocytosis is likely to occur in situations where there is an increase in the production or release of immature red blood cells, such as in hemolytic anemia. This is supported by the mention of 'stress reticulocytes' in [Chacterization of human reticulocytes: respiration, Pasteur effect, and electron microscopic findings on mitochondria].\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
