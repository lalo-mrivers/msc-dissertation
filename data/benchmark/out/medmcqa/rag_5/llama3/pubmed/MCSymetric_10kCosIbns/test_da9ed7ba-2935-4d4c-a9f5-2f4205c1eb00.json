["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The conversion of glucose-6-P to fructose-6-P is a reaction that involves the interconversion of hexose phosphates. According to the document 'Phosphoglucoisomerase-catalyzed interconversion of hexose phosphates: distinction of the 1-monodeutero-isotopomers of D-fructose 6-phosphate by 1H NMR spectroscopy', this reaction is catalyzed by phosphoglucoisomerase. This suggests that the conversion is an example of isomerization.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B\n}"]
