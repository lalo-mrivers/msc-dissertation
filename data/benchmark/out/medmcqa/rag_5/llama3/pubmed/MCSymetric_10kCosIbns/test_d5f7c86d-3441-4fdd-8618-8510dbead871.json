["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents discuss the evolution of regulatory proteins, nuclear receptor gene superfamily, and the organization of the human genome. The question is asking about the maximum number of genes that code for receptors in the mammalian genome. Since none of the given options explicitly mention receptors, we need to look for information about receptors in the provided documents. The document 'Evolution of regulatory proteins' mentions signal receptor proteins, which suggests that some genes code for receptors. In the document 'Evolution of the nuclear receptor gene superfamily', it is mentioned that nuclear receptor genes represent a large family of genes encoding receptors for various hydrophobic ligands. This information supports the idea that many genes in the mammalian genome code for receptors.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"]
