["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, it can be inferred that local irritating factors in gingiva are likely to give rise to inflammation. The study on experimental gingivitis [Local and systemic immune response during experimental gingivitis] mentions that adult rats reacted stronger to plaque antigens than young rats and that previous contact with the antigens increased the reaction. This suggests that local irritation can stimulate an immune response in the gingiva. Additionally, the paper on histopathologic features of the initial and early stages of experimental gingivitis in man [Histopathologic features of the initial and early stages of experimental gingivitis in man] describes the development of inflammation in the gingival tissues within 8 days following the beginning of plaque accumulation. Therefore, local irritating factors are most likely to give rise to gingival inflammation.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
