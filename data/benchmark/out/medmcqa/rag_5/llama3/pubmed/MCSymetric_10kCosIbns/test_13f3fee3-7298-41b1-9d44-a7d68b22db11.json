["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents discuss complications and surgical techniques related to submandibular calculi. The document '[Complications of surgical treatment for submandibular calculi (author's transl)]' mentions that lost calculi can occur during operations on Wharton's duct, which suggests that the calculus may not be removed through traditional means. In [Morbidity associated with removal of the submandibular gland], it is mentioned that sialolithiasis is a common complication and that residual inflammation in Wharton's duct can occur after surgery. This implies that the calculus itself needs to be addressed during surgical procedures. The document '[Examination technique in ultrasound calculus detection in the submandibular gland]' discusses techniques for detecting submandibular calculi, including ultrasound scanning which can reveal a third shadow between the mandible and hyoid bone indicating the presence of a calculus. This suggests that the calculus is visible using this imaging modality. Finally, [The debridement of submandibular abscesses under locoregional block] does not provide specific information about removing calculi but rather discusses techniques for managing submandibular abscesses. Based on these findings, it appears that removing a submandibular calculus requires some form of surgical intervention.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
