["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents discuss the development of the larynx, particularly the cartilages. The morphogenesis study (A few remarks on the morphogenesis of the larynx) mentions that the primitive ventricles begin to form from the lateral margin of the LC, which constitutes the primordium of the laryngeal vestibule. This suggests that the cartilage may develop from a common source with the laryngeal cavity. The paper (Phylogenesis of the human larynx) discusses the evolution of the larynx and its function in preventing substances other than air from entering the pulmonary air tract, indicating that the development of the cartilage is related to this function. Furthermore, the papers on vascularization and computed tomography provide insight into the structure and organization of the laryngeal cartilages.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
