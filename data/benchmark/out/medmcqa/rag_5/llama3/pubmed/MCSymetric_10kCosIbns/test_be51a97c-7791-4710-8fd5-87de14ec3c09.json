["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the appearance of dead bone on a radiograph. We can consider the given documents to answer this. From 'Pathological bone structure (author's transl)', we know that various diseases of the skeleton cause changes in radiographic images, including abnormalities of bone formation and removal. Dead bone is an example of removed bone. From 'Radiological bone patterns compared with pathological and anatomical appearances (author's transl)', we can see that comparing radiographs with actual specimen sections helps to understand structural changes. This document does not specifically mention dead bone but provides a framework for analyzing radiographic images.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
