["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the relationship between IgE and IgG antibodies in type I allergy. It is mentioned that a statistically significant correlation exists between the titers of anti-allergen antibodies of both isotypes. Additionally, it is discussed that immune stimulation in atopic individuals affects not only the IgE-producing antibody systems but also the IgG-producing antibody systems. Furthermore, the importance of identifying specific antibodies of the immunoglobulin-E type for diagnosing allergy is emphasized. Based on this information, it can be inferred that IgE and IgG are involved in chronic allergy.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
