["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the function of Golgi tendon organs. From the provided documents, we can infer that Golgi tendon organs are responsible for detecting the tension within tendons, as described in the ultrastructural features of adult human tendons. The document states that 'a variety of human tendons have been studied at the electron microscope level' and mentions that the fibers of these tendons are composed of collagen fibrils that average 1,750 A and 600 A in diameter. This suggests that Golgi tendon organs play a role in detecting the tension within these tendons.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: All\""]
