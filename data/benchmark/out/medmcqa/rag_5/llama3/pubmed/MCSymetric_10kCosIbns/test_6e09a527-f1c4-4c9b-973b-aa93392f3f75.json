["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about one of the many mechanisms of adverse events, which is increased binding to secondary targets, usually proteins. The primary target refers to the initial target molecule that the substance interacts with. Since the substance binds to the secondary target more tightly than the primary target, it's likely that the secondary target has similar properties or characteristics that allow this binding to occur. This could be related to binding sites, structure, or other features.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
