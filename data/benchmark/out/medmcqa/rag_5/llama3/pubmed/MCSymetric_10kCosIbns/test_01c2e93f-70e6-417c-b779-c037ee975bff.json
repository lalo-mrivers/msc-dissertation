["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the inhibition of release of synaptic vesicle from presynaptic terminal. The relevant documents describe the process of transmitter release from synaptic vesicles and its regulation. In the document 'Synaptic depression related to presynaptic axon conduction block', it is mentioned that repetitive stimulation eventually leads to depolarization of the axon membrane, causing impulse propagation failure which reduces the number of synaptic release sites that are activated. This could be interpreted as an inhibition of release of synaptic vesicle from presynaptic terminal.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
