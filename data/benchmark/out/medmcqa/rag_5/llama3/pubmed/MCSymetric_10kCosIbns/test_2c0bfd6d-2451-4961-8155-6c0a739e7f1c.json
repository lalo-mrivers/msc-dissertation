["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about statements about tRNA molecules. From the provided documents, it can be seen that the structures of tRNAs are indicated by specific underlining for secondary structure. The primary structure mentions nucleosides followed by brackets or modifications in brackets, denoting ambiguity. Rare nucleosides are named according to IUPAC-IUB rules. Footnotes refer to citations and coordinates of corresponding nucleosides. Mutant tRNAs are dealt with separately. The documents also describe the dynamic model of tRNA, including its interaction with mRNA and ribosomal RNA's. A novel cloverleaf structure is found in mammalian mitochondrial tRNA(Ser) (UCN). An algorithm is developed to identify potential tRNA genes in genomic DNA sequences. Considering these points, we can evaluate each choice.\", \"answer_choice\": B}"]
