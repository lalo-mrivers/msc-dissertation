["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The provided documents do not directly address the use of functional appliances in skeletal Class II. However, one document ('The effect of functional appliances on the skeletal pattern') mentions that there is no appreciable holding back of maxillary advancement and a slight mean increase in mandibular growth, mainly in a vertical direction. This suggests that functional appliances may be used to address issues related to the mandible or jaw alignment. Since the documents do not specifically discuss Class II cases, we must consider other factors. In skeletal Class II, the mandible is typically retrognathic. Option A ('Maxilla is normal, mandible is retrognathic') seems a reasonable choice given the information provided.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
