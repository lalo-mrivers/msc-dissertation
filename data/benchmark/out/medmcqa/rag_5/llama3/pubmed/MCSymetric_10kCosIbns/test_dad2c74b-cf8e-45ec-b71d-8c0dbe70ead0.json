["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the characteristics of agar plates incubated at elevated temperatures. The first document mentions that the numbers of colony forming units (cfu) can vary depending on incubation conditions and location of an individual agar plate in a stack, with slower heating-up rates if the incubators do not have an air circulator and/or if the plates are located in the centre of a stack. This suggests that agar temperatures may be affected by external factors. The second document describes the degradation of agar by a gram-negative bacterium, which grows well in simple salts medium containing various carbohydrates. Growing bacteria dissolved gels and suspensions of agar and agarose rapidly. However, there is no direct mention of gelation temperature. The third and fourth documents discuss artifacts from agar-protein interaction and the effect of different grades of agar on the nature of test microbe growth inhibition zones, respectively. There is no specific information about the gelation temperature of agar in these documents. Therefore, we can infer that the gelation temperature may not be explicitly mentioned.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
