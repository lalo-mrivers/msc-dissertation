["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the condition where mandibular stabilization is not governed by facial nerve contraction. From the given documents, we can see that the marginal mandibular branch of the facial nerve controls mandibular protrusion. However, the document 'Telemetry and the study of vertical jaw relations' states that the rest position of the mandible is determined by passive soft tissue balance, but subject to overriding muscular control. This suggests that there may be a condition where mandibular stabilization is not governed by facial nerve contraction. Upon reviewing the documents, we find that the document 'A mechanism for passive mandibular depression' describes excessive craniofacial flexion or retention of a juvenile configuration of the mandible as causing crepitation and clicking. This suggests that there may be a condition where the elasticity of the ligaments produces an integrity maintenance force between the articular condyle and eminence, which is normally of minimal size. This could result in increased pathological manifestations, such as crepitation and clicking, rather than mandibular stabilization being governed by facial nerve contraction.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
