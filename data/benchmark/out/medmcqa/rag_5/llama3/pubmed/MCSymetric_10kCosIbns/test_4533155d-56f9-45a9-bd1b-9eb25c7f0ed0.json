["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the demarcation of the anterior two-thirds of the tongue from the posterior one-third. Looking at the provided documents, we can see that the morphology of the vertical and transverse intrinsic musculature of the tongue in the 15-week human fetus is described. There is no mention of a plexus or thoracic plexus. The document about the anatomy of the tongue does not provide information on the demarcation between the anterior and posterior parts of the tongue.

Therefore, we can infer that Passavant's ridge may be responsible for the demarcation.\",\n\"answer_choice\": A"]
