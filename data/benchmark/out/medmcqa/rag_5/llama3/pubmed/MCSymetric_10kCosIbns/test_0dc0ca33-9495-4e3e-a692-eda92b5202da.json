["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents provided describe various aspects of tooth eruption, molar formation, and dental development. In the context of 2nd and 3rd molar eruption, we can draw parallels with the description of continuous tooth eruption in Australian aboriginal skulls. The study found that CEJ-AC distances increased as the severity of attrition increased, indicating that the teeth continued to erupt without a corresponding coronal movement of alveolar bone. This suggests that the arch space for eruption of 2nd and 3rd molars was created through a process other than apposition or resorption.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
