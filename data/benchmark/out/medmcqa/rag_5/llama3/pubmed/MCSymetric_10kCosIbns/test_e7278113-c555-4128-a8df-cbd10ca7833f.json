["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The problem asks to calculate the amount of drug remaining after 6 hours. First, we need to find the initial rate constant (k). Since the drug is eliminated according to first-order kinetics, the elimination rate can be described by the equation: dC/dt = -k*C. Where C is the concentration of the drug and t is time.\n\nFrom the given information, we know that 75 mg of the drug was eliminated in 90 minutes. To find k, we can use the formula: k = ln(2)/T1/2, where T1/2 is the half-life of the drug.\n\nSince only 25% of the initial dose (200 mg) has been eliminated, that means 50% of the initial dose would be eliminated in 90 minutes. This corresponds to a half-life of 45 minutes.\n\nPlugging this value into the formula for k, we get: k = ln(2)/0.75 = 0.0929/hour.\n\nNow, we can use the equation dC/dt = -k*C to find the concentration of the drug at any given time. Since we want to know how much drug will remain after 6 hours, we need to integrate this equation from t=90 minutes to t=6 hours (i.e., 360 minutes).\n\nUsing numerical integration or approximation methods, we can calculate that approximately 30 mg of the drug remains after 6 hours.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is: C.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"]
