["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks for a statement that is false. From the provided documents, I can see that nasal fractures are often associated with bilateral ecchymosis and facial oedema (Legal aspects in nasal fractures), they may require reduction over time (Nasal trauma), and they can lead to complications such as telecanthus (Open reduction of nasal fractures). Therefore, the statement that suggests nasal fractures do not need to be complicated by traumatic telecanthus is false.

Based on this analysis, the correct answer is C.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"]
