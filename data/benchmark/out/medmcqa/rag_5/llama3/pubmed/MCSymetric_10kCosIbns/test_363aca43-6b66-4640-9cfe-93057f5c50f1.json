["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the effects of nitrates on patients with angina pectoris and acute myocardial infarction. In unstable angina pectoris, the major factors in pathogenesis appear to be intracoronary platelet aggregation and thrombus formation secondary to fissuring or rupture of atheromatous plaques, with associated coronary vasoconstriction due to release of constrictor materials from aggregating platelets and deficiency of endothelium-related vasodilator activity. The efficacy of nitroglycerin in limiting platelet aggregation is also of particular interest in this condition. Nitrates are used extensively for the treatment of angina pectoris, and their beneficial effects have positively influenced the prognosis of treated patients. In acute myocardial infarction, intravenous nitroglycerin lowers left ventricular filling pressure and systemic vascular resistance.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
