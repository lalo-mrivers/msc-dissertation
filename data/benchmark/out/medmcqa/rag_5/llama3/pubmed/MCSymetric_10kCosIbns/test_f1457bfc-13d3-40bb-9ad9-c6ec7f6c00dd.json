["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant document is 'The pathway of parasympathetic nerve fibers to cerebral vessels from the otic ganglion in the rat'. According to this document, fibers leave the otic ganglion in the lesser superficial petrosal nerve and run on the anterior and medial inner surface of the tympanic bulla to reach the greater superficial petrosal nerve, then deviate via the deep petrosal nerve to the wall of the internal carotid artery. Therefore, preganglionic parasympathetic fibres to the Otic ganglion are carried in the Lesser superficial petrosal nerve.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
