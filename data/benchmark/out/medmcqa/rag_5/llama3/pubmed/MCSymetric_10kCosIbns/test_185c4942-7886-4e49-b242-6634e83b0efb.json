["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about amino acids that do not include post-translational modification. The provided documents describe different types of modifications on amino acids. Posttranslational covalent modification of proteins involves the addition or removal of groups from existing amino acid residues. Phosphorylated sites in substrates of intracellular protein kinases are a common feature, indicating that phosphorylation is a form of post-translational modification.\n\nThe text also discusses the aminoacylation of transfer ribonucleic acid, which does not involve post-translational modification. The primary question is about amino acids that do not undergo this type of modification. Upon reviewing the options, it becomes clear that Selenocysteine and Triiodothyronine are not amino acids in the classical sense, as they are not part of the standard 20-letter alphabet.\n\nHydroxyproline and Hydroxylysine, on the other hand, do undergo post-translational modification. Hydroxylation is a common mechanism that occurs after protein synthesis. Therefore, these two options can be eliminated.\n\nThe correct answer must be one of the remaining choices.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
