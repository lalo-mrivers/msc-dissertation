["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks to identify what is true about aneuploidy except. The given documents discuss aneuploidy of various types, including trisomy 21 and trisomy 18. According to the document 'Incidence of aneuploidy in a human population', it is mentioned that there is an epidemic component of the incidence superimposed on an approximately equal constant frequency. This suggests that aneuploidy has some relation with the progression of mother's age.\n\nThe document 'Genetics of aneuploidy in man reconsidered by banding studies' mentions that hypoploidy is more deleterious than hyperploidy, which implies that the severity of aneuploidy depends on its type. This does not necessarily imply a specific percentage of fetus dying in utero.\n\nThe document 'Twins with nonconcordant sexual aneuploidy' discusses twins with different abnormal karyotypes, including 48,XXXXY and 47,XXY, which suggests that there is a relationship between twinning and chromosomal anomalies. This does not necessarily imply a specific recurrence risk for nondysjunctional aneuploidy.\n\nThe document 'A general approach to genetic equilibria with an uneven sex ratio' discusses the distribution of autosomal genes in a diploid population at a genetic equilibrium, which is unrelated to aneuploidy.\n\nBased on these findings, it can be concluded that the correct answer is C: The occurrence of aneuploidy has no relation with the progression of mother's age.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
