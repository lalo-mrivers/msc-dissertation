["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The salivary secretions are formed by the product of protein synthesis within the glands and most of the known water and electrolyte exchange mechanisms. The morphology of salivary gland diseases suggests that the cyclic AMP and calcium ions localized in the glandular acini have an exceptional importance for the course of the secretory process, which is regulated by autonomic nervous system, quantity of perfusion, hydrostatic pressure in the blood capillaries, transepithelial active transport by ATP-consumed pump systems. The salivary secretion can be described as exocrine.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A: Exocrine and merocrine\"\n}"]
