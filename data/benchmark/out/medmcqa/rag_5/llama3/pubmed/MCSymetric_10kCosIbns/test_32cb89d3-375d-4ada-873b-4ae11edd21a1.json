["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the percentage of maxillary 1st molars that have two palatal roots. We need to find this information from the given documents. The document 'Morphologic study of the maxillary molars. 1. External anatomy.' tells us that the root lengths and root curvatures were quite similar on the first and second molars with their lingual roots curving toward the buccal on 54.6% and 52.3% of them, respectively. Complete separation of all three roots was observed on 86.4% of the first molars, 75.9% of the second molars and on only 18.8% of the third molars. This means that maxillary 1st molars do not have two palatal roots.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
