["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the metabolic homoeostatic role of muscle as a store of protein, acting as a great metabolic regulatory organ. The adaptation changes caused by systematic muscular activity relate to morphology and functional properties of the muscular fibre subcellular structures. Skeletal muscles adapt during growth and exercise to fit changing skeletal size, hypertrophy with overload, and increase oxidative capacity for endurance work. Daily swimming for 40 days increased weight of fast and slow muscles in white rats and altered the size of plane section and relative amount of different fibers in the muscles.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
