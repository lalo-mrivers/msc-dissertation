["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with features of hand wringing stereotype movements, impaired language and communication development, breath holding spells, poor social skills and deceleration of head growth after 6 months of age. We have documents related to rest-activity cycles, stereotyped behaviors, movement disorders in children, right-left orientation, and developmental progression in play behavior. From the given information, we can see that the patient's hand wringing stereotype movements are similar to the stereotyped hand waving observed in a mentally defective child, which was found to be driven by the basic rest activity cycle. The patient also presents with impaired language and communication development, poor social skills, and deceleration of head growth after 6 months of age, which are all consistent with Rett's syndrome. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is B: Rett's syndrome.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
