["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks which statement is not true for myelinated nerve fibers. The first document discusses the mathematical model of a myelinated fiber and how it relates to the properties of internodes. The second document describes the conduction-blocking concentrations of anesthetics on single myelinated fibers, while the third document presents quantitative studies on the regeneration of myelinated nerve fibers. The fourth document reviews the ion channel organization of the myelinated fiber.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom these documents, it is clear that impulse through myelinated fibers can be slower or faster depending on the properties of internodes and the presence of anesthetics (Option A). Membrane currents are indeed generated at nodes of Ranvier (Option B), which allows for saltatory conduction of impulses (Option C). Local anesthesia is effective in blocking nerve impulse conduction, regardless of whether the nerve is covered by a myelin sheath or not (Option D).\\r\\n\\r\\nTherefore, it can be concluded that Option A is not true for myelinated nerve fibers.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
