["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about signs of respiratory insufficiency. We need to identify what are considered as signs of respiratory insufficiency from the provided documents. One document talks about basic diagnostic criterions of respiratory insufficiency, which mentions arterial O2-partial pressure as a crucial criterion. Another document discusses functional and clinical differentiation of chronic respiratory failure, where it is stated that respiratory insufficiency is defined as hypoxemia due to bronchopulmonary disorders. Another document describes acute respiratory insufficiency and states that overall respiratory insufficiency is considered present when pO2 is less than 60 mmHg. Considering these points, we can deduce that hypoxia is a sign of respiratory insufficiency.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
