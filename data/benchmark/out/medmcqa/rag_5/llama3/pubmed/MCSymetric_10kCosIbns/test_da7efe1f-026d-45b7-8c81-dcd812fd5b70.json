["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the metabolism of vitamin K and its role in human nutrition. Vitamin K is a co-factor for post-translational carboxylation of specific glutamate residues to gamma-carboxyglutamate (Gla) residues in several blood coagulation factors. The regeneration of vitamin K in its coenzyme form is mentioned in the document 'Soluble enzyme system for vitamin K-dependent carboxylation'. According to this document, the soluble preparation is dependent upon the in vitro addition of vitamin K1 for carboxylating activity. This suggests that an enzyme is required to regenerate vitamin K from its reduced form.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: Epoxide reductase\"\n}"]
