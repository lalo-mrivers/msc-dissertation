["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has a well demarcated area of depapillation on his tongue that has been present since birth or for as long as he can remember. This suggests a congenital condition. Among the options, Median rhomboid glossitis is a rare condition that affects the posterior part of the tongue, but it's not usually present at birth. Geographic tongue is a common condition characterized by recurrent episodes of depapillation, which doesn't fit the patient's description. Black hairy tongue is also not a good match because it's typically caused by poor oral hygiene or other factors. Moeller's glossitis is another rare condition that can cause depapillation, but it's often associated with vitamin deficiencies or other systemic conditions. Given the congenital nature of the condition and the patient's age, the most likely diagnosis is B: Geographic tongue.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
