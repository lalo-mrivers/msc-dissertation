["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the strains present in a trivalent influenza vaccine. The relevant documents provide information on the development of live influenza vaccines with various strains. The A/Port Chalmers 1/73 and A/Victoria 3/75 live vaccines were well tolerated and showed good immunogenic properties, while A/New Jersey/8/76 and A/Victoria/3/75 strains were used in monovalent and bivalent influenza vaccines in Canada 1976. Since the question asks about the strains present in a trivalent vaccine, we need to look for information on trivalent influenza vaccines. However, none of the provided documents mention specific strains present in a trivalent vaccine. The document on 'Influenza: current concepts' mentions antigenic drift and shift, which affect the preparation of effective vaccines, but it does not provide information on specific strains.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
