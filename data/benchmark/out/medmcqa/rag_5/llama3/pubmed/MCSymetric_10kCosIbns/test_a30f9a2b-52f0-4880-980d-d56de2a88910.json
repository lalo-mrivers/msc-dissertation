["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks which property of dopamine is not helpful in acute shock. Dopamine's properties mentioned are alpha-1 agonist action leading to peripheral vasoconstriction (A), increase in renal perfusion due to agonist action on DI receptors (B), releases noradrenaline and causes positive inotropic effect (C), and direct action on heart beta-1 receptors (D). The text describes dopamine's ability to vasodilate the renal and mesenteric vessels, preventing acute renal failure. This suggests that option B is actually helpful in acute shock. Similarly, dopamine's ability to increase cardiac output and stroke volume is also beneficial for patients with cardiogenic shock.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
