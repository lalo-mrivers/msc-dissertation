["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about radiation effects on blood supply. From the provided documents, it can be inferred that high dosages of irradiation (600 R) caused changes in the flow capacity of the blood in vitro. However, there are no available studies on haemorheological parameters through ionizing rays in the literature. Additionally, animal experimental studies showed that extracorporeal blood irradiation could cause anaemia, but not hemolysis. There is also a study on tumor blood flow changes induced by chemical modifiers of radiation response, which suggests that certain agents can reduce blood flow.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
