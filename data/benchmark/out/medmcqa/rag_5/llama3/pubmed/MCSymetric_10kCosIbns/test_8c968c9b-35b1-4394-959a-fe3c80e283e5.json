["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, I found that rooting reflex, also known as search reflex, is a primitive reflex that is present at birth. This reflex helps newborns to find and grasp their caregivers' fingers. The document 'Reflexes and neurologists' does not specifically mention when this reflex disappears. However, another relevant document 'Soleus muscle reflexes evoked by stimulation of the posterior tibial nerve compared to tendon reflexes in man (author's transl)' describes the development of reflexes in infants, but it also focuses on the characteristics of soleus muscle reflexes and does not provide information about the disappearance of the rooting reflex. Therefore, I will rely on general knowledge that says that the rooting reflex typically disappears around 3-4 months of age.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
