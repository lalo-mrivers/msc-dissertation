["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the role of viral load done by Real Time PCR in investigative procedures. We need to identify the options that have a role for PCR in investigative procedures.\n\nFrom the given documents, we can see that PCR technology has its applications in detecting viruses in CSF, tissues, and blood. This information suggests that PCR is useful in investigating infectious diseases.\n\nConsidering this, option A (Person with hepatitis B on Tenofovir therapy) may have a role for PCR in investigative procedures as it relates to monitoring the efficacy of antiviral therapy.\n\nOption B (HSV causing temporal encephalitis) also has a potential role for PCR in investigative procedures as it involves detecting viral load in CSF samples.\n\nOption C (BK virus in patient of allograft renal transplant) may have a role for PCR in investigative procedures as it involves monitoring the viral load in patients who have undergone organ transplantation.\n\nOption D (CMV PCR in blood of patient of liver transplant) also has a potential role for PCR in investigative procedures as it relates to detecting and monitoring CMV infection in transplant patients.\n\nAfter considering these options, we can conclude that option C does not necessarily involve PCR in investigative procedures. While PCR may be used in allograft renal transplant patients, it is not the primary focus of investigation in this scenario.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C: BK virus in patient of allograft renal transplant.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
