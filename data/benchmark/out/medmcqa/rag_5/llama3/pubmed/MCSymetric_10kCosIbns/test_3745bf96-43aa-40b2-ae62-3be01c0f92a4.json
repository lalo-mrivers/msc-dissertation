["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with spontaneous abortion and secondary amenorrhea since then. FSH was found to be 6 IU/mL. We can refer to the documents provided. Group 1 patients have low values of both gonadotropin hormones, including FSH. Since the FSH value is 6 IU/mL, it's not extremely low, but rather within a normal range. However, since the patient has secondary amenorrhea, we can assume that there might be some underlying abnormality. Group 1 patients have low values of both gonadotropin hormones, which doesn't fit well with our patient's FSH value being 6 IU/mL. Therefore, we can rule out group 1. The documents also mention the importance of determining gonadotropin levels in serum for secondary amenorrhea. We can look at the other groups: Group 2 has low FSH and high LH values, which doesn't fit well with our patient's FSH value being 6 IU/mL. Group 3 has high FSH and high LH values, but that also doesn't match our patient's profile. Group 4 has normal gonadotropin levels, which might be a possibility. However, we need to consider the patient's history of spontaneous abortion and secondary amenorrhea since then.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
