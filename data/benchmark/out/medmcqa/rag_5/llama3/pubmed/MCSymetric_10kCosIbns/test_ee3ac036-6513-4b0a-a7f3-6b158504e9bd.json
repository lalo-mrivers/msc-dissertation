["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents provided are about various dental topics such as three-dimensional shape measurement of teeth, classification of single-rooted pulpless teeth, tooth supporting structure, endodontic morphology, and bonded retention. None of these topics directly relate to the minimum number of lobes required to form a permanent tooth. Therefore, we need to look for information that might be indirectly relevant. One possible connection is the anatomy of a tooth, which is discussed in the Endodontic Morphology paper. According to this study, the canals of molars present more difficulties than those of other teeth, but this does not provide information about the number of lobes required to form a permanent tooth. Another possibility is the Three-Dimensional Shape Measurement of Teeth paper, which discusses the measurement of teeth using CAD programs. This might be indirectly relevant if we consider the shape and structure of a tooth. However, even in this context, there is no specific information about the minimum number of lobes required to form a permanent tooth.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B: 2\""]
