["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking which component binds mRNA with the ribosome in prokaryotes. From the provided documents, it can be seen that the 3' terminus of 16S rRNA base pairs with the polypurine stretch common to initiator regions in E. coli and bacteriophage mRNAs. This suggests that the answer is related to the 16S rRNA or the ribosomal subunits. The document [Spatial proximity of the ribosomal mRNA binding center to the 50S subunit] also suggests that the mRNA-binding centre is located in the contact region between ribosomal subunits, which implies that it is not tRNA.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B: Shine Dalgarno sequence\"\n}"]
