["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the properties of myelinated nerve fibers. The provided documents discuss various aspects of myelinated nerve fibers, including their structure and function. Myelinated nerve fibers have a lipid-rich outer layer, which is mentioned in the document 'Order-disorder phenomena in myelinated nerve sheaths.' This suggests that option C: Outer layer is of lipids is correct.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, further analysis of the documents reveals that myelinated nerve fibers do not necessarily have slower conduction compared to non-myelinated fibers. The document 'Quantitative histometric studies and relation of number and diameter of myelinated fibres to electrophysiological parameters in normal sensory nerves of man' shows a linear relationship between nerve fiber diameter and conduction velocity.\\r\\n\\r\\nFurthermore, the documents do not provide any information about current discharges at nodes of Ranvier. The document 'Prerequisites for conduction in demyelinated fibers' discusses structural differences between nodal and internodal membrane, but it does not mention current discharges.\\r\\n\\r\\nFinally, depolarization occurs along the length of myelinated nerve fibers, not only at nodes of Ranvier. The document 'Spinal termination of functionally identified primary afferent neurons with slowly conducting myelinated fibers' shows that even relatively slowly conducting fibers (less than 40 m/sec) from high threshold mechanoreceptors and two types of low threshold mechanoreceptor can have terminals in the dorsal horn's marginal zone and in the ventral parts of the nucleus proprius.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn conclusion, option D: Depolarisation occurs only at nodes of Ranvier is incorrect. Option A: Conduction is slower in myelinated than in non-myelinated fibres is also incorrect because the conduction velocity depends on the diameter of the nerve fiber. Therefore, the correct answer is C: Outer layer is of lipids.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"]
