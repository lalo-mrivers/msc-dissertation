["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The brachial plexus is a complex network of nerves formed from the ventral rami of the 5th, 6th, 7th, and 8th cervical nerves and the 1st thoracic nerve. The document does not explicitly state that none of these parts give branches. However, it can be inferred that the roots do not give branches as they are described as contributing to the plexus.
