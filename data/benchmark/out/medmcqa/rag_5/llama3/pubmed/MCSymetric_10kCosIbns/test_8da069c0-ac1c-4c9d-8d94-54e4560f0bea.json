["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the materials used for making ear prosthesis and ocular prosthesis. From the provided documents, we can see that there is no specific information given about the materials used for making ear prosthesis. However, in the document [A preliminary prosthesis for the partially amputated hand], it is mentioned that an Orthoplast partial hand prosthesis is discussed and illustrated. This implies that a material called Orthoplast may be used for making hand prostheses. The document [Mechanical and systems approach facilitating facial prosthesis production] discusses specially designed equipment and color notation record, but does not specify the materials used for making facial prostheses. The document [Mandibular surgical prosthesis] talks about containment, immediate modelling and reconstructive prostheses, which do not seem to be directly related to ear or ocular prostheses.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
