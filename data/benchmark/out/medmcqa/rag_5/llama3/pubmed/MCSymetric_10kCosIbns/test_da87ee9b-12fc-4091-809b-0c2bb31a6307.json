["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents discuss various aspects of dental amalgam, including its dimensional changes during setting, structure, effects on clinical results, environmental aspects, concepts of retention, and microstructure of amalgam surfaces. It is clear that mechanical trituration is mentioned in the context of dimensional changes and surface finishes. The text suggests that varying degrees of trituration can affect dimensional change and porosity of the amalgam. Therefore, it is likely that mechanical trituration affects...\",\n\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
