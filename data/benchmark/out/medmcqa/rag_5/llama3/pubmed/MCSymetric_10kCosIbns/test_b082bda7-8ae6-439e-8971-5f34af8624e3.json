["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the changes that occur during exercise. We can rule out A as cerebral blood flow is not directly related to systolic blood pressure. Body temperature increases during exercise are a common phenomenon, so B is a possible answer.

Therefore, we can conclude that the correct answer is likely C.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
