["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about Weber-Fechner's law, which relates to the perception of external events. The relevant documents suggest that it is not the external event itself but rather uncertainty about the nature of the external event that produces neural activity. This revised mapping process implies that one perceives only those external events about which he was initially uncertain. Considering this concept, Weber-Fechner's law can be applied to understand the strength of stimulus perceived. The documents do not specifically mention Weber-Fechner's law, but it is a fundamental principle in perception and neural activity.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A: Intensity of stimulus\"\n}"]
