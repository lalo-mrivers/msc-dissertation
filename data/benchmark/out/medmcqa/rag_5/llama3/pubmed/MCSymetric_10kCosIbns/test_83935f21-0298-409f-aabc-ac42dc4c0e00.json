["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe different types of 'pockets'. In the first document, subcutaneous pockets are mentioned as a method to nourish a denuded, replanted end of a finger. There is no mention of simple, compound or complex pockets in this context. In the second and third documents, the term 'pocket' refers to the synthetic fabric used to manufacture clothing (trouser pocket) and prostheses (ungual prosthesis). The fourth document discusses the insertion of penile prosthesis using an infra-pubic incision, but does not mention pockets at all. Based on this information, it is clear that the question refers to the first document's description of subcutaneous 'pockets'. Therefore, I will choose an answer from options A-D that accurately reflects the terminology used in this context.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
