["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The study on Allergic reactions to long-term benzathine penicillin prophylaxis for rheumatic fever shows that life-threatening allergic reactions are rare. The study on Pharamcokinetics of rheumatic fever prophylaxis regimens suggests that benzathine penicillin G given every 4 weeks is an appropriate regimen for preventing the recurrence of rheumatic fever. However, the patient is penicillin-allergic and therefore benzathine penicillin G cannot be used. The study on Allergy to penicillin unsuccessfully treated with a haptenic inhibitor (benzyl-penicilloyl-N2-formil-lysine; BPO-flys) suggests that haptens may not always be effective in preventing reactions. Therefore, the best alternative is roxithromycin which has better pharmacokinetics than penicillin V and erythromycin stearate.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
