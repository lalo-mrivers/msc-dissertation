["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the structure of interglobular spaces within dentin. According to [Light and scanning electron microscopic studies of structure of dentin interglobular spaces (author's transl)], these regions are mineral-free, containing an organic matrix with a smaller amount of ground substance and a smaller number of collagenic fibrils than found in mineralized dentin. Since the documents do not mention any PAS reaction or any other staining technique being used to detect specific molecules within interglobular spaces, option A is the most relevant.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
