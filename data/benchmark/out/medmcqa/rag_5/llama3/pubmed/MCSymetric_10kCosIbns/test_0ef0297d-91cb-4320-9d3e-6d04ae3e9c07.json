["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the given documents, protein synthesis is discussed in different contexts. In one document, it's mentioned that amino acids were attached directly to the 'messenger' RNA along the backbone as 2'OH aminoacyl esters. This suggests that the process of protein synthesis has evolved over time. The origin of the protein synthesis mechanism is considered in four successive steps. These steps include the development of DNA, mRNA, and ribosomal RNA (rRNA). Ribosomes are not mentioned as part of the early protein synthesis system. Therefore, it can be inferred that ribosomes may have evolved later in the process. Protein synthesis is also discussed in eukaryotic cells, where numerous factors are involved in the processes of initiation, elongation, and termination.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
