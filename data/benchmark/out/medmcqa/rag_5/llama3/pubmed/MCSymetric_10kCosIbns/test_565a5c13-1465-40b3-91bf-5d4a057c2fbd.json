["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe models as a way to study biological systems for medical purposes. In 'Modeling of biological and medical systems: a systemic strategy', it is mentioned that models can be used for simulation, which can help deepen and improve knowledge about the observed system. This suggests that models are an aid in understanding and predicting physiological processes. Additionally, in '[The interaction of the medical researcher with other scientists]', it is mentioned that physicians must use models to work on basic problems such as diagnosis, prognosis, treatment, epidemiology, public health, management of health services, etc. This implies that models can be used for planning and decision-making in medicine. Therefore, based on these documents, it seems that study models are primarily used as an aid in understanding and predicting physiological processes, which supports option C.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
