["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about Jersey finger, which is a type of avulsion injury that occurs when the extensor tendon of the little finger is torn away from the bone. Looking at the provided documents, none of them specifically mention Jersey finger. However, in 'Replantation of a torn-off little finger', it mentions a rare case where almost all the extrinsic and intrinsic muscles of a finger were avulsed, which sounds similar to the concept of Jersey finger. Therefore, we can infer that the answer is related to an injury involving the extensor tendon of the little finger. Among the given options, only D: Extensor indicis proprius (which is actually the wrong term for the extensor tendon of the little finger) seems relevant.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
