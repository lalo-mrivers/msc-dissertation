["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to the principles of cryosurgery, the mechanism by which a cryogen destroys cells is complex. The formation of a hemispherical iceball composed of thermogradients, each of which maintains a temperature proportional to its distance from the application point, initiates the cryoinjury. This indicates that cell death occurs when the temperature falls below a certain threshold.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
