["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), which is characterized by a low platelet count. The documents highlight the autoimmune nature of ITP, mentioning cellular and humoral autoimmune reactions. Platelet-specific auto-antibodies are mentioned in [Clinical picture, pathophysiology and therapy of idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (author's transl)]. As ITP is an immunologically-related thrombocytopenia, it makes sense that platelet-specific auto-antibodies are involved. A prolonged bleeding time is a consequence of low platelet count in ITP, as mentioned in [Therapy of immune thrombopenia]. Immunotherapy is indeed often used to control ITP, as seen in [Therapy of immune thrombopenia] and [Immune thrombocytopenic purpura: an overview]. Hemophilia is a different condition characterized by prolonged bleeding due to clotting factor deficiency. In contrast, ITP causes a prolonged bleeding time due to low platelet count. Therefore, option D seems incorrect.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
