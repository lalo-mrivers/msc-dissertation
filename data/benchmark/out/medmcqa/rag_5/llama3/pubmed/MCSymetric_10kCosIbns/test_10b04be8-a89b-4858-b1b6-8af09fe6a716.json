["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the provided documents, it can be inferred that the major mechanism of transport of drugs across biological membranes is passive diffusion. The Systems approach to study of solute transport across membranes using suspension cultures of mammalian cells III: steady-state diffusion models document states that general physical models are derived for the diffusional transport of drugs across membranes of mammalian cells in culture suspension, representing different sets of possible physical processes taking place during the transport of a drug molecule. Additionally, the Kinetics of drug transport and concurrent metabolism in human cell cultures I: theory document assumes linear kinetics and states that the time course solutions for the drug and its metabolite are given in terms of macroscopic constants, which further supports passive diffusion as the major mechanism.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
