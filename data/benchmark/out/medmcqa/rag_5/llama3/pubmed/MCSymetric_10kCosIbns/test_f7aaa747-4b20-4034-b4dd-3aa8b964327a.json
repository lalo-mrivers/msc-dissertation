["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about which type of malignancy is least commonly associated with lymphatic spread. The provided documents discuss the metastasis of malignant tumors through the lymphatic system. The initial lymph vessels of the skin play a role in the metastasizing potential of a malignant tumor, and the density of lymphatic vessels can affect the seeding of tumors via the lymphatic system. This suggests that the type of malignancy itself is important in determining its ability to spread through the lymphatic system. Therefore, we need to look at the characteristics of each type of malignancy and how they relate to lymphatic spread. Basal Cell Carcinoma is a non-aggressive tumor that typically does not metastasize, whereas Malignant Melanoma is an aggressive tumor that can spread through the lymphatic system. Squamous cell carcinoma can also metastasize through the lymphatic system, but its frequency of lymph node involvement may be lower than that of Malignant Melanoma. Merkel Cell Carcinoma is a highly aggressive and metastatic tumor that often spreads to regional lymph nodes. Therefore, based on the characteristics of each type of malignancy, we can conclude that Basal Cell Carcinoma is the least commonly associated with lymphatic spread.\",\n\"answer_choice\": A"]
