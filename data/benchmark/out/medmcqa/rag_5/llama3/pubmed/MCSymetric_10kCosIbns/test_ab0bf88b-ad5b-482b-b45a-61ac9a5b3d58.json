["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the drainage of the maxillary sinus. In the provided documents, we can find that irrigation of the maxillary sinus is a common procedure for removing its contents. The anterior route has been termed the canine fossa technique and is the only one suited for use in a child whose sinus is underdeveloped. This suggests that the maxillary sinus drains into the canine fossa. Additionally, in the document 'Elimination of contrast medium from the maxillary sinus', sniffing facilitated drainage more than blowing but the effect was minimal except when sniffing was performed with the head tilted to the side opposite the filled sinus. This implies that the maxillary sinus drains through the anterior wall.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
