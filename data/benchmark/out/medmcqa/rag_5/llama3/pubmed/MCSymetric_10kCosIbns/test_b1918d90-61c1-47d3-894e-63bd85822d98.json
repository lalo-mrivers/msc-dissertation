["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the mechanisms that mediate rapid axonal flow. The provided documents discuss different aspects of axonal transport, including fast axonal transport, slow component b (SCb) of axonal transport, and the composition of transported proteins. Fast axonal transport involves the movement of newly synthesized material along microtubules by motor proteins such as kinesin and dynein. SCb is a slower form of axonal transport that also involves microtubules and motor proteins. Neurofilaments are structural components of the axon, but they do not directly mediate rapid axonal flow. Therefore, based on the information provided, neurofilaments are the mechanism that is most likely to be excluded from mediating rapid axonal flow.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
