["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant document that provides information about lactose levels in human milk is 'Metabolites of lactose synthesis in milk from women during established lactation'. According to this study, the mean concentration of lactose was 198 mM (175-233). Since we are looking for a percentage value, we need to convert this value into grams. The molecular weight of lactose is approximately 342 g/mol. Therefore, we can calculate the number of moles of lactose as follows: number of moles = concentration in M x volume in L. However, since the volume is not provided in the document, we cannot perform this calculation. Instead, we can compare the given concentrations with a standard value. According to another study ('Lactose in blood in nonpregnant, pregnant, and lactating women'), the concentration of lactose in breast milk during established lactation was 30 +/- 8 microM. This is different from the values provided in 'Metabolites of lactose synthesis in milk from women during established lactation'. Therefore, we cannot determine a specific percentage value based on these studies.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"None of the above\""]
