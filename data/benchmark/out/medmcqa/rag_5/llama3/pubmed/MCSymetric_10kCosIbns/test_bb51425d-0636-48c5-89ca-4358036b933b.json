["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the effect of multiple firing on the opaque layer of dental porcelain. Based on the provided documents, specifically [Tensile strength of dental porcelains], it mentions that conventional dental ceramics did not differ significantly in their mechanical properties. There is no mention of multiple firing affecting the opaque layer of porcelain. Hence, we can rule out options A and B. The document does not provide information about the effect of multiple firing on the opacity of the porcelain either, so option C is also unlikely. Therefore, considering all the available information, the most plausible answer would be that if multiple firing is done to opaque layer of dental porcelain then it becomes Crack.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
