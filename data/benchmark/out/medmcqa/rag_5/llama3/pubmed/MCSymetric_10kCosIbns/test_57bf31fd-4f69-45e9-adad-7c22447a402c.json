In this case, we are looking for a scenario that could lead to uncontrolled bleeding during oral prophylaxis. We can see from [Dental care for patients being treated with oral anticoagulants] that patients receiving oral anticoagulants may be at risk of bleeding complications, and it is important to evaluate the risk of bleeding complications against the medical risk for the patient in case of interruption of the anticoagulant therapy.
