["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The provided documents describe the articular disc of the TMJ. Based on the first document 'Biomechanical properties and collagen fiber orientation of TMJ discs in dogs', it is mentioned that the surface of the disc has an undulated configuration which aids in storing synovial fluid and providing lubrication to the joint. The fine fibrils in the middle part are twisted together tightly, presenting a wavy, winding, lamina layer structure anteroposteriorly that works to absorb shock. There is no mention of thickness being greater posteriorly or strengthened by lateral pterygoid. Therefore, the description does not support options A and C. The second document 'Observation of the articular disc' does not provide any information regarding the thickness of the articular disc. However, it does suggest that the disc alters with age, which may affect its thickness. Nevertheless, this information does not contradict the original description provided in the first document.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
