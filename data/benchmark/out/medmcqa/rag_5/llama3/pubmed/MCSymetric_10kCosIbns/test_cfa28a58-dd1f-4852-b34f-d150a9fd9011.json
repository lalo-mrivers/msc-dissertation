["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking to identify the false statement about snake-bites. We need to analyze the provided documents to determine which option does not match with the information presented. Based on the documents, we can see that brown snakes (genus Pseudonaja) are responsible for 11 deaths, tiger snakes (Notechus scutatus) for four, taipan (Oxyuranus scutellatus) two and death adder (Acanthophis australis) one. We do not find any information about humpnosed pit viper bite in the provided documents. Therefore, option A is false as there is no information about anti-venom being ineffective in humpnosed pit viper bite.\n\nThe documents also mention that cobra venom is neurotoxic (Option B).\n\nAtropine premedication should be used before administering Neostigmine to counteract the effects of the latter's muscarinic and nicotinic antagonism, which could be beneficial in cases like krait bites. This information is not explicitly stated but it can be inferred that option C and D are correct as both Atropine and Neostigmine have roles in krait bite treatment.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that the false statement about snake-bites is A: Anti-venom is not effective in humpnosed pit viper bite.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
