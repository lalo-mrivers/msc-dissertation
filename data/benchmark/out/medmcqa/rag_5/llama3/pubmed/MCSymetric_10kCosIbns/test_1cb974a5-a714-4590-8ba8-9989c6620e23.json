["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to the documents, the development of the tongue begins as known, in the floor of the primitive oral cavity, when the human embryo is four weeks old. More specifically, the tongue develops from the region of the first three or four branchial arches during the period that the external face develops. This suggests that the correct answer is not related to these stages. B and D are both swellings, which do not match with the description in the documents.

Therefore, the only remaining option is A: Tuberculum impar, which is not mentioned in the development process of the tongue.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
