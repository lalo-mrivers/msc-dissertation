["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe osteosarcoma as a primary malignant bone disease that can be suspected on the basis of x-ray findings. The signs of malignancy mentioned include bone lesions larger than 6 cm with blurred outlines, showing patterns of destruction resembling moth-eaten textiles, and revealing spicula or Codman's triangles. This information suggests that the usual radiographic appearance of an osteosarcoma is not a discrete radiolucency with regular borders (A) nor a multicystic radiolucency with a soap bubble appearance with an irregular peripheral border (B). The sunburst pattern with radiopaque strands extending from the cortical plates (C) is also unlikely, as it is typically seen in Ewing's sarcoma. Therefore, the correct answer must be D: Cotton wool appearance with an irregular peripheral border.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
