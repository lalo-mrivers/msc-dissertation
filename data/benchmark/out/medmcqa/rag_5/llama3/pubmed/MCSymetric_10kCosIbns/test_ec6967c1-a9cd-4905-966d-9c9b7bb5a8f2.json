["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the treatment plan for a parasymphysial fracture in a 55-year-old man. The relevant document is 'Management of parasymphyseal fractures of the mandible'. According to this document, open reduction and internal fixation was required in patients having severe comminution, a mobile central fragment, or bilateral subcondylar fractures. Since this information is not provided for our patient's specific case, we should look at other relevant documents.

Open reduction and internal fixation is recommended when there is severe comminution or a mobile central fragment.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
