The relevant documents discuss pulpal distress, pulpitis chronica clausa, and diagnostic procedures for evaluating pulpally involved teeth. Acute pulpitis is mentioned in 'Pulpitis chronica clausa, diagnosis and therapy' as a process that results from clinical observation. This document suggests that pulpitis chronica clausa can be examined by histological findings and the literature. It also discusses etiological, nosological, and pathohistological differentiation of this process. According to 'Diagnosis and treatment of pulpal distress', diagnosis is made in terms of probability, and treatment must also be a probability. No one can guarantee that the diagnosed degree of pulpal distress is accurate.
