["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, I will refer to the relevant document 'Short-forms of the UK WAIS-R'. According to this document, regression equations were built to predict full-length IQ from a series of short-forms. The short-forms ranged from a two-subtest version proposed by Silverstein (1982) to a seven-subtest version proposed by Warrington, James & Maciejewski (1986). Regression equations, their standard errors of estimate and confidence intervals are presented as well as IQ conversion tables.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
