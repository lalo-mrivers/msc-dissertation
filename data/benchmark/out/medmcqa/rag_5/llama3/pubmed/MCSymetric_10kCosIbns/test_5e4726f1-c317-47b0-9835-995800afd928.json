["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant document that provides information about the composition of early plaque is 'Scanning electron microscopy and energy-dispersive X-ray microanalysis studies of early dental calculus on resin plates exposed to human oral cavities.' According to this study, early dental calculus formed after 10 days on resin plates was mainly divided into three types: A, B, and C. The type A deposits showing an average Ca/P molar ratio of 1.42 were densely packed with fine needle-shaped crystals formed by the intra- and extra-cellular calcification. This indicates that calcium and phosphorus are present in early plaque. Additionally, lithium, strontium, fluoride, and zinc contents were inversely related to plaque mass, which suggests that these elements may also be present in the plaque.\n\nIn heavy calculus formers, it is likely that the proportion of Ca, PO4, and K would be dominated by calcium and phosphorus as they are the primary components of early dental calculus. The document 'Plaque minerals and caries experience: associations and interrelationships' provides evidence for the inverse associations between DMFT and total calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, strontium, potassium, and fluoride concentrations in individual plaques.\n\nBased on these findings, it can be inferred that in heavy calculus formers, early plaque consists of Ca, PO4, and K in the proportion: Calcium > Phosphorous > Potassium.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
