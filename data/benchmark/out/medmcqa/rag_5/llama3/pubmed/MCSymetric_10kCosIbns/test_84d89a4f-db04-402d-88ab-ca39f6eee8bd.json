["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents discuss the relationship between heart rate and respiratory rhythm. The first document suggests that the inspiratory off-switch peaks are located in the middle or second half of the R-R interval, indicating a possible connection between heart rate and inspiratory off-switches. The second document clusters respiratory variables into four groups: magnitude, speed, variability, and relative change. One factor is associated with tidal volume (VT) and inspiratory duration (TI), which are related to the respiratory rhythm generation center. The third document discusses serial dependence of respiratory cycle characteristics, suggesting that the respiratory centers may exhibit short-term memory. Finally, the fourth document describes a free-running endogenous rhythm of the resting heart rate, indicating that the heart rate is influenced by an internal oscillator. Based on these findings, it can be inferred that the respiratory rhythm generation center is located at the pre-Botzinger complex.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
