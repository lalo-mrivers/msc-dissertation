["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking which lipoprotein does not move towards the charged end in electrophoresis. We can look at the documents for information on how different lipoproteins behave during electrophoresis. From the first document, we know that the beta mobility region comprises a surface potential range of -4.5 to -7.0 mV, and the alpha mobility region a range of -10.5 to -12.5 mV. This suggests that charged particles will move towards the negative end. Chylomicrons are not mentioned in this context. From the other documents, we see that VLDL, LDL, and HDL are all separated by electrophoresis based on their charges. Therefore, it is likely that these lipoproteins would also move towards the charged end.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
