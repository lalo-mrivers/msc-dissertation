["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the factors that affect the hardness of stone surface. From the given documents, we can see that the hardness of dental stone and improved dental stone is increased significantly by either method when prepared with aqueous solutions of potassium salts (K2SO4, KCl, KF, KBr, KNO4, KMnO4, K2Cr2O7) in concentrations of 0.5-5.0%. The most effective hardening solution is potassium sulphate in concentrations of 0.5-5.0%. So, the answer should be related to this information.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
