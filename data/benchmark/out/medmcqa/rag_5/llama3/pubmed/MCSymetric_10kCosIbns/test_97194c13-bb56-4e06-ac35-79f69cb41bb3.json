["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the storage temperature of RBC, Platelet, and FFP. We can find the answer by analyzing the relevant documents. The first document talks about freezing technique and quality of fresh-frozen plasma. It doesn't provide information on storage temperature. The second document discusses the influence of temperature on blood coagulation in vitro. It shows that coagulation factors are affected by temperature, but it's not specific to RBC, Platelet, or FFP. The third document is about the effect of heat inactivation and freezing on fatty acid composition of plasma and red blood cells. It doesn't provide information on storage temperature. The fourth document discusses the effect of heating on the osmotic fragility of stored blood. It shows that incubation at 46Â°C for 1 hour does not cause red cell damage, but it's not specific to RBC, Platelet, or FFP either. Therefore, we need to look elsewhere for the answer. The documents don't provide specific information on storage temperature, so we cannot make a definitive conclusion based on these documents.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
