["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to the provided documents, T-lymphocytes are central to the physiopathological mechanism of most dysimmunity affections. They also play a key role in cellular immunity. Subsets of T lymphocytes and their interactions with other immune cells, such as lymphocytes B and macrophages, are crucial for modulating the immunocellular response. The documents highlight recent advances in characterizing T cell subsets and their detection using various techniques. Furthermore, the induction of secondary cytotoxic T-lymphocytes in vitro does not require cell proliferation, suggesting that T-lymphocytes can function independently without significant cellular division.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
