["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the sharpest cusp. Based on the documents provided, we can see that the Barakwena group had significantly larger protocone values than the Vassekela group in maxillary molars. The study indicates that the protocone was the largest cusp in M2. Additionally, the document 'Application of \"cusp writer\" findings to practical and theoretical occlusal problems. Part II' states that the steepness of the curve of Spee determines the relative cusp height and angulation of one tooth to another. Therefore, we can conclude that the sharpest cusp is likely seen in maxillary molars, specifically M2.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
