["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Renal osteodystrophy is a metabolic bone disease resulted from chronic renal failure. The relevant documents highlight the role of hyperphosphatemia, hypocalcemia, and deficient 1,25(OH)2D3 in inducing secondary hyperparathyroidism, which is a hallmark feature of renal osteodystrophy.
