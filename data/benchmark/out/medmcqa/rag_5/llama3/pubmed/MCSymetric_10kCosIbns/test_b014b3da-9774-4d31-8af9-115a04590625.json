["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the biopsy of a clinically suspicious lesion that turns out to be negative. We need to consider the possibilities of malignancy being present but undiagnosed by biopsy. The significance of biopsy in patients with osteoarticular tumors suggests that needle biopsy may not be adequate for diagnosing malignant tumors, and open biopsy might be needed. Similarly, the analysis of occult malignant tumors in dermatologic disease shows that radiological screening failed to detect any occult neoplasms unless specific clinical findings suggested carcinoma in a particular organ system. This implies that biopsy might be necessary for accurate diagnosis. Considering these points, we should not rely solely on biopsy results.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
