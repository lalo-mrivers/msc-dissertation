["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the activation of naive T cells. The relevant documents describe various ways to activate cytotoxic function in T lymphocytes, including Con A, specific alloantigen, and third party-stimulating cells. The data suggest that there are multiple ways to activate T cell triggering, which minimizes a strict informational function of antigen-receptor interactions. Additionally, the synergy between naive and memory T cells during activation is discussed, with both subsets being activated to the same extent by alloantigen. None of the other options (NK cell, dendritic cell, macrophage, B-lymphocyte) are mentioned in the provided documents as playing a role in activating naive T cells.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
