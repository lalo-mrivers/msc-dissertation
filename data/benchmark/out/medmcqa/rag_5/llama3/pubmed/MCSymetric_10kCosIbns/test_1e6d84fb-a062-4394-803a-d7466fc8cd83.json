["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, particularly the last one 'An X-ray crystallographic examination of calcium phosphate formation in Ca(OH)2/H3PO4 mixtures.', we can infer that dicalcium phosphate monohydrate is formed at a specific pH range. The document suggests that the initial precipitates are amorphous or poorly crystalline, and they change to brushite as the Ca/P ratio decreases from approximately 1.2-1.0. Since dicalcium phosphate monohydrate has a specific composition, we can conclude that it is formed at a certain pH range where the Ca/P ratio is within the specified range. However, there is no direct correlation between phosphoric acid percentage and the formation of dicalcium phosphate monohydrate.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
