["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about measuring variation between two different units. The relevant documents mention standard deviation, variance, coefficient of variation, and range. However, the context suggests that we are looking for a measure that compares variation between two different units. Standard deviation and variance are measures of spread within one unit, while range is simply the difference between the maximum and minimum values. Coefficient of variation is a relative measure of variability, but it still applies to one unit. Therefore, I conclude that the correct answer must be a method that directly compares variation between two different units.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"]
