["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the branches of the external carotid artery in Kiesselbach's plexus. We need to analyze the documents provided to identify which option is not a branch of the external carotid artery in Kiesselbach's plexus.\\n\\nFrom [Sympathetic innervation of the carotid bifurcation in the rabbit and cat: blood vessels, carotid body and carotid sinus. A fluorescence and electron microscopic study.] we can see that the branches of the external carotid artery include the Sphenopalatine aery.\\n\\nHowever, none of the provided options (A, B, C, D) match with the information provided in this document. Therefore, we need to look for any other relevant information.\\n\\nFrom [C5 collaterals of the internal carotid siphon: embryology, angiographic anatomical correlations, pathological radio-anatomy (author's transl)]. we can see that there is no mention of Kiesselbach's plexus or its branches.\\n\\nFrom [Innervation of the carotid body, types of nerve endings and their possible significance.]. we can see that it only talks about the innervation of the carotid body and does not provide any information about Kiesselbach's plexus.\\n\\nFinally, from [A structure in the wall of the internal carotid artery in the rat.]. we can see that it only talks about a structure found in the wall of the internal carotid artery and does not provide any information about Kiesselbach's plexus.\\n\\nFrom [Innervation of the human internal carotid arteries under normal conditions and in stenosis]. we can see that it talks about the innervation of the internal carotid artery but does not provide any information about Kiesselbach's plexus.\\n\\nAfter analyzing all the documents, we can conclude that none of the provided options (A, B, C, D) are mentioned in any of the documents. Therefore, we cannot determine which option is not a branch of the external carotid artery in Kiesselbach's plexus based on the provided information.\\n\\nHowever, if we assume that Kiesselbach's plexus refers to the sphenopalatine ganglion (as it typically does), then we can see from [Sympathetic innervation of the carotid bifurcation in the rabbit and cat: blood vessels, carotid body and carotid sinus. A fluorescence and electron microscopic study.] that Sphenopalatine aery is indeed a branch of the external carotid artery.\\n\\nThis means that option B (Sphenopalatine aery) should be eliminated as it is already identified as a branch of the external carotid artery.\\n\\nBased on this analysis, we can conclude that option C: Greater palatine aery is not mentioned in any of the provided documents and is therefore likely to be the correct answer.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"]
