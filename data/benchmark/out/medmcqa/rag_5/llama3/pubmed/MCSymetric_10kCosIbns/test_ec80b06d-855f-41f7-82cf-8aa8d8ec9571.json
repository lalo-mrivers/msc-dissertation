["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the attachment of Group 2 sensory fibres. We need to find information about Group 2 sensory fibres in the provided documents. According to the document 'Physiological properties of primary sensory neurons appropriately and inappropriately innervating skeletal muscle in adult rats', Group 2 sensory fibres are mentioned as stretch-sensitive afferents that could be divided into in-parallel or in-series receptors. The in-parallel receptors outnumbered the in-series receptors by approximately 3:2. This suggests that Group 2 sensory fibres are likely to be attached to muscle spindles, which are sensitive to stretch.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
