["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question describes a patient who is unable to name things and has poor repetition. However, comprehension, fluency, and understanding written words are unaffected. This suggests that the patient's language production is impaired, but his language comprehension remains intact. Based on this information, we can rule out options C (Transcortical sensory aphasia) and D (Conduction aphasia), as these types of aphasia typically affect both comprehension and production. We are left with options A (Anomic aphasia) and B (Broca's aphasia). Anomic aphasia is characterized by difficulty naming specific objects, which fits the patient's symptoms. Broca's aphasia is characterized by difficulty articulating words and speaking in sentences, but understanding written words remains intact, which also fits the patient's symptoms.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
