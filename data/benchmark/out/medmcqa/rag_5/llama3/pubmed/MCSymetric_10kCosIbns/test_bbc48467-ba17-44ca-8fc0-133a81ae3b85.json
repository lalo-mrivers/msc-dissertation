["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe growth and development during adolescence. The study on lean body mass and fat in adolescent boys shows that there is a high correlation between measurements made during the first and eighth years of study, indicating a strong relationship between age and growth velocity. Additionally, the maximum yearly increment in height, weight, and lean body mass coincides in time. These findings suggest that hormone-driven growth is likely to play a role in muscle mass increase at adolescence.\n\nThe document on skeletal muscle function in young rats shows that undernutrition affects contraction force and endurance time, while sex difference affects different muscles differently. This suggests that hormonal influences may also affect muscle development during this period.\n\nThe adolescent growth spurt study describes the growth velocity of boys and girls and finds a strong correlation between age and growth velocity. The study also notes that the adult sex difference in height is due more to the later take-off point in boys than to a greater male adolescent spurt. This suggests that hormonal influences may drive some of this growth velocity.\n\nGiven these findings, it appears likely that hormones play a role in increasing muscle mass at adolescence. Specifically, growth hormone and thyroid hormone are both known to play roles in regulating growth and development during this period.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C: Growth hormone.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
