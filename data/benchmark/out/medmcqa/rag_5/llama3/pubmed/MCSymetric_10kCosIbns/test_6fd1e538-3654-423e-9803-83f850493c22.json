["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The cell membrane is freely permeable to three ions X, Y, and Z. At resting membrane potential, the respective equilibrium potentials of X and Y are -30mV and -40mV. This means that there are more negative charges (X and Y) inside the cell compared to outside. When a drug is infused that can block the permeability of Z, it will affect the movement of ion Z across the membrane. Since Z is being blocked, its equilibrium potential will no longer be affected by changes in its concentration gradient. The resting membrane potential is determined by the sum of the equilibrium potentials of all ions, including X and Y. As there are more negative charges (X and Y) inside the cell, the resting membrane potential will be -30mV (from X) + -40mV (from Y) = -70mV. With Z being blocked, its contribution to the resting membrane potential is eliminated, resulting in a depolarization.\",\n\"answer_choice\": A"]
