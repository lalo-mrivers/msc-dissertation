["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about a crab claw separator. The provided documents are about various topics such as species identification, shell disease, metal content of blue crabs, and the anatomy of dog claws. None of these topics seem to be related to crab claw separators. Therefore, I will look for any keywords or phrases that might be relevant to the question.
