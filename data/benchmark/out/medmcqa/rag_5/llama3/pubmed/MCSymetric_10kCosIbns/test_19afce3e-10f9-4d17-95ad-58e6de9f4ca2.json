We need to find a relevant document that provides information about this topic. Let's review the documents provided. The Morphologic study of the maxillary molars. Part II: Internal anatomy. and Root canal morphology of mandibular premolars seem to be related to root canals, but they don't provide information about Accessory Canals. On the other hand, C-shaped canal configurations in mandibular molars mentions continuous hemorrhage and sensitivity were encountered when instruments were used, which might be related to Accessory Canals.

The [The relations of the mandibular canal with the outer surfaces of the body of the mandible and the risks which arise from its injury] seems unrelated to this topic. Finally, Morphologic study of the maxillary molars. 1. External anatomy. doesn't provide information about Accessory Canals either. Let's summarize: we have three documents that don't seem to be relevant, one document that mentions something related but doesn't provide a clear answer, and no other documents provided. Therefore, based on the available information, we can't determine the correct answer.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
