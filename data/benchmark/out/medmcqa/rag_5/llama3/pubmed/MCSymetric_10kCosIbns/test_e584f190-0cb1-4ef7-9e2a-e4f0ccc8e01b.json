["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the olfactoretinalis system (ORS) as a cluster of FMRF-amide immunoreactive neurones located on the olfactory nerve and bulb. The ORS projects to the olfactory bulb and optic nerve but not to the olfactory epithelium. In contrast, the terminal nerve is a small substance P or GnRH immunoreactive fibre bundle which originates from a ganglion located rostrally to the olfactory epithelium, courses caudally with the olfactory nerve and terminates as glomeruli in the olfactory bulb. The terminal nerve appears to be a cranial nerve, clearly distinct from the ORS.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
