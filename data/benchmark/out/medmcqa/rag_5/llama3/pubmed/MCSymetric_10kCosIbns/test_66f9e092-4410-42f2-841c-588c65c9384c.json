["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to the documents provided, establishing reference values can be done using Gaussian or nonparametric techniques. The standard deviation is a measure of precision that is widely used in clinical chemistry. Additionally, data should be checked for outliers and these should be eliminated if they are not an integral part of the data. Given this information, we can conclude that mean and standard deviation can only be worked out if data is on interval/ratio scale because nominal, dichotomous, and ordinal scales do not have a concept of mean and standard deviation.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
