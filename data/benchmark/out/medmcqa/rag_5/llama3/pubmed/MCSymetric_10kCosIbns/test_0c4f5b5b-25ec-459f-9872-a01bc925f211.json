The [Normal values and diagnostic reliability of laboratory tests] document discusses the importance of understanding biologic parameters, their nosological meaning, statistical distribution in a population, and concepts of Normality. This does not provide direct information on NESTROFT test either.\n\nThe only relevant information is from the [Multiple serial examinations by means of rapid tests in Brandenburg 1974] document which discusses mass miniature radiography and biochemical parameters for detecting various diseases including anaemias. No specific mention of NESTROFT test or its application.\n\nThe [Quality of sweat test performance in the diagnosis of cystic fibrosis] document is unrelated to hematology or NESTROFT test.\n\nGiven this information, it appears that there is no direct connection between the provided documents and the specific choices for NESTROFT test. Therefore, it's not possible to determine which option is correct based on the given documents.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"None of the above\""]
