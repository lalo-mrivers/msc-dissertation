["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks to find the range in which 95% of the population would be lying. To solve this, we need to use the mean (25 mm Hg) and standard deviation (10 mm Hg). The z-score is a measure of how many standard deviations an individual score is from the mean. For 95% of the population, the z-scores range from -2 to +2. This means that for 95% of the population, the IOP would be within 2 standard deviations of the mean. In this case, it would be between 25 - 20 = 5 mm Hg and 25 + 20 = 45 mm Hg. However, since we know that the intraocular pressure in normal subjects is a dynamic parameter with spontaneous variations of pulsatory, respiratory, vasomotoric and diurnal type, and the range of pressure of an eye is more important than a definite value which is true for the moment only, we should consider the diurnal variation as well. According to the literature, the normal value during the day in healthy, young adults is about 12 +/- 2 mm Hg. Therefore, we can consider a range of 14-10 = 4 mm Hg and 12 + 2 = 14 mm Hg for the diurnal variation. This would result in a range of 25 - 20 - 4 = 1 mm Hg to 25 + 20 + 2 = 47 mm Hg.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D\n}"]
