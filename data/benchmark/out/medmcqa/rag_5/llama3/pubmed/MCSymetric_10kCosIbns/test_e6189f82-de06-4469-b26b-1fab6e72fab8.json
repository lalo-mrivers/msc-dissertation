["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient developed chest pain and collapsed after an argument with his brother. The hospital declared him dead on arrival. This scenario is similar to the one described in [Emergency treatment in chest trauma (author's transl)]. In this document, emergency treatment includes measures taken by the medical officer to prevent further damage, intubation, suction drainage, artificial ventilation, and evacuation of fluid from the pleural cavity, mediastinum, and pericardium. Considering that the patient was declared dead on arrival, it is unlikely that these measures were taken. Therefore, we can rule out options B, C, and D, which are all related to chronic cardiomyopathy.\n\nThe fact that the patient developed chest pain after an emotional upset suggests a possible psychogenic component. This is supported by the concept of 'psychogenic death' described in [Psychogenic death and suicide (author's transl)]. In this scenario, a person may die quietly due to external factors, which fits with the patient's sudden collapse.\n\nHowever, we need more information to confirm the diagnosis. The case report on 'Suicide pact in a depressed elderly couple' suggests that psychogenic death can be related to depression and suicide. However, this is not relevant to our patient's case.\n\nBased on the available information, the most likely diagnosis is psychogenic death.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
