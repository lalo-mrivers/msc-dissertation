["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe various types of luxation injuries, including cervical spinal luxation. In [Immediate and delayed luxation of lower cervical vertebrae (author's transl)], surgical realignment via the anterior access route, with intercorporeal spondylodesis, is mentioned as a treatment option. This implies that fixation period may be longer than just a few weeks.\n\nIn [Fracture luxation of the cervical spine. Different treatments], different therapeutic procedures are discussed, including decompressive laminectomy and anterior fibula bone graft, which also suggest a longer fixation period.\n\nThere is no specific information on fixation period in the other documents.\n\nBased on this analysis, it seems that fixation period for intrusive luxation injuries may be around 4-6 weeks, given the need for surgical realignment and stabilization.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: 6 to 8 weeks\"\n}"]
