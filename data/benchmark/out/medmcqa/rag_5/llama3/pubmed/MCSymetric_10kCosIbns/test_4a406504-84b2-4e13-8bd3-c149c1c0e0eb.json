["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the given documents, we can see that the lung recoil is directly proportional to the change of muscle length in the relaxation maneuver. This means that when the chest wall and lung recoil are balanced at a relaxed state, it must be related to the change of muscle length during this state. According to the Effect of respiratory muscle tension on lung volume document, the shortening of the cranial-caudal distance between a rib pair and the sternum was measured during a relaxation maneuver. This implies that the chest wall and lung recoil are balanced at the resting position or the relaxed state, which is represented by the FRC (Functional Residual Capacity).\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
