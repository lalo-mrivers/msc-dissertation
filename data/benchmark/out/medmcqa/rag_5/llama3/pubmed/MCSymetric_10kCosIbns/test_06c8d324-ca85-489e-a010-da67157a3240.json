["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents suggest that tetracycline can cause tooth discoloration when given over long periods of time. The study on Dose and age dependent variations in effect of tetracycline on enamel formation in rat suggests that the effect of TC on enamel varied with age of the animal, and that the higher the concentration of antibiotic, the higher the incidence of defects. This implies that a high dose of tetracycline may cause tooth discoloration. The study on Tetracyclines: double blind clinical study to evaluate the effectiveness in periodontal surgery does not provide information related to tooth discoloration. Therefore, we can conclude that a high dose of tetracycline is likely to cause tooth discoloration.\n\nThe study on Tooth discoloration resulting from long-term tetracycline therapy suggests that when given over long periods of time in adults, the tetracycline molecule is incorporated into the continuously forming secondary dentin. It is possible that chronic sun exposure of the incorporated tetracycline may cause the formation of a reddish-purple oxidation product, resulting in discoloration of the permanent teeth.\n\nThe study on On the relationship between tetracycline and the incremental lines in dentine does not provide information related to minimum dosage of tetracycline which will show tooth discoloration.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D: 80 mg/kg body weight\"}"]
