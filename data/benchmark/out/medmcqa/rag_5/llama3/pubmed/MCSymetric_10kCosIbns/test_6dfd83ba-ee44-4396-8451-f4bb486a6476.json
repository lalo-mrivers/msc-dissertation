["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the factors that affect the accuracy of fit of denture bases. The [Accuracy of fit of the denture base depending on various jaw geometries. Biotechnical analysis] document highlights the importance of the shape of the denture base and its relationship with the alveolar ridge, which can affect the expansion or contraction of acrylics during polymerization. This suggests that an accurate fit of the denture base is crucial to prevent overload. Since small bases would actually reduce the risk of overload, this option can be ruled out. The other options, however, describe possible scenarios where the denture base could be subjected to increased stress and potentially cause overload.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
