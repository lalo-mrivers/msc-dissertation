["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The study [Bacteremia following tooth extractions] indicates that streptococci are the bacteria isolated most frequently after dental extractions. Antibiotic sensitivity studies show that these bacteria are sensitive to penicillin and erythromycin, but resistant to streptomycin. Therefore, penicillin would be the antibiotic of choice for treatment of post-extraction bacteremia, with erythromycin as a substitute in patients allergic to penicillin. Since the patient has heart disease, it is likely that prophylactic antibiotics are being considered to prevent bacterial endocarditis. Based on the sensitivity studies, amoxicillin (a combination of penicillin and beta-lactamase inhibitor) would be an appropriate choice.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
