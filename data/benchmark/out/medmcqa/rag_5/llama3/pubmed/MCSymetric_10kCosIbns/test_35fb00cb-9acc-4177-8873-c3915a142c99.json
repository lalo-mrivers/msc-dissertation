["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about a yeast that can exist as a yeast at 37°C and hyphae at 25°C. This information is not provided in the given documents. However, we can look for clues about the growth conditions of various yeasts. For instance, the document 'Thermal adaptation in yeast' states that obligate psychrophilic yeasts are obligate aerobes and cannot grow anaerobically at higher temperatures. On the other hand, obligate thermophilic yeasts are facultative anaerobes and can grow anaerobically at higher temperatures.\n\nFrom this information, we can infer that a yeast that grows as a yeast at 37°C is likely to be an obligate thermophile, whereas one that grows as hyphae at 25°C is likely to be an obligate psychrophile. With this in mind, let's examine the given options:\n\nA: Histoplasma capsulatum - This fungus can grow as yeast-like cells called pseudohyphae or true hyphae depending on the growth conditions. However, it does not fit the exact criteria of growing as a yeast at 37°C and hyphae at 25°C.\n\nB: Sporothrix globosa - This fungus grows as hyphae in vivo and can grow in vitro under specific conditions. It also fits the given criteria, but its growth conditions are not well-suited for industrial applications.\n\nC: Candida albicans - This yeast is an opportunistic pathogen that can grow as a yeast or pseudohyphae depending on the environment. While it does not fit the exact criteria of growing as a yeast at 37°C and hyphae at 25°C, it is a significant human pathogen.\n\nD: Cryptococcus neoformans - This fungus grows as encapsulated yeasts that can form hyphae under certain conditions. However, it does not fit the given criteria.\n\nIn conclusion, while none of the given options exactly match the given criteria, Sporothrix globosa seems to be a good candidate due to its ability to grow as hyphae in vivo and under specific in vitro conditions.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
