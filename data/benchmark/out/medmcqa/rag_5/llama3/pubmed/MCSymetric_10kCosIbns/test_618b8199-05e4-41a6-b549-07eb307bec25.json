["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with a persistent productive cough and clubbing. On auscultation, wheeze and crackles are present. This suggests that the diagnosis is likely to be related to chronic lung disease or bronchial asthma. The question asks for the most specific investigation to confirm the diagnosis. Based on the provided documents, we can eliminate options C (Chest X-ray) and D (MRI) as they do not provide specific information about bronchial hyperreactivity or airway inflammation.
