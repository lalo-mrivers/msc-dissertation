["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe anaerobic infections of the head and neck region caused by various bacteria. According to the texts, Bacteroides sp (Bacteroides melaninogenicus group, Bacteroides oralis, and Bacteroides fragilis group), Peptostreptococcus sp, and Fusobacterium sp predominate in head and neck infections. Moreover, another document states that the pathogenicity of these organisms is expressed through their ability not only to survive penicillin therapy but also to shield penicillin-susceptible pathogens from the drug. Therefore, it can be concluded that Bacteroides sp are likely involved in anaerobic infections of head and neck region.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
