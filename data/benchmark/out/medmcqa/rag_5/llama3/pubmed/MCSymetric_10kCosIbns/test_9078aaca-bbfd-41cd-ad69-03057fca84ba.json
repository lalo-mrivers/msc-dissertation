["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the characteristics of venous blood flow in lower limbs using duplex Doppler. From the provided information, we can infer that the characteristic of venous blood flow is biphasic or triphasic, as it allows for both morphological and hemodynamic information to be obtained. Additionally, the document 'Doppler ultrasonography for detection of deep vein thrombosis in lower extremities' mentions a specificity of 92% and sensitivity of 100% for detecting DVT, indicating that the technique is capable of detecting different flow patterns.\", \"answer_choice\": B}"]
