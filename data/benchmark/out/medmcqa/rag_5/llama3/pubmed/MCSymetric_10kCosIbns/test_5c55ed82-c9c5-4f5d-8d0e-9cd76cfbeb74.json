["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents provide information on pregnancy diagnosis, prenatal care, and fetal development. At 6 weeks, a diagnosis of bleeding (hemorrhage) is required. The first document compares eight kits for diagnosing pregnancy and detects various hormonal components in urines. The third document discusses the rise of tentative pregnancies and mentions mass screening using technologies like ultrasound scanning.\n\nConsidering these points, the most accurate and safe method to diagnose bleeding pregnancy at 6 weeks would likely involve a non-invasive and widely accepted technique. Doppler assessment of fetal cardiac activity is not explicitly mentioned as a diagnostic tool for pregnancy complications like hemorrhage.\n\nUrinary Beta-hCG determination could be an option, but it primarily detects pregnancy rather than specifically diagnosing bleeding.\n\nPer vaginal examination of uterine size corresponding to 6 weeks gestation may not accurately detect bleeding or identify the cause.\n\nTherefore, USG (ultrasound) for fetal cardiac activity seems a reasonable choice, as it is a widely accepted and non-invasive method that can provide valuable information on fetal development and potentially diagnose complications like hemorrhage at an early stage.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
