["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The provided documents describe various aspects of chromatin, including its composition, structure, and behavior under different conditions. The main points that can be inferred from these documents are the presence of histone H1 in chromatin, the release of a minor chromatin fraction with increased RNA and non-histone protein content upon digestion with micrococcal nuclease, and the presence of stable and unstable non-histone proteins in different chromatin fractions. The documents also describe the properties of chromatin extracts from mammalian nuclei and the degradation of chromatin during nuclear isolation.\n\nFrom these points, it can be concluded that the disappearance of nuclear chromatin is not directly mentioned in any of the provided documents. Therefore, the correct answer would be D: None.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
