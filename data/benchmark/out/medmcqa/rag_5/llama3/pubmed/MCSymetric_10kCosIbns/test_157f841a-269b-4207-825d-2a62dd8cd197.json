["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the provided documents, we can see that there are several studies on fetal adrenal steroidogenesis. In 'Steroid production by definitive and fetal zones of the human fetal adrenal gland', it is mentioned that corticoids were found to be secreted primarily by the definitive zone, while DHAS was found to be the main secretory product of the fetal zone. However, there is no direct information on the maximum steroid produced by fetal adrenal in this study.\\n\\nIn 'Biosynthetic pathways for corticoids and androgen formation in human fetal adrenal tissue in vitro', it is mentioned that pregnenolone was used as a substrate and incubated with midterm fetal adrenals. The order of magnitudes of enzyme activity when progesterone was used as a substrate was 17alpha-hydroxylase, 21-hydroxylase, and 16alpha-hydroxylase. This study does not provide direct information on the maximum steroid produced by fetal adrenal.\\n\\nIn 'Sex differences in fetal sheep adrenal steroidogenesis', it is mentioned that corticosterone formation was similar in both sexes, whereas cholesterol formation was significantly higher in female than in male adrenals. This study also mentions that testosterone and estradiol were synthesized at higher rates in female than in male adrenals.\\n\\nIn 'Fetal rat adrenal steroidogenesis and steroid transfer to adrenalectomized mother', it is mentioned that 11-deoxycorticosterone, 18-hydroxy-11-deoxycorticosterone, corticosterone, and 11beta-hydroxyprogesterone were identified in the plasma of injected fetuses. However, this study does not provide direct information on the maximum steroid produced by fetal adrenal.\\n\\nIn 'Adrenal gland growth of the ovine fetus in the end of gestation: evolution of DNA and of membrane proteins', it is mentioned that the adrenal weight of the ovine fetus increases dramatically during late pregnancy. This study does not provide direct information on the maximum steroid produced by fetal adrenal.\\n\\nBased on the provided studies, we can infer that the fetal adrenal gland produces various steroids, but there is no clear indication of the maximum steroid produced.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
