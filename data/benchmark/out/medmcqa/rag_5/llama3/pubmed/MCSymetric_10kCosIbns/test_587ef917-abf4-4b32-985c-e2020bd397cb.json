["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about anaerobic glycolysis of which produces 3 ATPs per unit glucose consumed. From the provided documents, it seems that we need to focus on glycolysis reactions and their energy yields. The calorimetric study mentions heat production connected with lactate formation being about 17 kcal (71 kJ) per mol lactate formed, which corresponds to the sum of heat production due to the formation of lactate from glucose and the heat production due to neutralization.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
