["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks which of the given options doesn't have any effect on pancreatic secretion. We can start by reviewing the provided documents. The first document mentions that rapid intravenous injection of pancreozymin (1 Crick-Harper-Raper U per kg) stimulated secretion of total protein and hydrolases within 1 min. This stimulation was of short duration and had a half-life of 70 to 100 sec. Rapid intravenous injection of caerulein (20 ng per kg) induced a similar response. Parallel variations in total protein, amylase, lipase, and chymotrypsinogen(s) were observed in the three experiments where complete enzyme analyses were performed. Therefore, CCK and Caerulein both have an effect on pancreatic secretion.\n\nThe second document discusses the exocrine function of a healthy human pancreas. It states that administration of 2% HCL or secretin (1.5 mu/kg) increased the volume of juice by 30 ml in the following hour without changes in the activities of amylase and lipase. Therefore, Secretin also has an effect on pancreatic secretion.\n\nThe third document is about non-parallel enzyme secretion from rat pancreas in vitro studies. It states that stimulation with secretin, cholecystokinin-pancreozymin (8 ID u.kg-1) or pilocarpine (15 mg kg-1) both resulted in a significant change in the enzyme proportions in the juice. Therefore, CCK-PZ also has an effect on pancreatic secretion.\n\nThe fourth document is about the effect of glucagon on pure human exocrine pancreatic secretion. It states that glucagon had an inhibitory effect on pancreatic secretion. Therefore, Glucagon also has an effect on pancreatic secretion.\n\nThe fifth document discusses secretion of fluid and amylase in the perfused rat pancreas. It states that stimulation with secretin caused marked sustained fluid but only a small sustained amylase secretion following an initial transient. This suggests that Secretin also has an effect on pancreatic secretion.\n\nFrom the above, it can be seen that all options except one have an effect on pancreatic secretion: Gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP). GIP is not mentioned in any of the provided documents as having an effect on pancreatic secretion.\", \n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
