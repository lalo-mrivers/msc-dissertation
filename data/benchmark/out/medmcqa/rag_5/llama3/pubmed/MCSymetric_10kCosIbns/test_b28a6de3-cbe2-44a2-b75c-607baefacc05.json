["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about rapid sequence induction in a cardiac patient in an emergency. From the given documents, there is no information specifically related to this topic. However, we can make an educated guess based on general anesthesia practices. Rapid sequence induction typically involves inducing agent and neuromuscular relaxant administered together (option A), pre-oxygenation before the procedure (which may vary depending on the patient's condition), cricoid pressure maintained until the endotracheal tube has been secured with a cuff (option C). The choice of inducing agent and muscle relaxation medication is also crucial. Succinylcholine is commonly used for rapid sequence induction, but it should not be given alone; a hypnotic such as thiopentone sodium is usually co-administered.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
