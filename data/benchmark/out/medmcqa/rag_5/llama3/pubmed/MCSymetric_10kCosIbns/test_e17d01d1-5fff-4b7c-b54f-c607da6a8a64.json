["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the growth of nasal bone. The relevant documents are about the growth pattern of rabbit nasal bones, bilateral aplasia of the nose, hypoplasia of the nasal bones, and the embryonic development of the lateral nasal wall from 8 to 24 weeks. The documents suggest that growth at the proximal and distal borders was similar (6.79 mm and 6.19 mm respectively), while growth at the lateral border was slower (2.73 mm) and at the medial border was even slower (1.22 mm). This suggests that the nasal bone grows mainly in its proximal-distal direction. There is no information provided about the age of completion of growth, but we can look for any references to human development or growth milestones. The only relevant document mentioning human development is 'The embryonic development of the lateral nasal wall from 8 to 24 weeks', which does not provide information on when growth is completed. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact age by which growth of the nasal bone is completed.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
