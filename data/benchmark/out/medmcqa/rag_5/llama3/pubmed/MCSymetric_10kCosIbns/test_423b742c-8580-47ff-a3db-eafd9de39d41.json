["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the disease caused by the organism found on stool microscopy. The relevant documents mention recurrent abdominal pain in children, which is a common problem. However, they don't provide information about specific organisms or their causes of abdominal pain. Therefore, we need to look for other relevant information. Upon reviewing the documents, I find that there are no specific findings mentioned that would suggest an intestinal parasite as the cause of abdominal pain. However, the documents do mention recurrent abdominal pain in children and its possible causes, including organic and functional causes. This suggests that the possibility of parasitic infection causing recurrent abdominal pain is not explicitly mentioned. Therefore, we need to look at the potential choices provided.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
