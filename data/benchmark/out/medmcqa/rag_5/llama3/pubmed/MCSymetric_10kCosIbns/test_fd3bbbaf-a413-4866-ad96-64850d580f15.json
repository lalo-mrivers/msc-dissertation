["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about resorbable GTR materials, which are used to facilitate guided tissue regeneration. We can find the answer by reviewing the documents provided. The first document discusses bone regeneration using the principle of GTR and mentions that alloplastic materials are used to fill periodontal defects. This suggests that non-resorbable materials like PTFE (D) might be used. The second document does not provide information about resorbable GTR materials, but it presents results on healing of experimentally created defects in the calvaria of rabbits using guided bone regeneration. The third document discusses regeneration procedures, including flap debridement and grafting materials, but does not specifically mention resorbable GTR materials. However, it does mention irradiated-crosslinked human collagen membrane as a material used for GTR, which is likely to be resorbable.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
