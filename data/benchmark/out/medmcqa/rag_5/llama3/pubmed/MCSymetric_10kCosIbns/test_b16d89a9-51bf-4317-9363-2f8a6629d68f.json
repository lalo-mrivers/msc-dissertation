["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the absorption of fluoride in children. From the provided documents, it is clear that urinary fluoride excretion has been studied in small children following ingestion of F tablets or fluoridated salt (F-salt) containing 500 mg F/kg NaCl. It is also mentioned that after taking 0.5 mg F in the form of NaF tablets, a group of children without previous F supply attained within 1 d a 24-h urinary F concentration which was about the same as that in children who had been taking caries-preventive tablet doses for years. This suggests that fluoride is absorbed by the body and excreted through urine.\",\n\"answer_choice\": A"]
