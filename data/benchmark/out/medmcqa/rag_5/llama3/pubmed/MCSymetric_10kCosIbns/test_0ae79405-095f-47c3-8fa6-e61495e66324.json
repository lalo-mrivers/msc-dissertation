["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant document is 'Effect of anaerobiosis and glucose on the content of haem and its precursors in intact yeast cells.' It states that the 'efficiency' of the first enzyme of the haem biosynthetic pathway--delta-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) synthetase--expressed as the sum of all intermediates of the pathway, is similar in anaerobic and aerobic cells. This suggests that the TCA intermediate used in haem synthesis is likely to be one of the early intermediates.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
