["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Upon reviewing the provided documents, there is no mention of 'split finger technique'. However, I noticed that one document discusses reconstruction of the central slip of the extensor tendon of a finger. This procedure involves using the lateral band and attached intrinsics of an adjacent finger to correct congenital absence of the proximal interphalangeal joint extensor mechanism. The term 'finger' is used in this context, but there is no mention of 'split'. Therefore, I conclude that the technique being described is not related to splitting a finger.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"None of the above\""]
