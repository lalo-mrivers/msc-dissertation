["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about a pure histological landmark for termination of cleaning, shaping, and obturation. Based on the provided documents, it seems that the answer should be related to dental anatomy. The [Comparative research on the treatment of exposed bi- or trifurcations] document mentions apical constriction as a specific rough root surface in relation to individual systems. This information suggests that the apical constriction might be a landmark for termination. Additionally, the [Direct and indirect pulp capping] document discusses direct pulp capping and presents a format based on scientific data and clinical evidence. This provides further support for considering apical constriction as a histological landmark.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
