["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe different types of TMJ clicks, including reciprocal clicks. One document mentions an anterior displacement of the disk (Farrar) and a posterior displacement of the disk (Klett). Another document describes clicking due to overstraining of the lateral ligament or muscle between the tuberculum articulare and collum mandibulae. Since the initial clicking is while opening, it is likely related to the movement of the condyle in respect to the articular disc. Based on the descriptions of the types of derangements causing TMJ clicks, we can rule out a perforated disk (C) or lateral displacement of the condyle (D). The other options seem more plausible.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
