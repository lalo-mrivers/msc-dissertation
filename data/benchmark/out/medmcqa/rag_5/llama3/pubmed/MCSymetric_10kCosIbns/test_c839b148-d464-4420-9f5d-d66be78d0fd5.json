["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about staging of GTN (Good Tips Needed) with lung metastasis. We need to analyze the relevant documents provided to answer this question. From [Modalities and interest of preoperative staging in primary lung cancer], we know that a careful clinical examination determines the need for complementary examinations providing decisive information for or against interventions. Systematic lung endoscopy should consist of staged biopsies. Mediastinoscopy estimates the locoregional extension in a more satisfactory manner than angiography or lung scintigraphies.\n\nFrom [Small-cell lung tumors: is a more accurate staging possible and useful?], we can see that small cell lung cancer is generally staged as a localized or diffuse disease due to its great invasiveness and quick spread. The authors investigated the advantages of a more accurate staging by TNM system applied to small cell lung cancer.\n\nFrom [Screening, staging, and diagnostic investigation of non-small cell lung cancer patients], we know that anatomic staging by the International TNM Staging System has shown its effectiveness in directing the appropriate therapeutic interventions and predicting prognosis. Anatomic staging cannot be completely accomplished by computed tomography scans or magnetic resonance imaging of the chest.\n\nFrom [Distribution of lung metastases in the axial plane], we can see that the vast majority of lung metastases are to be found at the periphery of the lung, irrespective of cavitation or of their shape or size. This distribution cannot be explained by hydro-dynamic factors, but may be related to the susceptibility of metastases in different parts of the lung.\n\nConsidering all these documents, we can conclude that staging of GTN with lung metastasis is likely to be a Stage 2\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
