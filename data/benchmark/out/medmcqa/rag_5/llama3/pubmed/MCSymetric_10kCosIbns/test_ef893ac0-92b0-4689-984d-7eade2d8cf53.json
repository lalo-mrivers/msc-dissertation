["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the primary cause of repeated fracture of a porcelain fused to metal restoration. The relevant documents discuss various aspects of porcelain-fused-to-metal restorations, including repair techniques, dimensional changes after fusion, distribution of stresses, and factors affecting debonding forces. One document mentions that microcracks, flaws, and voids inside the metal-porcelain restoration may cause the restoration to fracture in service, with corrosive components of the oral environment enhancing crack growth. This suggests that repeated fracture might be related to cracks or defects within the restoration. The question's focus on repeated fracture implies that the primary cause is likely not a one-time event, but rather an underlying issue that leads to multiple fractures.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
