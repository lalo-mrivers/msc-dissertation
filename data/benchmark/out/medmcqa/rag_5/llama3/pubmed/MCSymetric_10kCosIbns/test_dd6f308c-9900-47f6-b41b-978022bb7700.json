["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The child can walk upstairs one step at a time, which suggests that their gross motor skills are developed. They can also ride a cycle, indicating further advancement in their physical abilities. However, they cannot jump, which may imply some delay or immaturity in this area. Additionally, the child can speak sentences and tell their name and gender, showing decent language development. The only area of difficulty is narrating a story, which could be due to cognitive or language delays. Considering these factors, it's essential to look at general developmental patterns. None of the provided documents provide a direct correlation between physical abilities, language skills, and story-narration abilities. However, we can draw some inferences from the documents.\n\nThe 'Developmental patterns of visually handicapped children' article suggests that 10-12 months is when sighted children start to outstrip visually handicapped children in most developmental areas. This divergence increases with age. However, it's essential to note that this study focuses on visually handicapped children and may not directly apply to this child.\n\nThe 'Language and social behaviour in severely educationally subnormal children' article shows a strong positive relationship between age and the number of social interactions a child initiates during a typical classroom free-play period. This could imply that the child's social skills are more advanced than their physical or language abilities, which might be delayed.\n\nConsidering these points, it's challenging to pinpoint an exact developmental age without further information about this child. However, based on the provided documents and the presented facts, I would suggest that the child is likely between 2-3 years old.\", \n\"answer_choice\": \"B: 2\""]
