["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The article emphasizes that a statistically significant difference does not prove the existence of a difference. It only establishes that if no difference existed, there was less than 5% chance that the results obtained would have occurred. In this case, the study found no statistically significant association between two variables. This means that there is only a small chance that the null hypothesis (no association) is true. However, we cannot conclude with certainty that no association exists because the power of the statistical test may be low. Therefore, even if the p-value is greater than 0.05, it does not necessarily mean that a difference truly does not exist.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
