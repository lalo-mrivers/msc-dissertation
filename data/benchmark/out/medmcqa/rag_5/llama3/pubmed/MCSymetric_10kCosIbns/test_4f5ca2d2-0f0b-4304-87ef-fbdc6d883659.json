We can see from the document on 'Falls and lying helpless in the elderly' that 12% of men and 19% of women aged 65 years or over who sought medical attention after a fall lay where they fell for 15 minutes or more after falling. This suggests that there may be some physiological changes that occur when people lie down. Additionally, we can see from the document on 'Relaxation technique to increase comfort level of postoperative patients' that relaxation techniques are used to reduce muscular tension and lead to an increased comfort level of postoperative patients. This implies that lying down can affect blood pressure, pulse, and respiratory rates.

This suggests that there may be some changes to the airways when people lie down.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
