["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to the documents, during exercise in physiological limits, end-systolic volume (ESV) response is closely related to changes in left ventricular end-diastolic volume (r = 0.84). Additionally, despite a decline in ventricular filling at peak exercise, systolic function appeared to improve dramatically (change in left ventricular ejection fraction 15.5 +/- 6.4, P < 0.0001). This suggests that ESV might decrease during exercise.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A: ESV decreases\"\n}"]
