["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the best distribution to study the daily admission of head injury patients in a trauma care centre. The relevant documents are the ones provided earlier. One document talks about the incidence of head injuries as patients attended a general hospital Accident & Emergency Department, which implies that there might be a pattern or trend in the data. Another document mentions that most cases came to hospital after 5:00 p.m., especially at weekends, which suggests that there might be variations in the daily admission patterns depending on the time of day.
