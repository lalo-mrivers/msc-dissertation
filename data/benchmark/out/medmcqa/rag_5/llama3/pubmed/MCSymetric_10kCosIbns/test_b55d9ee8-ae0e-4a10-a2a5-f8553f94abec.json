["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about White radiating Lines. The relevant documents are mainly related to laser radiation effects on skin tumors, infrared spectroscopy for tracing ointment vehicles and active substances, morphology of epithelizing varicose ulcers following He-Ne laser therapy, dermatoplasty in treatment of late radiation injuries of the skin, and diagnostic procedures of the skin. After reviewing these documents, it seems that none of them directly mention White radiating Lines or any similar phenomenon related to skin lesions. However, one document mentions infrared spectroscopy which can be used to trace different substances such as potent allergens on healthy or diseased skin. This might lead us to consider a possibility that the White radiating Lines are not a type of skin lesion but rather an effect of radiation exposure. We should look for any information in the documents about radiation-related effects on skin.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
