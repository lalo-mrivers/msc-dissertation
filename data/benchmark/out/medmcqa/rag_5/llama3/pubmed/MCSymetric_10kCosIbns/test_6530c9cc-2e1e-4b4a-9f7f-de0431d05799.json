["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents discuss cell-to-cell membrane channels or intercellular junctions. Specifically, the first document mentions permeable contacts between epithelial cells, while the fourth document describes vesicles and tubules involved in transport phenomena across the mesothelial barrier. The fifth document discusses adhesion molecules and tight junctions formation between brain endothelial cells. The key to answering this question is understanding what type of intercellular junction allows for exchange of cytoplasmic molecules between two cells. Based on the provided information, we can infer that gap junctions are likely to be the correct answer.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
