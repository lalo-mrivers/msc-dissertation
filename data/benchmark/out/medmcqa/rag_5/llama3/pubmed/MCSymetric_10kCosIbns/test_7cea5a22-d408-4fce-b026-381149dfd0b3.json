["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents suggest that orientation is affected by the discrepancy between vestibular and visual systems of coordinates.

This implies that the center of rotation during intrusion is likely to be at infinity, as there would be no visual input to influence the orientation.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
