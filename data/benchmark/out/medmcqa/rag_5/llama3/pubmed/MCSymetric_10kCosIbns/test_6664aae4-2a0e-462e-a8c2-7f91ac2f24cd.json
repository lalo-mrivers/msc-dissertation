["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The most important but nonspecific regulator of iron metabolism is discussed in the document 'Coordination of cellular iron metabolism by post-transcriptional gene regulation'. According to this document, a single genetic regulatory system orchestrates the expression of proteins with central importance for all three aspects of cellular iron metabolism at the level of mRNA stability and translation. This regulatory system involves a cis-acting mRNA sequence/structure motif called 'iron-responsive element' (IRE) and a specific trans-acting cytoplasmic binding protein, here referred to as 'IRE-binding protein' (IRE-BP). IRE-BP is highly homologous to the iron-sulphur (Fe-S) protein aconitase which strongly suggests that IRE-BP is an Fe-S protein itself. Control over IRE-BP activity by the cellular iron status is exerted post-translationally and likely involves changes between (4Fe-4S) and (3Fe-4S) states of the postulated IRE-BP Fe-S cluster.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
