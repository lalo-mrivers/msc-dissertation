["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents suggest that the spatial distribution of chromosomes 1 and Y in human spermatozoa are closely associated with a vacuole. In tertiary trisomic male mice, the extra chromosome aggregates with the sex chromosomes during first meiotic prophase. Additionally, studies on Robertsonian translocations in laboratory mice show an association between unpaired sex chromosomes and spermatogenic failure. From this information, we can infer that independent assortment of maternal and paternal chromosomes likely occurs at a stage where the sex chromosomes are not paired. This suggests that it may occur during the primary spermatocyte to secondary spermatocyte stage.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
