["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking which feature of Binder's syndrome is NOT characteristic. We need to review the relevant documents to identify the features associated with Binder's syndrome. From [Malformations of the spino-cervical joint and of the cervical spine associated with Binder's syndrome (author's transl)], we know that malformations of varying importance are found in 53.5% of cases, including those related to the cervical spine and spino-cervical joint. This suggests that Binder's syndrome is not just about maxillo-nasal dysplasias. From [Binder's syndrome: peculiarities in Japanese patients], we know that the diagnosis can be difficult based on facial appearances alone, and that midface retrusion and flattened nasal bridge are normal in Japanese individuals. Finally, from other sources, we know that Class III malocclusion is a characteristic feature of Binder's syndrome.\", \"answer_choice\": B}"]
