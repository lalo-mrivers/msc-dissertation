["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents provide information on the principles of pulse oximetry, measurement methods, and instruments. Pulse oximetry is based on the difference in absorbance between oxygenated and deoxygenated arterial blood when exposed to light waves of different wavelengths. The principle is described in [Pulse oximetry: theory and applications for noninvasive monitoring], which states that pulse oximeters compute SaO2 by measuring differences in the visible and near infrared absorbances of fully oxygenated and deoxygenated arterial blood.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
