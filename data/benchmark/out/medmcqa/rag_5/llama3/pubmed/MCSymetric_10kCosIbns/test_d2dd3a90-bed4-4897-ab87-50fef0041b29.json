["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis. We need to look for relevant information from the provided documents that describes the inflammatory lesions of the R.A.-joints. In [Possible role of immune-phenomena in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis], it is mentioned that locally deposited, complement activating immune-complexes participate in the inflammatory lesions of the R.A.-joints by inducing the release of hydrolases from phagocytic cells. This event is also mediated by lymphokines and complement factors. In [Recent concepts on the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis], it is mentioned that the evidence implicating an immune pathogenesis of the lesions of rheumatoid arthritis suggests that the disease occurs in two phases, an initial phase associated with the presence of an exogenous initiating agent and a chronic, apparently self-prepetuating phase maintained by the presence of an autoantigen. The documents suggest that inflammation is related to immune-complexes and lymphokines.\", \"answer_choice\": B}"]
