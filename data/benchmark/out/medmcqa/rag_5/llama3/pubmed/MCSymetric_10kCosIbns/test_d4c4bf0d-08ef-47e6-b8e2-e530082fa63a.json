["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks which drug should not be given to a patient with narrow-angle glaucoma. From the provided documents, we can see that sympathomimetic drugs are discussed as potential treatments for glaucoma. Adrenaline is mentioned specifically, but it's used in combination with miotics and doesn't seem relevant here. Beta-blockers like Timolol are also discussed as a treatment option. Acetazolamide is mentioned as having lower effective concentrations than usual in long-term treatment. Homatropine is an anticholinergic agent that can increase intraocular pressure, which would worsen narrow-angle glaucoma. Phenylephrine is not explicitly discussed but it's similar to adrenaline and would likely have the same effects. Given this information, we should look for a drug that increases intraocular pressure or worsens narrow-angle glaucoma. This points to Homatropine.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
