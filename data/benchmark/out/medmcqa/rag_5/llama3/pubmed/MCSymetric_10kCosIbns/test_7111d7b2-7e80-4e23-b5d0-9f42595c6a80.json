["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the binding of 2,3-BPG to haemoglobin sites and its effect on oxygen affinity. According to the documents, 2,3-DPG (a compound designed to fit a site of known structure in adult human haemoglobin) binds to the DPG receptor site of human adult deoxyhaemoglobin. This binding causes a shift in the oxygen dissociation curve. The size of the shifts are expected to be in the sequence expected from the postulated numbers of interactions made by each compound with each haemoglobin type, based on the assumption of a common receptor site for the three compounds.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
