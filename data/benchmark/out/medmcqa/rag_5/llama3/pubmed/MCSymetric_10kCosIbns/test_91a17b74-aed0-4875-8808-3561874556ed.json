["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, I will examine each option carefully. Actinomycin D is an antibiotic that interferes with DNA replication and transcription. It is a cell-specific agent, but it is not a monoclonal antibody (which are proteins that specifically recognize and bind to a particular antigen). Therefore, option A is incorrect. Option B states that Actinomycin D is not cell specific, which is actually true - it targets cells in the DNA synthesis phase of the cell cycle, making it a cell cycle-specific agent. Vinblastine is an alkaloid that disrupts microtubule formation and function, causing mitotic arrest. It is also a cell cycle-specific agent, but it does not specifically target only one type of cell (it can affect various types of cells). Therefore, option C is incorrect. None of the above options accurately describe malpractice in medicine, which is what the provided documents are about.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
