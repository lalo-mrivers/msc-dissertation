["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents highlight the distribution of dental fluorosis in primary and permanent teeth. According to the 'Distribution of dental fluorosis in the primary dentition' document, the severity of dental fluorosis is lower in deciduous teeth compared to permanent teeth. This suggests that deciduous teeth do not show fluorosis or have a significantly lower fluoride content. The 'Electron probe microanalysis of fluorine content in deciduous and permanent teeth from an area with a fluoride-deficient (0,3% mg/I) water supply' document also shows that the F-content decreases quickly at depths greater than 10 microns from the surface layer. This is consistent with the idea that deciduous teeth do not show fluorosis.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
