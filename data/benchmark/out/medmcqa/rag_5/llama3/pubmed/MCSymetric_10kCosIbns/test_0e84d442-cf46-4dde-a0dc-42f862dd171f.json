["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the effects of nitrates on angina relief during treadmill exercise. In unstable angina pectoris, the major factors appear to be intracoronary platelet aggregation and thrombus formation secondary to fissuring or rupture of atheromatous plaques. Nitrates are used in the vast majority of patients with unstable angina. The documents also discuss the role of nitrates in post-infarct phase, where studies have shown that there is a better prognosis especially when left ventricular over dilatation can be prevented by consistent nitrate therapy. Finally, the documents describe the mechanism of action of nitrates in acute attack of angina. Based on these discussions, it appears that the major mechanism of action of nitrates in acute attack of angina is coronary vasodilation.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
