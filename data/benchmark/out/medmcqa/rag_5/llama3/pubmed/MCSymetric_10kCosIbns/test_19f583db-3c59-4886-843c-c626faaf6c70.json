["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking to test the statistical significance of difference in height between a group of 20 boys aged 10 years and 20 girls of same age. Since we are comparing means of two groups with different standard deviations, we can't use X2 or F tests. We need to find the most appropriate test for this situation. The data seems to be normally distributed (as there is no mention of non-normality) and since we have paired samples (boys and girls of same age), it's more likely that the variance is equal between groups, so we can use an independent two-sample t-test.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
