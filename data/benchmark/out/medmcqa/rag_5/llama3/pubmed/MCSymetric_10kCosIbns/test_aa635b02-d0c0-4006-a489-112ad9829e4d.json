["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about secondary flare, which is a symptom of metal fume fever. Metal fume fever is caused by inhalation of metal particles, which can cause an inflammatory response and lead to symptoms such as fever, chills, and cough. The temperature increase in metal fume fever is non-specific, meaning it's not specific to one particular disease or condition. Fever curves are also discussed in the context of Fever of unknown origin (febris continua e causa ignota). According to this document, the normal diurnal variation in temperature can often be recognized in infectious diseases but not always in non-infectious conditions. The fever curve is described as a higher set-point of the normal temperature regulation which is controlled by the center in the anterior part of hypothalamus. IL-1 is believed to act through an induction of a prostaglandin E cascade. Since metal fume fever is caused by inhalation of metal particles, it's likely that the secondary flare is related to this condition.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
