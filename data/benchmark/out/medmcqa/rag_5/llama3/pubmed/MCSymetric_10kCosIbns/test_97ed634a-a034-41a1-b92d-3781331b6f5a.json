["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the sinus that grows till early adulthood. We can start by looking at the documents provided. The first document talks about supernumerary nostrils, but it doesn't mention anything about a specific type of sinus growing till early adulthood. The second document discusses mucous glands in the developing human nose, but it's not related to the growth of sinuses. The third document is about cranial dermal sinuses, which are different from the type of sinus we're looking for. The fourth document discusses the embryonic development of the lateral nasal wall, and it mentions the maxillary sinus. According to this document, the cartilaginous nasal capsule regresses and the expanding bone forms the lateral wall of the inferior meatus by 13-14 weeks. This suggests that the maxillary sinus grows till early adulthood.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
