["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the prevention of transmission of HIV from mother to child. The options provided are Oral zidovudine to mother at 3rd trimester along with oral zidovudine to infant for 6 weeks, Vitamin A prophylaxis to mother, Vaginal delivery, and Stopping breast feed. Upon reviewing the relevant documents, it is established that perinatal transmission of HIV occurs through vertical or perinatal transmission, i.e., from the mother to the fetus and neonates. The risk factors for mother-to-child transmission of HIV-1 infection include maternal p24-antigenaemia and a CD4 count of less than 700/microliters. Breastfeeding is also associated with an increased risk of transmission. Vaginal delivery does not appear to be a significant risk factor, as caesarean deliveries may have a protective effect.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
