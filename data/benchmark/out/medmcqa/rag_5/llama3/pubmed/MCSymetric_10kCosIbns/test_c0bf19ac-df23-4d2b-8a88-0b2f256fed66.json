["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the formation of granulation tissue and the types of collagen involved. Since the bleeding has been stopped due to granulation tissue formation, we are looking at a mature granulation tissue. In the document 'Collagen in granulation tissues', it is mentioned that newly formed collagen in granulation tissues is characterized by an abnormally low solubility and an easy degradation by collagenases and collagenolytic cathepsins. This suggests that the collagen type involved is likely Type III, which is also mentioned in the document 'Studies of the structure of alpha-chains revealed that type III collagen (embryonic collagen) is present in granulation tissues.'.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
