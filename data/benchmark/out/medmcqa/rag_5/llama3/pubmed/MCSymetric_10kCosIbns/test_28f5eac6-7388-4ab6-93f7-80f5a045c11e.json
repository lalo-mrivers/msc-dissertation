["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents provided are related to heroin addiction. The first document discusses the relationship between plasma levels of testosterone, dihydrotestosterone, androstenedione, LH, FSH, and the plasma concentration of heroin in subjects addicted to narcotics. Since the question asks what heroin contains, I will focus on the chemical composition of heroin. According to the documents, heroin is a narcotic drug. Therefore, I can eliminate options C, D as they are not related to heroin. Option A is also incorrect as it refers to androstenedione and testosterone, which are hormones studied in the first document but not part of heroin's chemical composition. The correct answer would be B: Acetyl morphine, which is a compound derived from morphine and is an active ingredient in heroin.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
