["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To calculate the neonatal mortality rate, we need to first determine the number of live births. This is given as 12,450. Next, we need to subtract the number of stillbirths from this total, which gives us 12,238 (12,450 - 212). The number of neonatal deaths is 450. Finally, we can calculate the mortality rate by dividing the number of neonatal deaths by the number of live births and multiplying by 1,000.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
