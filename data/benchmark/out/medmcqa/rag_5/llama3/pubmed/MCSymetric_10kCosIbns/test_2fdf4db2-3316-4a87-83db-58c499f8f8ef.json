["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking to define what a problem village is in the National Water Supply and Sanitation programme. The relevant documents are about water supply and sanitation issues in different regions. After reviewing the documents, I found that none of the options (A, B, C, D) directly relate to defining a problem village in the context of the National Water Supply and Sanitation programme. Therefore, I need to analyze the question more closely. A problem village is likely defined as a village that lacks access to safe water or sanitation services. Based on this understanding, I can eliminate options B, C, and D as they are not related to defining a problem village. Option A, which states 'Distance of safe water is greater than 1.6 km', seems more relevant to the definition of a problem village.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
