["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about periradicular surgery, which is a procedure related to the management of mandibular fractures and sequelae. None of the provided documents are directly related to this type of procedure. However, the documents do provide information on bone grafting and reconstruction. In the [Review of bone grafting for reconstruction of discontinuity defects of the mandible] document, it is mentioned that autogenous ilium and rib were used in 35 patients. This suggests that instruments like osteotomes or chisels might be used to remove bone during periradicular surgery, but this information is not explicitly stated. The other documents discuss various techniques for reconstruction and grafting, but do not provide information on the specific instrumentation used during these procedures.\n\nThe question seems to be asking about the type of burr used to remove bone during periradicular surgery. Since none of the provided documents directly address this topic, we must rely on general dental or surgical practices. In general, surgeons use osteotomes or chisels for removing bone, rather than burs.\n\nThere is no mention in the provided documents about the specific burrs used (round burr, double inverted cone burr, fissure burr, or taper burr) during periradicular surgery.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
