["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the poison that produces a bluish discoloration of the stomach during postmortem examination. After reviewing the relevant documents, I notice that one of them discusses methemoglobin-poisoning, which accelerates the reduction of ferrihemoglobin when toluidine-blue is applied intravenously. This suggests that there might be an association with a bluish discoloration. Upon further review, I find that another document mentions organophosphates as being treated with high doses of atropine and obidoxime (Toxogonin). Organophosphates can cause methemoglobinemia, which is characterized by the production of methemoglobin in the blood, resulting in a bluish discoloration. Therefore, I suspect that consumption of organophosphate poison might produce this type of discoloration.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
