["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the case of a 10-year-old child with an ANB angle of -4° and a facial angle of 98°. The ANB angle is typically measured in cephalograms to assess the relationship between the maxilla (upper jaw) and the mandible (lower jaw). A negative value for the ANB angle indicates that the maxilla is retruded (backward) relative to the mandible, which is consistent with a Class III malocclusion. The facial angle of 98° also suggests a Class III malocclusion, as it is within the normal range for this age group.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
