["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about what causes the gingiva to protrude out of the margins when a rubber dam is applied. The relevant documents describe gingival recession and root covering, as well as mucogingival surgery which focuses on preserving attached gingiva. Considering these points, we can rule out options B and C as they are not related to gingival recession or soft tissue plastic surgery. Option A refers to edematous gingival tissues, but it is not the most likely cause of protruding gingiva when a rubber dam is applied. Therefore, option D, which states that 'holes placed too close together' can cause the gingiva to protrude out of the margins, seems the most plausible explanation.\", \"answer_choice\": D}"]
