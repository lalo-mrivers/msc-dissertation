["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the posterior limit of a maxillary denture base. The relevant documents are related to dentures and jaw geometries. None of the documents explicitly mention the terms 'Hamular notch', 'Hamular process', 'Fovea palatine' or 'Vibrating Line'. However, based on the information provided in the Comparison of an anatomic versus physiologic method of posterior tooth placement for complete dentures document, it is possible to infer that the 'posterior border' refers to the area where the mandibular posterior teeth are placed. Since this document does not specifically mention the maxilla, we need to look at another document that discusses the shape and geometry of the jaw. The [Accuracy of fit of the denture base depending on various jaw geometries. Biotechnical analysis] document mentions the 'alveolar ridge', which is defined as an angle with the vertical plane. This information can be used to infer that the posterior border might refer to the area where the alveolar ridge meets the posterior edge of the maxilla. Based on this inference, we can deduce that the correct answer is the D: Vibrating Line.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
