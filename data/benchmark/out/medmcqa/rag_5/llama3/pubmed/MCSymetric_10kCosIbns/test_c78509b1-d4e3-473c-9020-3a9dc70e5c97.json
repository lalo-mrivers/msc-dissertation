["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents discuss the major risk factors for coronary heart disease (CHD), including diet. The George Lyman Duff Memorial Lecture emphasizes the role of nutrition in reducing CHD risk, and recommends reducing or eliminating certain risk factors such as a diet high in cholesterol and saturated fats. Dietary recommendations to the community suggest reducing intake of foods high in saturated fats and replacing them with foods high in polyunsaturated fats, which will lower total fat and dietary cholesterol intakes. The Relation between diet composition and coronary heart disease risk factors study found that diets were high in protein and fat and low in carbohydrates, and that a positive association was found between some nutrient components and blood lipids.\n\nDietary recommendations for the community towards the postponement of coronary heart disease suggest reducing intake of foods that are high in saturated fats and replacing them with foods that are relatively high in polyunsaturated fats. This will lower both total fat and dietary cholesterol intakes and change the ratio of polyunsaturated to saturated fats. Optimal nutrition recommends modification of the usual American diet, which is not optimal, to prevent chronic diseases.\n\nThe document Diet and coronary heart disease suggests that habitual pattern of diet undoubtedly is strongly involved in the causation of CHD and that for the primary and secondary dietary prevention of CHD, intake of fat (also cholesterol) should be reduced, with an increase in the polyunsaturated moiety, and obesity should be controlled.\n\nBased on these recommendations, it appears that reducing saturated fats and increasing polyunsaturated fats is a key dietary goal for avoiding coronary artery disease. This is supported by the study Relation between diet composition and coronary heart disease risk factors which found that diets high in protein and fat and low in carbohydrates had a positive association with blood lipids.\n\nThe document Diet and coronary heart disease also recommends reducing intake of fat (also cholesterol) and increasing polyunsaturated moiety, as well as controlling obesity. The George Lyman Duff Memorial Lecture emphasizes the importance of nutrition in reducing CHD risk and recommends modifying the diet to reduce or eliminate certain risk factors.\n\nTherefore, it appears that the dietary goals for avoiding coronary artery disease include reducing saturated fat intake and increasing polyunsaturated fat intake, which is supported by multiple documents.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
