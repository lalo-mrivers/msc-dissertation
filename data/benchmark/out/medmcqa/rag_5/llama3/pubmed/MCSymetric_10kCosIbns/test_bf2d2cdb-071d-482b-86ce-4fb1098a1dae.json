["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the functional classification of muscles that determine mandibular movements, biologic laws governing functions of muscles that move the mandible, posterior guidance of the mandible as a neuromuscular assigned dimeric joint chain, biomechanical model of the human mandible involving stabilizing activity of the superior belly of lateral pterygoid muscle, and the human mandible functioning simultaneously as both lever and link during incisal biting. Among these documents, we can find information about the muscles that move the mandible. The digastric muscle is not mentioned in any of these documents as an elevator of the mandible. Therefore, it can be inferred that the digastric muscle is NOT an elevator of the mandible.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
