["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with chronic sinusitis, nasopharyngeal ulcers, cavitatory lung nodules, and renal failure. These symptoms suggest an underlying inflammatory disease or infection. The presence of cavitatory lung nodules and renal failure suggests a systemic process that requires further evaluation.
