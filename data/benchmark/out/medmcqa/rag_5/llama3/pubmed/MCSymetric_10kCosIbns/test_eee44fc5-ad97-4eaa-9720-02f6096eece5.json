["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the timing of extraction of impacted 3rd molar when the patient is planned for bilateral sagittal split osteotomy. The documents suggest that there are no absolute indications or contra-indications for removal of asymptomatic 3rd molar teeth, and the decision should be made based on rational clinical decision-making. The literature also emphasizes the importance of considering all possible outcomes of third molar extraction.\n\nFrom the document 'The case of the disappearing third molar', we can learn that a patient's discomfort led to incisional biopsy and marsupialization, which resulted in adequate bone regeneration eight months later. This suggests that there may be risks associated with early removal of impacted 3rd molars.\n\nIn contrast, the document 'Risks and benefits of removal of impacted third molars' suggests that there are no well-defined criteria for removal of impacted 3rd molar teeth, and absolute indications or contra-indications cannot be established. This implies that the decision to remove an impacted 3rd molar should be based on individual patient factors rather than a standardized timeline.\n\nBased on these considerations, it seems that the timing of extraction would depend on the specific patient's needs and circumstances.\n\n\", \"answer_choice\": C}"]
