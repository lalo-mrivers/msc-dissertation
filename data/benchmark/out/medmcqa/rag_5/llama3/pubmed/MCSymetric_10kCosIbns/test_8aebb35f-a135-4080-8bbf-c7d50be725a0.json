["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, we know that penicillinase (beta-lactamase) is an enzyme that inactivates penicillin. The documents also mention that beta-lactamase inhibitors were developed to counter the ability of staphylococci to produce this enzyme. This suggests that some penicillins may be resistant to degradation by beta-lactamase, and are therefore considered 'penicillinase-resistant'. Among the provided options, cloxacillin is mentioned as an oxacillin derivative in the document 'Penicillin-resistant pneumococci', which suggests that it may have a similar mechanism of action. Therefore, we can infer that cloxacillin is likely to be penicillinase-resistant.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
