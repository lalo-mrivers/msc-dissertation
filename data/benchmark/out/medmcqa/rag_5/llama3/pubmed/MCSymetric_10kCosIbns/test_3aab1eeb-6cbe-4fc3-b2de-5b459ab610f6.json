["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about acceptable investigations at day 3 of presentation for a suspected patient of dengue. The first thing to note is that the relevant documents provide information on liver biochemical tests and dengue fever, as well as some case studies on dengue haemorrhagic fever. However, none of these documents mention NS I antigen detection or any other specific test beyond laboratory analysis for viral infection. Therefore, we can rule out C: NS I antigen detection as an acceptable investigation at day 3 of presentation. The remaining options are A: Viral culture and isolation in C6/36 cell line, B: ELISA for antibody against dengue virus, and D: #NAME?, which is not a valid option.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
