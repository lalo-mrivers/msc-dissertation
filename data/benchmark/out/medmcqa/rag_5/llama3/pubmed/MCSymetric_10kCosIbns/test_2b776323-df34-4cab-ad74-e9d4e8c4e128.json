["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"There is no direct mention of the distance of the blade from the shank for antirotational stability. However, considering the context of biomechanical investigations and osteosynthesis, we can infer that a larger distance would provide more stability. The documents describe various plate systems with different angles and thicknesses, but do not specify the exact distance required for antirotational stability.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
