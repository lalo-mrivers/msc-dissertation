["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about cleaning base metal alloys. The documents provided do not mention the specific composition of the base metal alloys. However, we can look at the studies on high temperature oxidation of noble metal alloys and ceramic bonding with non-noble metals. These studies suggest that some alloying elements like Zn, Al, Si, Be, and Mg have a high affinity for oxygen and their oxides have high electrical resistivity. This implies that cleaning processes using acid solutions may be effective in removing surface impurities. Sand blasting is also possible as it was mentioned in the study on Rocatec system.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
