["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks which anti-cholinergic drug doesn't cross the blood brain barrier and placenta. From the provided documents, it is mentioned that atropine antagonized pilocarpine- or oxotremorine-induced decrease in locomotor activity and increase of the reaction time to pain in mice, while methylatropinium did not. This suggests that methylatropinium does not cross the blood brain barrier and placenta. The same document also mentions that atropine and methylatropinium suppressed the antagonism of cholinergics towards reserpine-induced palpebral ptosis, suggesting that atropine crosses the blood brain barrier.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
