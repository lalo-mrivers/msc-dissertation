["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks which bones are involved in wrist joint formation. According to the provided documents, we have information about the carpal bones (wrist anatomy) and the ligaments of the human wrist and their functional significance. The normal axial relationship of the wrist mentions the 360 wrists measured. However, none of these texts explicitly mention the involvement of specific bones like Ulna or Triquetral in wrist joint formation. On the other hand, we know that the multiple joints within the wrist are formed by a complex structure capable of transmitting significant loads to the upper extremity (wrist anatomy). This implies that the bones directly involved in this process would be Scaphoid, Radius, and possibly others like Triquetrum.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
