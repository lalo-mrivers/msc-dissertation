["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The article discusses the properties of sodium channel inactivation. When sodium channel inactivation is prolonged, it suggests that the time constant of recovery from inactivation (tau(c)) increases. This means that it takes longer for the sodium channels to recover and become available again. In the context of nerve conduction, this would result in a decreased conduction velocity.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
