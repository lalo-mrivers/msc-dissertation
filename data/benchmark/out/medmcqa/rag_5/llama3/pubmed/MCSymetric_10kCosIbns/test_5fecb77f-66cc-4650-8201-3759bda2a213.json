["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To find the steady-state plasma concentration of drug X, we need to calculate its clearance (CL) in mL/min. Given that CL is 640 mL/min, and the infusion rate (K0) is 1.6 mg/min, we can convert K0 from mg/min to mL/min by dividing it by the molecular weight of the drug X. Since the molecular weight is not provided, let's assume it's approximately equal to the molecular weight of a typical small molecule (around 300 g/mol). This gives us K0 = 1.6 mg/min / 300 g/mol ≈ 5.33 mL/min.\n\nNow, we can use the formula for steady-state plasma concentration (Css) as described in 'Pharmacokinetics in clinical practice. I. Concepts.' :\n\nCss = Dose / CL\n\nwhere Dose is the infusion rate K0. Substituting the values, we get:\n\nCss ≈ 1.6 mg/min / 640 mL/min ≈ 2.5 μg/mL (approximately)\n\nConverting this to mg/mL, we get:\n\nCss ≈ 2.5 μg/mL × 1000 μg/mg × 10^(-3) g/μg × 10^6 μL/mL ≈ 0.0025 mg/mL\n\nFinally, rounding this value to three significant figures gives us the answer.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
