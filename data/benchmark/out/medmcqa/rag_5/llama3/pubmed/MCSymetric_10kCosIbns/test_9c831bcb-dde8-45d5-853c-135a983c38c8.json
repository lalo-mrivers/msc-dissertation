["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, we are given the mean and standard deviation of diastolic blood pressure (DBP) as 110 mm Hg with a SD of 11 mm Hg. This represents the variance of DBP. Then, we are given the mean and standard deviation of vitamin D (VitD) as 18 ng/ml with a SD of 3 ng/ml. To determine the relation between the two variances, we need to compare the variance of DBP with the variance of VitD.\n\nThe variance of DBP is given by: Variance = (SD)^2 = (11 mm Hg)^2 = 121 mm Hg^2\n\nThe mean and standard deviation of VitD are given as 18 ng/ml and 3 ng/ml, respectively. The variance of VitD is calculated as follows:\n\nVariance = (SD)^2 = (3 ng/ml)^2 = 9 ng/ml^2\n\nNow, we can compare the variances: Variance of DBP > Variance of VitD. Therefore, option B 'Variance of DBP > 4 times Vitamin D' is correct.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
