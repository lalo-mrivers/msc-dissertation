None of the provided documents directly address this topic. However, I can analyze the information provided and identify diseases that are known to have chronic carrier states.\n\nMeasles, diptheria, typhoid, and gonorrhea are all infectious diseases that can be spread through contact with an infected person or contaminated surfaces.
