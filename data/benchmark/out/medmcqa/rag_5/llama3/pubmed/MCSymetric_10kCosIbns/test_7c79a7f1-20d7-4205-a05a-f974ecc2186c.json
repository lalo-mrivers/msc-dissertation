["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the centric holding cusp. According to the provided documents, specifically Part II of 'Application of 'cusp writer' findings to practical and theoretical occlusal problems', the optimal height and angulation of the cusps are determined by the angle of the plane (curve) of occlusion to the plane of motion in concert with other occlusal influences. The steepness of the curve of Spee determines the relative cusp height and angulation of one tooth to another, from an anterior to a posterior direction in the dental arch.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
