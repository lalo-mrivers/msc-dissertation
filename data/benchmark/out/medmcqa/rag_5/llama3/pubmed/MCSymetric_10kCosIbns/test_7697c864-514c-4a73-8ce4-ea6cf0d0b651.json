["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about sequential arrangement of fetal scans. The documents provided discuss various types of fetal scanning including smaller parts scanning, two-dimensional echocardiography, ultrasonic imaging of normal intrauterine fetal anatomy, new and future techniques in prenatal diagnosis, and diagnostic radiology of fetal abnormalities. These scans are used for various purposes such as detection of anomalies, prediction of pathology, detection of abnormalities, and confirming normality. The documents do not mention 'growth scan' or 'triple marker', but they do discuss other types of scans including anomalous scan. Since the question is asking about sequential arrangement of fetal scans, we need to look for information that mentions multiple scans being performed sequentially.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
