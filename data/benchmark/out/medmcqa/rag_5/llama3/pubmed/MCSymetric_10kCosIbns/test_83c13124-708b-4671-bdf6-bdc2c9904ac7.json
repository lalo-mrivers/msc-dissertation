["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about prions. Prions are infectious proteins that cause diseases such as Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease and Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE or mad cow disease). They do not contain DNA/RNA, so option D can be ruled out. Prions are resistant to heat, radiation, and chemicals that can easily inactivate other infectious agents, such as viruses and bacteria. Autoclaving at 121oC is a common method used to sterilize medical instruments, but it does not effectively kill prions. Therefore, option A is incorrect. Prions do not evoke a strong immunogenic reaction like antigens would, so option B can be ruled out. The incubation period of prion diseases is typically long, ranging from years to decades, which makes option C incorrect.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
