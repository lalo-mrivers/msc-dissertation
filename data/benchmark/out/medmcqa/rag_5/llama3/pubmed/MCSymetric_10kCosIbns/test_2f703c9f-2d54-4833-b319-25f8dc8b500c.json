["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the type of laser used in Waterlase system. I will review the relevant documents to find the answer. The document 'Preliminary evaluation of a new high power diode laser' mentions the development of a high-powered semiconductor diode laser (805 nm) for medical use, which has potential advantages over existing Nd:YAG lasers. This information suggests that Diode Laser might be used in Waterlase system. Additionally, another document 'Laser applications in medicine and surgery' briefly discusses the different types of lasers used in various medical applications, including endoscopy. No specific mention is made about Waterlase system, but this document does not contradict the possibility of using a Diode Laser in such a system.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
