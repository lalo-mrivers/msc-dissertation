["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The document describes the characteristics of alpha thalassemia in American Blacks. The study found that the proportion of HbH is lower and the severity of anaemia is less than in certain other racial groups, e.g. Southeast Asians. However, the degree of hypochromia and microcytosis and the imbalance in alpha and beta globin synthesis appear to be similar in Blacks and other races. These results suggest that the milder clinical course of HbH disease in Blacks is not a result of greater alpha globin production in that population of thalassaemics.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
