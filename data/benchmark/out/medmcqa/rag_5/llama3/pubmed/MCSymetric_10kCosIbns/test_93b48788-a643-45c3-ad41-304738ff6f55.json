["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for the best indicator of developing cardiovascular disease. From the provided documents, we can see that risk factors such as hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and glucose intolerance are mentioned as being evaluated in the Cardiovascular Health Study. Additionally, the study found a positive correlation between mean level of blood pressure, total cholesterol in serum, and prevalence rate of cardiovascular disease. This suggests that these risk factors may be indicators of developing cardiovascular disease.\n\nThe Evans County Cardiovascular study also found considerable agreement between estimates of risk derived from incidence and prevalence data using four risk factors: sex, blood pressure, age, and serum cholesterol. This suggests that these risk factors may also be useful in predicting the development of cardiovascular disease.\n\nHowever, none of the provided documents specifically mention LDL cholesterol level more than 120 mg/dl as a risk factor for developing cardiovascular disease. Additionally, there is no information about salt intake being a risk factor for cardiovascular disease.\n\nThe only option that seems to be supported by the provided documents is the LDL/HDL ratio, which was found to have a negative correlation with the incidence rate of sudden death from CHD.\n\nTherefore, based on the available data, the best indicator of developing cardiovascular disease appears to be the LDL/HDL ratio.\", \"answer_choice\": C}"]
