["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To calculate the net filtration pressure, we need to find the difference between PGC (pre-glomerular capillary) and pGC (post-glomerular capillary) pressures. PBC (peritubular capillary) pressure is not directly involved in this calculation. Since no proteins were filtered, the pressure drop across the membrane is purely due to convective flow of fluid through the pore spaces. Hence, we subtract pGC from PGC to get net filtration pressure. The formula would be: Net Filtration Pressure = PGC - pGC. Now, plugging in the given values, we get: NFP = 42 mm Hg - 12 mm Hg = 30 mm Hg.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
