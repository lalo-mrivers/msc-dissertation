["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the given documents, I know that free way space refers to the gap between teeth and denture. The document [Shape of the denture base and self-cleaning] talks about the relationship between this gap and plaque formation. This suggests that a smaller free way space might lead to increased plaque accumulation. According to [Theoretical physical thoughts on the masticatory stability of complete dentures], a more stable occlusal alignment is crucial for masticatory stability. This implies that a reduced free way space could also affect the stability and retention of the denture, which in turn can cause alveolar ridge resorption. Therefore, I conclude that a free way space of less than normal has an adverse result of irresistible alveolar ridge resorption.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
