["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant document that discusses the composition of high-copper amalgams is 'A study of high copper amalgams. II. Amalgamation on a Hg-plated high copper alloy containing 30 wt% Cu.' According to this document, both gamma1 Ag-Hg and micro Cu-Sn crystals form on the tablets. The document also mentions that in another study (Part I), T tablets were studied and reported. This information is not relevant to the question about epsilon in high-copper amalgams.\n\nAnother relevant document is 'The influence of final mercury content on the characteristics of a high-copper amalgam.' According to this document, as the Hg content is increased, a point is reached beyond which creep and the amount of Sn in gamma1 exhibit a sudden increase. This suggests that the composition of the amalgam changes with increasing Hg content.\n\nFinally, we have 'The influence of final mercury content on the characteristics of a high-copper amalgam.' According to this document, as the Hg content is increased further, gamma2 can be detected. These phenomena can be explained by the hypothesis that insufficient Cu is present at higher Hg contents to combine with Sn to form Cu6Sn5.\n\nBased on these documents, we know that Cu6Sn5 is a compound that forms in high-copper amalgams when there is sufficient Cu to combine with Sn. Therefore, epsilon in high copper amalgam must be Cu6Sn5.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
