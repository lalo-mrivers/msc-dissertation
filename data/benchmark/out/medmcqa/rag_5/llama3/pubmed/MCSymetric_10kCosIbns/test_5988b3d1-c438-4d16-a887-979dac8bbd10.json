["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the shortest root of maxillary 1st molar. We can look at the relevant documents to find the answer. In the document 'Morphologic study of the maxillary molars', it states that the lingual roots curving toward the buccal on 54.6% and 52.3% of the first and second molars respectively. This suggests that the shortest root is likely the palatal root, as the palatal root is typically shorter than the other two roots. This information can be confirmed by looking at the document 'Anatomical study of the root apex in the maxillary anterior teeth', which states that the labiolingual diameter of the root canal at the apical constriction of the central incisors, lateral incisors, and cuspids averaged 0.425 mm, 0.369 mm, and 0.375 mm, respectively; and the respective vertical distances between apex and apical constriction were 0.863 mm, 0.825 mm, and 1.010 mm.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
