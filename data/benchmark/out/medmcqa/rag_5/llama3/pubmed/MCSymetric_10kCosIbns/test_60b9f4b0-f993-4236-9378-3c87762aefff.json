["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to the documents provided, metformin-induced lactic acidosis is a rare but life-threatening side effect that occurs mainly in patients with serious renal insufficiency or other contraindications. The reported cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis show common underlying conditions such as renal, cardiovascular, and liver disease. Therefore, it can be inferred that factors increasing the risk of lactic acidosis are those that compromise renal function or exist as pre-existing conditions.\n\nThe question asks which factor increases the risk of lactic acidosis except. Smoking is not mentioned as a risk factor in any of the provided documents, so option B: Smoking is the most likely correct answer.\n\nLiver dysfunction is actually mentioned as a risk factor for metformin-induced lactic acidosis (Document 3), so it is an incorrect choice.\n\nRenal failure and advanced age are both mentioned as underlying conditions in patients who developed metformin-induced lactic acidosis. Therefore, options D: Renal failure and A: Advanced age can also be excluded as correct answers.\n\nThe most likely correct answer is B: Smoking.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
