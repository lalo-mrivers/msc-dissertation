["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to the documents, it is emphasized that thrombolysis can be accomplished safely in acute ischemic stroke if administered early, specifically within six hours of symptom onset. Additionally, studies performed in animal models of stroke revealed that thrombolysis could be done safely and effectively if treated within a few hours or less after symptom onset.

However, based on available data, it appears that early treatment (within 6 hours) is crucial for successful outcomes.\", \"answer_choice\": C}"]
