["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the most effective caries prevention program in children. Based on the provided documents, it seems that the Seminar for Youth Dental Health (1961) recommends a combination of prophylaxis measures to reduce caries incidence by 67%. The study 'Effect of intensified caries prevention on approximal caries in adolescents with high caries risk' suggests that intensified prevention did not lead to a significant difference in caries increment between the two risk groups. Additionally, the document 'Estimation of actual caries prevalence and treatment needs from field survey caries information on a child population in U.S.A.' proposes tables for estimating treatment needs based on survey mean scores. The study 'A caries preventive programme for Robertson school children--baseline data' describes the baseline caries experience of a cohort school children, but it does not provide specific recommendations for caries prevention.\n\nConsidering these documents, oral health education and pit and fissure sealants seem to be more relevant to caries prevention than enameloplasty or ART. Therefore, I will focus on these two options. Oral health education is mentioned as essential in the study 'Dental caries and the necessity of treatment in pre-school children'. Pit and fissure sealants are not explicitly mentioned in any of the provided documents, but they are a common method for caries prevention.\n\nBased on this analysis, I conclude that oral health education is a scientifically proven and cost-efficient caries prevention program in children.\", \n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
