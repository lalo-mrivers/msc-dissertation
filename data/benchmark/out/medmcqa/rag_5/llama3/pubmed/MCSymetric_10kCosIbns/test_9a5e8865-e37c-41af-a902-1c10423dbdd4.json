["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about a 10-year-old boy who has suffered a road traffic accident and presents to the casualty with a contaminated wound over his left leg. He has received his complete primary immunization before preschool age and a booster of DT at school entry age. The options for treatment are Injection of TT, Injection of human antiserum, Broad spectrum antibiotics, and Wound debridement and cleaning. Since the boy is already vaccinated against DT, there is no need to administer another dose of TT. Human antiserum is not relevant to this situation. Broad spectrum antibiotics may be necessary to prevent infection. Debridement and cleaning of the wound are also essential for proper treatment. Therefore, the only option that cannot be done is Injection of TT.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
