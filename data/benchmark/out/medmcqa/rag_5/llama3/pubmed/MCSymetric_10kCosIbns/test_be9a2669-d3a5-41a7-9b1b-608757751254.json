["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"After analyzing the provided documents, it is clear that red blood cells (RBCs) can be stored at room temperature without significant adverse effects on viability or function. Additionally, there are no specific instructions in the documents for RBC storage temperatures, so I will focus on general storage recommendations from different sources. One document discusses the stability of pO2, pCO2 and pH in heparinized whole blood samples, which involves storing blood at 4 degrees C or 22 degrees C. Another document suggests that biological products can be stored at -20 degrees C during freezing temperatures. Considering these factors, I will select an answer that is within a reasonable temperature range for RBC storage.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B: 2-6 degC\"\n}"]
