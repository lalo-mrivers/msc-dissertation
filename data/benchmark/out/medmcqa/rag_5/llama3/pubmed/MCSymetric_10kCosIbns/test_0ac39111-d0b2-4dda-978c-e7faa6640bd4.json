["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the age range used to determine child mortality rate. We can look at the provided documents for clues. The first document, 'Child health revisited', does not mention the specific age range used. However, the second document, 'Mortality in nineteenth century America: estimates from New York and Pennsylvania census data, 1865 and 1900', mentions that child mortality is estimated using techniques such as the Brass method, which uses the age structure of surviving children. This suggests that child mortality rates may be calculated for a specific age range, but it's not clear what that range is.\n\nThe third document, 'Levels, trends, differentials and causes of child mortality-a survey', mentions childhood mortality for ages one to under five years, which suggests that this age range is commonly used. The fourth document, '[Morbidity in children up to 1 year of age and factors affecting it during a longitudinal prospective study]', also focuses on the first year of life.\n\nConsidering these clues, we can infer that the age range used for child mortality rate determination is likely between 0-5 years or possibly 0-4 years, but we cannot determine the exact age range from the provided documents. However, option D: 0-1 years seems the most plausible choice given the focus on infant morbidity and mortality in some of the documents.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
