["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the provided documents, we can infer that the internal carotid artery has a segment within the cavernous sinus which is referred to as the intracavernous section. This section gives rise to fine ramifications that supply the surrounding structures. The origin and ramifications of this section are described in detail in the document [The origin and ramifications of the intracavernous section of the internal carotid artery]. There is no mention of any branches arising from the external carotid artery that supply the cavernous sinus or its contents.
