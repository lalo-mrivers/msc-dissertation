["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 49-year-old male with a painless mass in the left scrotal sac and microscopic hematuria. The laboratory investigation revealed negative Alpha-fetoprotein and lactate dehydrogenase. Based on this information, we can rule out non-seminomatous germ-cell testicular tumor as it would have elevated Alpha-fetoprotein levels. We also need to consider the patient's history of smoking (35 pack years) which increases the risk of lung cancer. The presence of microscopic hematuria suggests that the mass could be related to the urinary tract. Considering these points, the most probable diagnosis is a mass in the scrotum that is not directly related to testicular cancer.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
