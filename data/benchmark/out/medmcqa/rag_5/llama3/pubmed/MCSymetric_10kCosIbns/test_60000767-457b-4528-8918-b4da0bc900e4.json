["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the study of high copper amalgams I. A comparison of amalgamation on high copper alloy tablets, we know that gamma1 Ag-Hg crystals form on both types of tablet, and on one type, zeta Cu-Sn crystals are also formed. This suggests that these alloys have a certain level of creep, which is further supported by The influence of final mercury content on the characteristics of a high-copper amalgam, where it is mentioned that as the Hg content increases, a point is reached beyond which creep and the amount of Sn in gamma1 exhibit a sudden increase. Finally, Zinc-containing high copper amalgams: a 3-year clinical evaluation mentions that small amounts of zinc play a beneficial role in the serviceability of high copper amalgams, including reducing marginal breakdown.\", \"answer_choice\": D}"]
