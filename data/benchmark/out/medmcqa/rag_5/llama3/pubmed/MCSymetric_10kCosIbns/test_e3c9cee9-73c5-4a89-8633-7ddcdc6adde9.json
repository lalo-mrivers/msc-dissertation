["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks which of the given options is not a provisional entity as per WHO 2016 classification of Acute leukemia. Upon reviewing the provided documents, I see that they discuss various classifications and subtypes of acute leukemia, including the FAB system, immunological phenotypes, and chromosomal changes. There is no mention of AML with hyperploidy or B-ALL with BCR-Abl like mutation in these documents. However, Cytological classification of adult acute leukemia mentions myelodysplastic syndromes, which may mimic acute leukemia. Additionally, Acute undifferentiated leukemia with CD7+ and CD13+ immunophenotype discusses a specific subtype of acute leukemia. Finally, Phenotypic and genotypic analysis of acute leukemia--current status of lineage specific classification mentions the definition of B-lineage and T-lineage cells. Based on this information, I conclude that the correct answer is AML with hyperploidy.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
