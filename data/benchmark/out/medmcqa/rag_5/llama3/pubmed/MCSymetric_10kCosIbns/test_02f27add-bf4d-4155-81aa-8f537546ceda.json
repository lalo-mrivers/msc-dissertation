["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, we can see that there is no specific information about cleaning blood on OT floor. However, we have information about the cleanliness of floors and surfaces in hospital environments. The 'The effect of carpet on the number of microbes in the hospital environment' document suggests that there was a decrease in bacteria at the ends of each corridor after 3.6m of carpet had been installed at the entrance, indicating that flooring can affect microbial growth. Additionally, the 'Microbiological study of surfaces in the hospital environment' document discusses the use of disinfectants and sampling techniques for floors. Considering this information, we can infer that the cleaning method used to clean blood on OT floor might be related to disinfectants or antiseptics, but there is no direct mention of it. Therefore, I will base my answer on the available information.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
