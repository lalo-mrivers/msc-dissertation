["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about lymph drainage from the tongue. After reviewing the documents, I see that there is no direct mention of lymphatic pathways or lymph drainage specific to the tongue. However, I notice that [Cancer of the tongue. Anatomopathological and clinical considerations] mentions 'lymphatic pathways' in the context of cancer of the tongue. This suggests that the lymphatic system may be involved in draining the tongue, but it doesn't provide specific information on which vessels are responsible for this drainage. Given the anatomical features described in [The natural progress of atherosclerosis of the tongue (author's transl)], I infer that the lateral undersurface of the tongue has a rich vascular network. However, this does not directly address lymph drainage from the tongue.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
