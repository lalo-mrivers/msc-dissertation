["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the cause of lateral movement of condyle. The documents provided mention that 3-D CT is most accurate in detecting inferior condylar movements, but does not provide information on lateral and posterior movements. However, one of the documents mentions cineradiographic evaluation of the temporomandibular joint movements which showed that the condyle path is characterized by neuromuscular coordination. This suggests that the movement of the condyle is influenced by the muscles surrounding it. The choices provided are all related to pterygoid muscles, which are involved in jaw movement.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
