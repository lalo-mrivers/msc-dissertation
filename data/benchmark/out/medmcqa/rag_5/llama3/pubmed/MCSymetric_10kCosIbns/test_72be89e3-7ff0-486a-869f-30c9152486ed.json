["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the typical outcome of a root fracture in the apical one-third of permanent anterior teeth. The relevant documents describe various types of root fractures, but none specifically address apical one-thirds fractures. However, we can draw some conclusions from the studies on root fractures in general. For example, pulp obliteration occurred in 86% of cases, which may indicate that the pulp is not necessarily vital after a root fracture. Additionally, the document on tooth fracture in vivo and in vitro mentions that fracture risk is higher in first permanent molars than other tooth types, especially in the lower jaw. This suggests that apical one-thirds fractures may also have a higher risk of pulp necrosis or other complications.\n\nConsidering these points, it seems unlikely that the teeth would remain in function and be vital (option B). Papal necrosis and ankylosis is not mentioned as a common outcome, so option C is also less likely. Extraction and prosthetic replacement may be necessary if the fracture is severe or if there are other complications, but this is not necessarily the typical outcome for apical one-thirds fractures.\n\nTherefore, based on the available information, it seems that the teeth would likely undergo pulp obliteration or necrosis, rather than remaining vital and in function. This makes option D the most plausible choice.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
