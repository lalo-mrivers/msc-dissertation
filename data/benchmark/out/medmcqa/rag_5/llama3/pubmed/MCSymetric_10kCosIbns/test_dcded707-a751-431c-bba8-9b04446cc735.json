["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the detachment of myosin head from actin. The relevant documents describe the structure and function of the myosin head, including its binding to F-actin and the effects of ATP on its shape. We see that the myosin heads can be in a straight or bent shape, and that bending occurs at 12 +/- 2 nm from the head-rod junction. The bending region locates at the boundary of domains. Bent heads increase in the presence of ADP-Vi. This suggests that the heads are in equilibrium and that ADP-Vi shifts the equilibrium to the bent shape.\n\nThe document also describes the effects of modification of head A with rho-chloromercuribenzoate (CMB) on the interaction of head B with F-actin. We see that CMB-modified myosin has increased ATPase activity and is less sensitive to substrate inhibition or calcium sensitivity.\n\nFinally, the last document discusses the effect of actin on the tryptic digestion of myosin subfragment 1 (S1) in the weakly attached state. This suggests that actin can induce localized changes in the S1 structure.\n\nBased on this information, we can conclude that the detachment of myosin head from actin is caused by the release of ADP and Pi.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
