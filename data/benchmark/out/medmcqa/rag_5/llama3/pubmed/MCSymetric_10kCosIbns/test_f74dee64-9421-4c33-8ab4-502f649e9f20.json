["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents discuss the anatomy and development of teeth, but there is no specific information on the differences between primary and secondary roots. However, we can infer some information from the text. The document 'Vascular pathways within pulpal tissue of human primary teeth' describes the architecture of the vascular structures in the pulp chamber of primary teeth. It mentions that arterioles entered the apical foramina and traveled throughout the root canal(s) to the pulpal chamber, giving off branches which passed toward the dentinal walls. Within the pulpal chamber, the arterioles passed toward the occlusal and proximal surfaces and arborized profusely to form a subodontoblastic plexus of capillaries.\n\nIn contrast, the document 'Mineral metabolism and microstructural defects in primate teeth' describes the root tissues of primary teeth as having many lateral canals. This suggests that primary roots may have more accessory and lateral canals compared to secondary roots.\n\nTherefore, based on this analysis, we can infer that the correct answer is A: Primary roots show less accessory and lateral canals.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
