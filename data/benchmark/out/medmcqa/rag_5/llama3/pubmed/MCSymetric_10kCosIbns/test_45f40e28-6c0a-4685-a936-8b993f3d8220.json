["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the tensile strength of bone, which was investigated in the document 'The effect of histological variation on the tensile strength of cortical bone'. The study measured the tensile strength of longitudinally orientated specimens of cortical bone at different rates of strain. The results showed that naturally occurring cavities in the structure constitute the most significant sites of weakness.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
