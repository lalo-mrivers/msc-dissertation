["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The most relevant information comes from the paper 'Management of antenatally diagnosed fetal ovarian cysts'. According to this paper, most ovarian cysts are functional in origin and histologically benign. It is also stated that spontaneous regression of cysts can occur after birth. In the case of asymptomatic infants with an ovarian cyst less than 4 cm in diameter, conservative management is recommended. Since the patient is in the first trimester and has a diagnosed ovarian cyst, it is likely that the cyst will continue to grow throughout the pregnancy. Therefore, surgical removal in the second trimester may be too late as the cyst may cause complications such as torsion or rupture. Removal after delivery may also not be desirable as this could lead to a longer hospital stay for the patient and potential risks associated with surgery. Termination of pregnancy is not necessary unless there are other significant fetal anomalies.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: Observation\""]
