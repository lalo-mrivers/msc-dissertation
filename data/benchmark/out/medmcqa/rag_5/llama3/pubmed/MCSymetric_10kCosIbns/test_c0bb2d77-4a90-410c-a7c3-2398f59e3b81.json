["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, I noticed that ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is a type of non-invasive breast cancer. Intraductal DCIS can be treated with conservative surgery, but high-grade necrosis suggests a higher risk of local recurrence. Additionally, mammography sensitivity for detecting DCIS was 0.74, so a follow-up mammogram might not detect any residual disease. The patient's tumor size and margin clearance suggest a good chance of complete resection, but the presence of high-grade necrosis increases the likelihood of local recurrence.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
