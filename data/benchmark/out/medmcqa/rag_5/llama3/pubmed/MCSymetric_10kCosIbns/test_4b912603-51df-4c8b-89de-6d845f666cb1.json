["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, it is clear that infants of diabetic mothers (IDM) are at a higher risk for various complications. From [Clinicopathologic study in children of a diabetic mother. Review of 16 cases], we see that IDM have a high frequency of respiratory illnesses, neonatal jaundice and hemorrhagic tendency more often in lungs and C.N.S. Additionally, there is hyperplasia of the pancreatic islands in 100% and a high tendency to visceral gigantism, specially in the liver, heart and lesser in the brain. From [Congenital malformations in infants of diabetic mothers], we see that the rate of congenital malformations in IDM is three to four times higher than in the normal population.\n\nFrom [Newborn infants of diabetic mothers], we see that IDM have a higher incidence of premature birth, jaundice and congenital malformations compared to infants born to mothers with gestational diabetes mellitus. Additionally, IDM have a higher rate of fetal distress, hypoglycemia, respiratory distress syndrome and birth trauma.\n\nFrom [Neonatal morbidity among infants of diabetic mothers], we see that major congenital malformations emerge not only as the leading cause of perinatal losses but also as an important cause of morbidity. Delivery before 37 weeks increased the incidence of RDS and hypocalcemia, and maternal hyperglycemia at this stage increases the incidence of neonatal hypoglycemia.\n\nFrom [Current patterns of neonatal morbidity and mortality in infants of diabetic mothers], we see that neonatal morbidity correlated significantly with gestational age, occurring in 80 per cent of the preterm and 40 per cent of the term infants. The overall incidence of complications was: hyperbilirubinemia 37 per cent, hypoglycemia 31 per cent, hypocalcemia 13 per cent, polycythemia 8 per cent, and necrotizing enterocolitis 2 per cent.\n\nTherefore, based on the above information, we can conclude that the statement 'Small baby' (option C) is true.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A: c\""]
