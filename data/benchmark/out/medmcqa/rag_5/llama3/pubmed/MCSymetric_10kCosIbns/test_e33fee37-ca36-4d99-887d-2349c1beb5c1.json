["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Comparative toxicology shows that patients having long survival times reveal drug values to approach unity when the blood and vitreous concentrations are compared. Immunology of the vitreous body states that it represents an incomplete and primitive immunological system, reacting like an embryonic tissue and exhibiting only phagocytosis. Determination of glucose in human vitreous humor shows striking differences in glucose values were obtained by various analytical procedures. Therefore, we can deduce that the question is looking for a component that has a different concentration in blood compared to vitreous humour. From [pO2, pCO2 and acid-base balance in the human vitreous sample], we know that the mean vitreous pO2 was higher than that of venous blood, suggesting that there might be a difference in certain components between blood and vitreous humour.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
