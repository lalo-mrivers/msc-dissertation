["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Since we are dealing with mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), we need to look for characteristics of MCL. According to the provided documents, MCL is characterized by the t(11;14) (q13;q32) translocation and its molecular counterpart bcl-1 rearrangement. This information suggests that MCL is not related to CD 10 or CD 23, as these are typically associated with B-cell lymphomas such as follicular lymphoma or diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Therefore, the answer should be something that includes CD 5, which is a characteristic of MCL.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: CD 5+, CD 23-\""]
