["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the relationship between blood vessel radius and blood flow. According to the document 'Velocity-diameter relationships of the microcirculation', there is a mathematical expression for the relationship between blood flow (Q) and diameter (d): Q = 108d3.101 for arteries, arterioles, and capillaries in the diameter range 5 to 900 mum. Since the question asks about an increase of 50% in radius, we can calculate the new diameter as d + (0.5 * d) = 1.5d. Then, we substitute this value into the mathematical expression to get Q = 108(1.5d)3.101. This simplifies to Q = 324d3.101.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
