["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Epstein-Barr virus is implicated in the pathogenesis of a number of human lymphoid malignancies, including immunoblastic B lymphomas, Burkitt's lymphoma, Hodgkin's disease, and certain T-cell lymphomas. According to the provided documents, Epstein-Barr virus-associated lymphomas mainly arise in immunodeficient patients by the unchecked polyclonal outgrowth of EBV-infected B-cells.
