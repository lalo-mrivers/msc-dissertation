["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe various aspects of root canal configurations in mandibular molars. One document describes C-shaped canal configurations in mandibular second molars, which were seen in 3 cases. Another document describes the position of the mandibular canal and its relation to the lingual and buccal sides of the mandible. The third document discusses root canal configuration of the mandibular first premolar, including the incidence of C-shaped canals associated with Type IV canal systems, which was seen in 14% of the roots.\n\nThe documents do not specifically describe the incidence of extra canals in mandibular first molars. However, the document on root canal configuration of mandibular second molars describes C-shaped canal configurations, and one of the documents on mandibular premolars mentions the incidence of more than one canal in mandibular premolars.\n\nBased on this information, it appears that there is no direct evidence for the incidence of extra canals in mandibular first molars. However, the presence of C-shaped canal configurations in mandibular second molars and the incidence of multiple canals in mandibular premolars suggests that there may be a higher incidence of extra canals in mandibular teeth than initially thought.\n\nTherefore, I would recommend looking at other studies or data on this topic to get a more accurate estimate.\", \"answer_choice\": C}"]
