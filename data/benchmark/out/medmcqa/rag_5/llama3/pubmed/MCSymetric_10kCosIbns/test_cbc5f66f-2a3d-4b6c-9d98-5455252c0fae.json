["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about dynamic creep. In the provided documents, there is a paper on 'Creep after loading in relaxed and contracted smooth muscle (taenia coli of the guinea pig)' which discusses creep. Additionally, there are papers on 'Creep characteristics of the human spinal column' and 'Four aspects of creep phenomena in striated muscle' which also discuss creep. The term 'dynamic creep' is not explicitly defined in any of these papers, but based on the context it seems to refer to a type of deformation that occurs over time. In this case, dynamic creep may be the process whereby the smooth muscle or spinal column deforms over time due to applied load.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
