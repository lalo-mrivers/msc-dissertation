["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking which part of the body is underdeveloped at birth. We can look at the relevant documents to find an answer. In 'Patterns of retarded fetal growth', we see that most small-for-gestational-age infants were proportionately stunted, suggesting that this pattern of fetal growth reflects prolonged intrauterine growth retardation. This suggests that overall body size and shape may be affected. The document also mentions evaluating the degree of maturity of a new-born infant in order to detect early lateness or advance of this growth. This implies that there are variations in fetal development. Based on this information, we can infer that the underdeveloped part of the body at birth is likely related to overall size and shape.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
