["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents provided discuss different types of fetal heart rate decelerations. Decelerations of severe degree were detected during the monitoring of fetal heart rate at term, which continued despite the usual maneuvers in patient's position (document 2). The presence of decelerations is not serious and merely warn the obstetrician of the possibility of subsequent decelerations. Therefore, it can be inferred that a drop in fetal heart rate that typically lasts less than 2 minutes and usually associated with umbilical cord compression is likely to be a variable deceleration.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
