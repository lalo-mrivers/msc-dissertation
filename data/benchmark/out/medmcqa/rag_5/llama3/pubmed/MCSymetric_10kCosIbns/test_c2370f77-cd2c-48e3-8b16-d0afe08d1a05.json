["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the inter-arch distance measured when the occlusal rims are in uniform contact. From the provided documents, it can be inferred that this distance is related to the measurement of space available in the dental arch, which is discussed in the 'A computer program for the analysis of dental arch form using the cubic spline function' document. Specifically, the arc length measured by the program provides an adequate assessment of space available in the dental arch. Since the occlusal rims are in uniform contact, this distance must be equivalent to the freeway space. Therefore, the answer is A.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
