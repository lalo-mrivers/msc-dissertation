["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The lingual extension of a Lower denture refers to the posterior area of the denture that contacts the tongue. To determine the limitations of this extension, we need to consider the anatomical structures present in this region. The modiolus is a muscular structure located at the base of the tongue that may limit the lingual extension of the denture. The mylohyoid muscle and the origin of genioglossus are also important considerations as they can affect the movement and positioning of the tongue. The sublingual salivary glands are not directly related to the lingual extension of the lower denture, so we can eliminate this option.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
