["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"After reviewing the documents, I found that there is no direct information provided about sonic frequency range. However, one of the documents mentions the measurement of thresholds as minimum midfrequency shift for bands of noise with different Q factors and varying levels. This suggests that the frequency range being discussed is not limited to a specific range like 1000-2000 Hz or 1500-6000 Hz. Another document discusses the study of distortion products and finds that the lowest frequency that can be explored is 750 Hertz, which implies that frequencies below this value are not being considered. Finally, one of the documents mentions that the loudness of short sounds was compared at two frequencies, 500 and 1000 Hz, indicating that these frequencies are within the range being discussed. Based on this information, it seems that the sonic frequency range is likely to be higher than 20,000-30,000 Hz but lower than 10,000 Hz.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B: 1500-6000 Hz\""]
