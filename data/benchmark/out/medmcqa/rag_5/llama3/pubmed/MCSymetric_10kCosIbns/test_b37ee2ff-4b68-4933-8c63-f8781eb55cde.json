["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, it can be inferred that odontoblasts play a crucial role in dentin production. The functional morphology of the odontoblast cell suggests that they produce dentin, transport substances and tissue fluids, promote crystallization of enamel layers, and function as supporting cells on the end part of nerve fibres. Additionally, scanning electron microscopy studies have shown that odontoblasts display ridge formations on their surface structures, which may indicate a pseudostratified palisade layer.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
