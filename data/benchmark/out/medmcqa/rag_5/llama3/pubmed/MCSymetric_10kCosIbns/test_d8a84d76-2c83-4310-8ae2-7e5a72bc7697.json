["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents suggest that the effective attachment of the sealant to enamel requires brushing it into dry etched enamel. This implies that the wettability of the enamel plays a role in the penetration of the sealant into the fissure. Additionally, studies have shown that the use of Concise resin and its placement in the fissures looks suitable for using under in vivo circumstances too, indicating that the chemical composition of the enamel may also influence the penetration. Furthermore, an in vitro study on air-polishing occlusal surfaces shows a statistically significant increase in depth of penetration of sealant resin when cleaning with an air-polishing unit is used before fissure sealing, suggesting that the physical state of the enamel can affect the penetration. Therefore, it is likely that the chemical composition and wettability of the enamel influence the penetration of the fissure sealant.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
