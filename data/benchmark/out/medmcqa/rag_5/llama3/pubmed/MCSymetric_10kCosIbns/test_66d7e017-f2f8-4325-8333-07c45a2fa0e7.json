["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the type of innervation that stretch fibers receive. The relevant document is 'An estimate of the secondary spindle receptor afferent contribution to the stretch reflex in extensor muscles of the decerebrate cat.' This document mentions Ia afferents and group II afferents, which are types of primary and secondary spindle receptors respectively. It also talks about anodal blockade, which suggests that there is a type of fiber that carries information from the muscle spindle. Based on this information, it can be inferred that stretch fibers receive innervation through Gamma fibers.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
