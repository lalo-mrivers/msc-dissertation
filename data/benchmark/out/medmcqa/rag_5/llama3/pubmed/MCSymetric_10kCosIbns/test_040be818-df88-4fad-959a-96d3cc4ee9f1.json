["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the ability of streptococci to adhere to tooth surfaces and contribute to caries development. Reviewing the documents, we see that Streptococcus mutans is a type of streptococcus that is strongly associated with dental caries. In one document, it's mentioned that this bacteria can be transmitted within a family by saliva. Another document states that S. mutans requires the presence of teeth to inhabit the mouth and that the earlier establishment of S. mutans in the plaque of primary teeth leads to more extensive caries development. This suggests that S. mutans plays a key role in caries development. Additionally, another document discusses the characteristics of bacterial plaques on tooth surfaces, including the production of extracellular matrix by microorganisms. Based on this information, we can infer that streptococci like S. mutans have the ability to adhere to tooth surfaces through their production of extracellular polysaccharides.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"]
