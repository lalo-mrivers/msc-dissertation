["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the given documents, we can infer that histamine is present in various cells and tissues. In 'Localization and quantification of histamine in injured skin as parameters for the timing of wounds', it is mentioned that both the epidermis and upper dermis exhibit extracellular yellowish fluorescence of the HA-OPT complex, indicating the presence of histamine on the surface. Moreover, in 'Evidence for non-mast cell histamine in the vascular wall', it is stated that histamine is stored in the vascular wall in a non-mast cell pool which may well be in the smooth muscle cells themselves. This suggests that histamine can be present outside of mast cells and other specific cells.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
