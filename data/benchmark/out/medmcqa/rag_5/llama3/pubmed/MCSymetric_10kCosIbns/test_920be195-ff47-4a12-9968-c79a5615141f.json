["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with congestive heart failure, bulging anterior fontanelle with a bruit on auscultation. The USG shows a hypoechoic midline mass with dilated lateral ventricles. Considering the fontanelle pulsation sign mentioned in one of the documents, this suggests that there might be a cardiovascular malformation or disease. Given the patient's age and symptoms, it is likely that the diagnosis is related to congenital heart disease (CHD). The USG findings point towards a mass lesion affecting the ventricles. This information helps narrow down the possible diagnoses. Based on these clues, I would consider CHD with fontanelle pulsation as a potential cause of the symptoms.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
