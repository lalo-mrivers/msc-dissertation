["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to the provided documents, glucose-6-phosphatase is a multifunctional enzyme with phosphohydrolase activities. It has been demonstrated that glucose-6-phosphatase is present in various tissues including liver, pancreas, adrenals, brain, testes, spleen, and lung. The kinetic studies indicate that the enzyme shows strong affinity for glucose-6-phosphate (Km = 2.5 mM) and is a phosphohydrolase with a random mechanism. Additionally, it has been shown that glucose-6-phosphatase is present in the endoplasmic reticulum. Given this information, it can be concluded that glucose-6-phosphatase is present in the endoplasmic reticulum and cannot act on glycogen formed in the cytoplasm.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
