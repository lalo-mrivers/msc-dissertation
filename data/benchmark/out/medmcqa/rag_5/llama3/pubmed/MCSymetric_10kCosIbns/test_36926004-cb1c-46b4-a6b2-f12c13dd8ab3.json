["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the thickness of cement-dentinal junction. The relevant document for this question is 'High resolution electron microscopy in the dentino-enamel junction'. The document describes the structure of the dentino-enamel junction and mentions that dentine crystals are closely joined at the outermost dentine surface where fusions occurred. This suggests that there is no cement-dentinal junction, as the term 'cement' refers to the material between the tooth root and the surrounding bone, which is not relevant in this context.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
