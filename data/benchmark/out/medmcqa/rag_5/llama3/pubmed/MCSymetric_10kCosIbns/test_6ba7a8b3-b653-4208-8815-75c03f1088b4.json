["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Formalin is a fixative that prevents autolysis by slowing down the natural processes of tissue degradation. It makes tissues rigid by cross-linking proteins and lipids. Additionally, formalin has antimicrobial properties that kill microorganisms. The document 'Fixatives and methods of fixation in selected tissues of the laboratory rat' states that neutral buffered formalin provides better tissue preservation than immersion fixation. Furthermore, 'Formalin pigment (acid hematin) and related pigments' mentions that low pH formalin can produce an acid hematin-like pigment, which is not desirable for histological sections. This suggests that a suitable pH of the fixative should be maintained. Therefore, it is logical to conclude that 2% formaline is not used.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
