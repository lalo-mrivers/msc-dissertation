["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks for a G-protein coupled receptor that does not act through opening of potassium channels. The relevant documents mention Gi alpha s being isoforms and there existing also Gi-insensitive, Go-responsive K+ channels. This suggests that some G-protein coupled receptors may not be linked to potassium channels. The document on 'G protein-channel connection' mentions that the regulation of ion currents by hormones and neurotransmitters has focused on the role of G proteins as modulators, but does not specify which particular receptor is involved. Therefore, we need to look for other information in the documents.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
