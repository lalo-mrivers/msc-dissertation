["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking which GPCR does not act through opening of potassium channels. We need to analyze the relevant documents to find the answer. The first document mentions activation of K+ channels by alpha subunits of Gi protein, but it also raises questions about whether K+ channels are specific for one Gi and whether there are more ionic channels under direct G protein control. This suggests that not all GPCRs act through opening of potassium channels.\n\nThe second document mentions the existence of Go-responsive K+ channels, which implies that different types of G proteins can activate different ion channels.\n\nThe third document discusses the inhibition of Gk-gated K+ channel activity by G beta gamma s, which again highlights the diversity of ion channels and G protein effects on them.\n\nThe fourth document proposes roles for G beta gamma s in quenching ligand-independent G protein activation by unoccupied receptors, re-associating with GDP-G alpha s to promote interaction with receptors, and dissociating from activated R.G alpha *GTP.beta gamma to allow for receptor dissociation from GTP-activated G alpha s. This suggests that G beta gamma s are involved in various cellular responses beyond just potassium channel regulation.\n\nThe question also mentions recent interest in the regulation of ion currents by hormones and neurotransmitters, which implies that different types of GPCRs may have distinct mechanisms of action.\n\nThe last document discusses the modulation of ion channels by G proteins or phosphorylation and highlights the complexity of this area. It also mentions the diversity of potassium channels and their possible generation through molecular studies.\n\nBased on these documents, we can conclude that not all GPCRs act through opening of potassium channels. Therefore, we should look for receptors that are known to regulate other effector systems or have distinct mechanisms of action.\n\nThe answer choices include muscarinic M2 receptor, dopamine D2 receptor, serotonin 5 HT1 receptor, and angiotensin 1 receptor. We can eliminate the options related to potassium channel regulation, such as dopamine D2 receptor, which is known to regulate potassium channels (although it may also regulate other effector systems).\n\nMuscarinic M2 receptor and serotonin 5 HT1 receptor are both GPCRs that have been shown to regulate adenylyl cyclase or phospholipase C activity, rather than directly opening potassium channels. Therefore, these options do not fit the criteria.\n\nThe answer must be one of the remaining options: Angiotensin 1 receptor.\n\n\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
