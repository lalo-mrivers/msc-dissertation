["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the mandibular process. The relevant documents are about the temporomandibular joint, osteosynthesis of the mandible, and determination of the masticatory surface complex. There is no direct information about the fusion of the mandibular processes. However, the Postnatal development of the human temporomandibular joint document mentions the growth of the articular tubercle, which could be related to the mandibular process. But this does not provide information about the fusion of the processes. Therefore, I will look for general information about the mandible and its processes. The Mandibular osteosynthesis according to the Michelet technic document mentions the mandible's external cortex being strong enough to endure strains resulting from screws. This suggests that the mandible is a single bone formed by the fusion of the mandibular processes. Therefore, I can conclude that the mandibular process of each side fuse to form the Lower jaw.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
