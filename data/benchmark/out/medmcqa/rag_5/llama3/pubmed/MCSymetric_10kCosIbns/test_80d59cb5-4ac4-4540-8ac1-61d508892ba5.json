["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the pathway of parasympathetic nerve fibers to cerebral vessels from the otic ganglion in the rat. According to the document 'The pathway of parasympathetic nerve fibers to cerebral vessels from the otic ganglion in the rat', the fibers leave the otic ganglion in the lesser superficial petrosal nerve, running on the anterior and medial inner surface of the tympanic bulla to reach the greater superficial petrosal nerve, and deviate via the deep petrosal nerve to the wall of the internal carotid artery. This suggests that there is no direct innervation from the otic ganglion to cerebral vessels.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: None of the above\"\n}"]
