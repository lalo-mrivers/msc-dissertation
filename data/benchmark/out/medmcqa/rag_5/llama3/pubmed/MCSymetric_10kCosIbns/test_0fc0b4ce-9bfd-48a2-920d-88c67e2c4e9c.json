["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 26-year-old female who had a normal pregnancy until the end of it. She then developed mild hypertension during pregnancy. After delivery, she experienced a headache and seizures, but no proteinuria was present. A CT scan showed a parasagittal hematoma measuring 2 x 3 cm. Considering the symptoms and the diagnosis of sub-capsular haematoma of the liver during pregnancy (document 1), it is possible that the patient has an intrauterine hematoma or a haematoma elsewhere in the body.
