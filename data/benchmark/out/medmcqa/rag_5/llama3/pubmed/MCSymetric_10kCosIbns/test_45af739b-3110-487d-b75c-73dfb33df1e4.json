["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the circulation of toxigenic and non-toxigenic diphtheria bacilli. Phage conversion was studied in carrier state foci, where no formation of toxigenic variants as a result of phage conversion was revealed. However, corynephages were isolated from persons infected with toxigenic C. diphtheriae--in patients and carriers. The data obtained indicated that toxigenic and nontoxigenic C. diphtheriae strains were individual variants. This suggests that phage-mediated change in C. diphtheria is due to transduction, where corynephages can be transferred from one bacterium to another.\", \"answer_choice\": C}"]
