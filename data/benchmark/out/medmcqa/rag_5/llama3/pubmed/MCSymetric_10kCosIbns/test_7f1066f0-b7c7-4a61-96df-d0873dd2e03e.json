["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about chronic mercury toxicity. In the provided documents, I see that changes in activity of malate dehydrogenase and glucosephosphate isomerase in serum of rats exposed chronically to inorganic mercury and its aryl and alkyl compounds were observed. This suggests that chronic exposure can lead to toxic effects. Additionally, environmental contamination by mercury in Iraq reports on fish and bird specimens with high concentrations of mercury, indicating that prolonged exposure can result in toxicity.\", \"answer_choice\": D}"]
