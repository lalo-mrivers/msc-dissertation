["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about Patellar clunk syndrome which is interposition of soft tissue at or hyperophied scar. We need to look for lesions that are related to patella and its surrounding tissues. The documents describe various lesions of the patella such as dislocation, dorsal defect, chondromalacia patellae, and external hypertension syndrome.
