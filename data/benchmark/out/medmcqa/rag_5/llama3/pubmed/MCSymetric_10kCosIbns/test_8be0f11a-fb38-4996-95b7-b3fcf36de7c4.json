["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking which of the given diseases is NOT transmitted by a particular method. The relevant documents discuss non-sexual transmission of sexually transmissible diseases, virus infections, and pathogenicity. There is no mention of Kala Azar, Chandipura encephalitis, Babesiosis, or Carrion's Disease in these documents. Therefore, I will analyze the diseases mentioned: smallpox, poliomyelitis, measles, rubella, epidemic virus hepatitis (virus A), and rabies. All these diseases are transmitted by non-sexual means, such as parturition from mothers with anogenital diseases, exchange of underwear, towels, bed sharing, or use of contaminated speculum and forceps. Since none of the given options are mentioned in the documents, I will assume that they are not transmitted by non-sexual means.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
