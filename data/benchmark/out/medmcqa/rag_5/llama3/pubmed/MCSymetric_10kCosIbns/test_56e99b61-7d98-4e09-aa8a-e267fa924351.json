["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about where receptors for olfactory sensation are present. From the documents provided, we can see that the olfactory cells are involved in the formation of the olfactory border and have cilia-like processes that undergo continuous regeneration. The document also mentions the presence of specialized olfactory cell types in some teleosts. Furthermore, the molecular basis of signal transduction in olfactory sensory neurons suggests that the receptor family described by Buck and Axel (1991) do indeed bind odorants. These receptors are expressed on the surface of olfactory sensory neurons. Spatial distribution of the EOG in the rat shows a non-homogeneous distribution of different receptors, with each substance giving a spatial pattern of response efficiency.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: None of the above\""]
