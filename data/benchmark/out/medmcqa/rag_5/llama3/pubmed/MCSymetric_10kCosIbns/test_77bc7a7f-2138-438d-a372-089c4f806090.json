["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the presence of microvilli in different parts of the human body. We need to look for information that mentions the absence of microvilli in these areas. The first document talks about branching microvilli in nasal respiratory epithelium, but it doesn't mention the absence of microvilli anywhere else. The second document discusses the configuration of surfaces of human cancer cells and their microvilli, which is not relevant to this question. The third document explains a method for preparing intestinal villi and mentions atrophy of villi with hypertrophy and hyperplasia of Paneth cells in isolated ileal loops, but it doesn't mention microvilli's presence or absence elsewhere. The fourth document discusses the regulation of surface topography of mouse peritoneal cells and formation of microvilli on omental mesothelial cells, which is not relevant to this question. Based on our analysis, we can conclude that none of the mentioned areas have been proven to lack microvilli.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"None of the above\"\n}"]
