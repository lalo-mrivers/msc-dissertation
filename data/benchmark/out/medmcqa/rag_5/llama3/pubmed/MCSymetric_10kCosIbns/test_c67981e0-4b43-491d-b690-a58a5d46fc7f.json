["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents provided describe facial orthopedic masks used for skeletal Class III malocclusions. The model presented in the first document simulates the forces exerted by the mask on the chin and forehead. Although the model is based on simplifications, it shows that the computation of the forces (in orientation and magnitude) at the forehead and chin is possible. Since the direction of force by Class III elastic in a face mask is not explicitly mentioned in the provided documents, we can infer that the direction of force might be related to the simulation model presented in the first document. This leads us to examine the cephalometric data and geometry of the mask used in the model.\",\n\"answer_choice\": A"]
