["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question describes a 10-month-old baby who suddenly becomes distressed with normal external genitalia except for hyperpigmentation. The blood glucose level is low at 30 mg%. Given the age of the patient and the clinical presentation, I think it's unlikely that this is related to any of the options related to premature birth or congenital disorders.\n\nThe most likely explanation is a hormonal disorder affecting cortisol production, which could be caused by one of the options listed. The hyperpigmentation suggests an excess of androgens, which would be consistent with 21-hydroxylase deficiency (option A) or Cushing's syndrome (option D).\n\nFamilial glucocorticoid deficiency (option C) is a rare disorder that typically presents in infancy, but it can also occur in older children. However, the hyperpigmentation and low blood glucose level are not typical features of this condition.\n\nHyperinsulinism (option B) is a possible explanation for the hypoglycemia, but it would not typically cause hyperpigmentation or other signs of excess androgens.\n\nBased on these considerations, I think the most probable diagnosis is 21-hydroxylase deficiency (option A).\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
