["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about increasing radio density. Radio density refers to the amount of radiation absorbed per unit mass of tissue. The relevant documents provided do not directly discuss radio density or its increase. However, we can find related concepts that might be useful in answering this question.\n\nFrom [Dosimetry in setting practical hygienic standards for radio-wave irradiation], we know that dosimeters are used to monitor the hygienic norms of superhigh frequency electromagnetic waves. The devices have autonomic power supply and digital indication of current exposure dose.\n\nIn [Characterization of radiation within the optical region (author's transl)], we find that quantities from the international system (SI-System) are stressed, which includes units related to radiation measurement.\n\nFrom [The prediction of the temperature conditions in mobile installations of ground radio electronics systems], we learn about formulas for estimating air temperature inside manned sectors. This is not directly relevant to increasing radio density.\n\nFinally, [Discussion paper: Strong dependence of whole animal absorption on polarization and frequency or radio-frequency energy] discusses absorption characteristics of rats and brain-phantom prolate spheroidal bodies under different orientations and frequencies. While this does not explicitly discuss radio density increase, it implies that the absorption depends on factors like size, shape, and orientation.\n\nConsidering these points, we can conclude that increasing radio density might be achieved by...\", \n\"answer_choice\": \"D: Increasing target film distance\""]
