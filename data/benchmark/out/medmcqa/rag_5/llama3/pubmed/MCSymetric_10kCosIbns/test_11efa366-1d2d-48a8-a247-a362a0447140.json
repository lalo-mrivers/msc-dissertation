["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The studies provided describe the process of plaque formation on tooth surfaces. According to 'Development of bacterial plaque in the oral cavity', plaque is formed by oral microorganisms which attach to the teeth in sheltered areas and increases in quantity either by multiplication of already attached organisms or by continuous addition to the deposits of bacteria from the saliva. This suggests that plaque formation is a gradual process that occurs over time. Additionally, 'In vivo early human dental plaque formation on different supporting substances' study shows that all 4-hour specimens exhibited various areas covered by plaque, indicating that plaque starts forming within a short period of time. Therefore, it can be inferred that plaque formation takes place within the first few hours after cleaning and pumicing the tooth surface.\", \"answer_choice\": C}"]
