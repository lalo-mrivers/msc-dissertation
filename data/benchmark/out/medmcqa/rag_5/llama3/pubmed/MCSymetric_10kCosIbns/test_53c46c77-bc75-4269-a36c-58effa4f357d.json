["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about a patient with high caries index and minimum horizontal overlap of maxillary central incisors. Since the patient has high caries index, we need to consider the durability of the crown material.

Considering these factors, a metal-ceramic or porcelain jacket crown would provide better protection against caries and also help in masking any tooth size discrepancies.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
