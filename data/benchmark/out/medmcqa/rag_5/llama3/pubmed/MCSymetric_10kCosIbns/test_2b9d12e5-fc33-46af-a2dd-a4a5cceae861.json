["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"After reviewing the provided documents, we can see that there are multiple instances where serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT) is increased. In the document 'Mitochondrial glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase and its clinical significance', it is mentioned that in acute hepatitis, SGOT rose to 100 units or approximately. Additionally, in the document 'Clinical significance of mitochondrial glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase in serum of patients with liver disease', it is reported that patients with acute hepatitis had an average value of 8.3 mU, which indicates increased SGOT activity. Furthermore, in the same document, a patient with fulminant hepatitis showed an extremely high value of 295 mU, revealing significant elevation of SGOT.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
