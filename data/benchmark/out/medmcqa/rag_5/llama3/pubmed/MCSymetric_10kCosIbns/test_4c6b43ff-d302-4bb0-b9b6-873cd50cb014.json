["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks which of the given options is not a physiological method of heat loss from the body. From the provided documents, we can infer that sweating is indeed a physiological method of heat loss as it involves evaporation of sweat to cool the body (Experimental determination of coefficient of evaporative heat loss in still air). Vasodilation and vasoconstriction are also physiological responses related to thermoregulation, although they do not directly involve heat loss from the body (Direct calorimetry: a new clinical approach for measuring thermoregulatory responses in man). Posture is not a physiological method of heat loss. Therefore, the correct answer is C: Posture.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
