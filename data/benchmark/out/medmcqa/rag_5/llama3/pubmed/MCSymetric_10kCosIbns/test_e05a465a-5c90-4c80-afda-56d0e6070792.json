["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Firstly, we need to analyze the documents provided. The first document talks about Natal primary molar, which is a rare occurrence. It does not provide information about the number of roots and canals of Maxillary first molar. The second document discusses maxillary anterior displacement and impaction in mixed dentition, but it does not specify the root and canal anatomy of Maxillary first molar. The third document studies the external anatomy of Maxillary molars, including root length and curvature. It suggests that there is similarity between Maxillary first and second molars, which are single-rooted. The fourth document examines the root form and canal anatomy of Maxillary first premolars. According to this study, 55.8% of Maxillary first premolars had a single root, while considering all the teeth, 17.1% had one canal, 80.4% had two canals, and none had three. The fifth document describes an unusual case of ectopic eruption of a mandibular permanent molar. It does not provide information about Maxillary first molar.\n\nBased on these documents, we cannot find any specific information about the number of roots and canals of Maxillary first molar. Therefore, we should rely on general anatomical knowledge or other reliable sources for this information. The answer choice that is most consistent with our analysis is D: 2 roots and 4 canals.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
