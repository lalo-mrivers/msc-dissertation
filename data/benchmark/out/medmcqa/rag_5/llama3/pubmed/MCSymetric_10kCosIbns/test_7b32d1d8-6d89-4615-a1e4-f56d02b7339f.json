["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the tooth with a non-functional cusp. The first thing to note is that the provided documents don't explicitly state which teeth have functional or non-functional cusps. However, we can infer information from the texts. For example, talon cusp is mentioned as a rare dental anomaly that can affect both deciduous and permanent dentitions. This suggests that not all teeth have functional cusps.\n\nFurther, the text about cusp writer findings discusses the correlation between cusp angulations and occlusal determinants. This implies that the shape and function of the cusps are related to the overall oral environment. Given this context, it's reasonable to assume that some teeth may have non-functional cusps.\n\nThe document about the distribution of nerves in human deciduous and permanent teeth doesn't provide direct information on functional or non-functional cusps. However, it does mention that the deciduous teeth are less sensitive than their permanent successors, which could be related to differences in cusp shape and function.\n\nBased on this analysis, we can conclude that some teeth may have non-functional cusps, but without further information, it's difficult to pinpoint a specific tooth.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B: Upper 1st premolar\""]
