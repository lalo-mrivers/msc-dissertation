["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the effectiveness of CHX mouthwash in reducing Streptococcus mutanus. The relevant document is 'Effect of an experimental antiplaque preparation on salivary microbial counts in military academy cadets refraining from mechanical cleaning of the teeth.' According to this document, the study showed a significant decrease in salivary mutants streptococci after rinsing periods with XYLIHEX and CHX when compared with F (p less than 0.001). This suggests that CHX mouthwash is effective in reducing Streptococcus mutanus. Since the question asks about daily use till 2 weeks, we can conclude that the effectiveness of CHX mouthwash for Streptococcus mutanus is up to 2 weeks.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
