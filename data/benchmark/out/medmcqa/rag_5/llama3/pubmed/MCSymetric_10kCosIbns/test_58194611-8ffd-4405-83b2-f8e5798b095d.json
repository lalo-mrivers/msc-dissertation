["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about what is included in active tissue engineering. Based on the provided documents, it can be inferred that active tissue engineering involves the use of cell culture technology as a foundation for tissue engineering, reconstitution of blood vessels, and development of bioartificial organs. The term 'active' suggests that this type of tissue engineering is focused on promoting cellular activity and growth.\n\nComparing this to the options provided, it can be seen that antigens fibroblasts (A) are not directly related to active tissue engineering, as they do not fit within the scope of cell culture technology, reconstitution of blood vessels, or development of bioartificial organs.\n\nBilayered cell therapy (B) is a potential approach in active tissue engineering, as it involves the use of multiple layers of cells for tissue repair and regeneration.\n\nEnamel matrix derivative (C) is not directly related to active tissue engineering, as enamel is a type of dental material that does not fit within the scope of biological substitutes to restore, maintain or improve functions.\n\nAcellular dermal matrix (D) is a type of biomaterial that can be used in tissue engineering applications, but it is not specifically 'active' in the sense that it does not promote cellular activity and growth. Therefore, option D is also not directly related to active tissue engineering.\",\n\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
