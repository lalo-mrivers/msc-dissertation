["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to the document [Aging effect on mechanical properties in fluid resin. (Part 1).], an excessive amount of monomer can lead to evaporation of MMA, which improves the mechanical properties. However, this is mainly due to weight loss at the surface, not affecting the molecular weight of PMMA. To improve the mechanical properties of fluid resin, it is necessary to decrease residual monomer as much as possible in the fluid resin, especially at the surface area.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
