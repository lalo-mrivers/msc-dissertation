["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Non-visualization of the gallbladder in hepatic scintigraphy is a common finding. Reviewing the case reports, we see that non-specific focal defects are identified with 99mTc-sulfur colloid imaging procedures. In one report, a prominent scintigraphic defect was shown to be a normally functioning gallbladder. Another report describes an ectopic gallbladder localized by cholecystography and 131I-rose bengal studies. The aberrant gallbladder can also produce false positive liver scans which were correctly diagnosed by hepatic angiography. In this scenario, the non-visualization of gallbladder in hepatic scintigraphy could be due to an anomalous position of the gallbladder.\", \"answer_choice\": C}"]
