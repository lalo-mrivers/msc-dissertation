["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the documents provided, it's clear that we're dealing with cranial measurements. The first document mentions asymmetry and correlations in descriptive properties of the cranium. The second document discusses systematic degradation of information collected from a skull by metric study due to traditional quantitative methods used in cranial morphology. This makes me think about potential errors or inconsistencies in cranial measurement data. The third document presents radiological and statistical determination of morphological types of canine skulls, which doesn't seem directly relevant to the question at hand. The fourth document discusses computed tomography for evaluating pediatric cranium abnormalities. Finally, the fifth document provides a method for determining cranial capacity using endocranial dimensions. Considering these points, I'll choose an answer.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B: 5% reduction\"\n}"]
