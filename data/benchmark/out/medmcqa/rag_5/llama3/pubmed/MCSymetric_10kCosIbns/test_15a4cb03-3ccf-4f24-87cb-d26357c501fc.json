["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the problem associated with wide divergent roots of primary teeth. Primary teeth are smaller than permanent teeth, so we should look for information about primary molars and their root anatomy. The document '[The anatomical characteristics of the root furcations in the molar teeth]' talks about the anatomy of molar teeth, including primary molars. It mentions that the radicular angle, root length, and furcal area width undergo a reduction from first to second molar. This information suggests that the roots of primary molars might be wider than those of permanent molars. However, there is no direct evidence in this document about the problems associated with wide divergent roots of primary teeth.\n\nThe other documents provided do not directly relate to the problem mentioned in the question. Therefore, we should focus on the information available in '[The anatomical characteristics of the root furcations in the molar teeth]'. The study found that a long radicular trunk is associated with a more apical placement of the furcation entrance and this situation, in conjunction with a narrow inter-radicular angle, can obstruct the insertion of therapeutic instruments. This might be relevant to the problem mentioned in the question.\n\nHowever, it seems that the question is asking about primary teeth, and the document '[The anatomical characteristics of the root furcations in the molar teeth]' talks about permanent molars. Therefore, we should also consider other documents that provide information about primary molars.\n\nUnfortunately, none of the provided documents directly address the problem associated with wide divergent roots of primary teeth. Therefore, it seems that there is no clear answer to this question based on the given documents.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: None\""]
