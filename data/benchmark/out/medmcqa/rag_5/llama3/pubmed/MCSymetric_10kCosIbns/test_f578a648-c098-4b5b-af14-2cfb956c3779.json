["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about numbness and tingling sensation felt in the anterior one third of the tongue. The relevant documents describe various conditions affecting the tongue, such as post-traumatic ischemic necrosis, atherosclerosis, lipoma, and cancer. None of these conditions seem to be related to numbness and tingling sensation. Therefore, I will focus on other possible causes. The text does not mention any internal or neurological diseases that could cause numbness and tingling in the tongue. However, dental and psychiatric diseases are mentioned as possible causes of burning tongue. Dental diseases could potentially cause numbness and tingling sensations in the tongue.
