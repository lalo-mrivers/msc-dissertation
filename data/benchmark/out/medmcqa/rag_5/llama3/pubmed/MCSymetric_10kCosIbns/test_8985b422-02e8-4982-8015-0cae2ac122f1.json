["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for the option that is NOT used in management of overdosage of Fibrinolytics. From the given documents, there are no mentions of Fibrinolytics or their management. However, we can infer from the context that Fibrinolytics refer to blood clotting agents, such as fibrinolytic agents like streptokinase. The options provided include Epsilon amino Caproic Acid (EACA), Tranexamic Acid, DDAVP, and FFP.\n\nFrom our understanding of medical literature, we know that EACA is used as an antifibrinolytic agent to prevent bleeding in patients with hemorrhagic disorders or those undergoing surgery. Tranexamic acid is also used to prevent bleeding by inhibiting plasminogen activation and subsequent fibrinolysis.\n\nDDAVP (desmopressin) is a vasopressin analog that stimulates the release of von Willebrand factor and factor VIII from endothelial cells, increasing platelet adhesion and aggregation. It is used in the management of bleeding disorders such as hemophilia A.\n\nFresh Frozen Plasma (FFP) is a blood product rich in coagulation factors, including fibrinogen, prothrombin, and factors V, VII, VIII, IX, X, XI, and XII. It is often used to treat bleeding due to coagulopathy or factor deficiencies.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C: DDAVP, as it is not an antifibrinolytic agent like EACA, Tranexamic acid, or FFP.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
