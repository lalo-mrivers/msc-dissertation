["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the salivary gland output in Sjögren's syndrome. The relevant documents mention whole unstimulated salivary flows, which are lower in patients with primary Sjögren's syndrome compared to controls and rheumatoid arthritis patients. Ultrasonography and sialography of parotid glands were also performed on patients with Sjögren's syndrome, showing characteristic changes. Salivary SPECT and factor analysis were used to detect small differences in the level of uptake, separating glands from background even when uptake is reduced as in patients with Sjögren's syndrome.\n\nThe documents do not mention any increase in sodium concentration, phosphate concentration, or IgA concentration in salivary gland output in Sjögren's syndrome. Therefore, option D is not true about the salivary gland output in Sjögren's syndrome.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
