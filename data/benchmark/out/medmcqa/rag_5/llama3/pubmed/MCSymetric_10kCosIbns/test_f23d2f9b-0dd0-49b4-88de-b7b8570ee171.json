["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the given documents, it is understood that apoptosis plays a crucial role in removing unwanted cells. Defective apoptosis can lead to increased cell survival, which may contribute to various diseases. The documents mention the bcl-2 gene, which provides longevity to memory B cells and renders lymphoma cells resistant to apoptosis when translocated. Similarly, latent membrane protein encoded by an EBV gene enables tumour cells to resist apoptotic death. These findings suggest that defective apoptosis is associated with increased cell survival.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
