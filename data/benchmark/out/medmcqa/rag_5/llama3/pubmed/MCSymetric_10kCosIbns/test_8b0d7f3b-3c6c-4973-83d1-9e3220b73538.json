["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about how hepcidin decreases iron absorption. Hepcidin is a protein that regulates iron metabolism by inhibiting the release of iron from intestinal enterocytes into the circulation. This process occurs through inhibition of ferroportin, a transmembrane protein responsible for exporting iron from enterocytes. Ferroportin is the primary route of iron efflux from intestinal cells.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B: Ferropoin\"\n}"]
