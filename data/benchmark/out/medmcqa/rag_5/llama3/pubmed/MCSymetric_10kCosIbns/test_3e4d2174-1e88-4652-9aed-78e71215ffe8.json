["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the given documents, we can see that vitamin D toxicity is associated with hypercalcaemia. In one of the case reports, a family of three presented with symptoms of hypercalcaemia due to massive acute vitamin D overdosage. The father and mother's plasma vitamin D levels were 55 and 60 i.u./ml respectively, which is higher than the normal range. The infant responded quickly to prednisone therapy. In another case report, two patients died from complications despite successful lowering of serum calcium, and a third patient died after a pulmonary embolus during hypercalcaemia. This suggests that high doses of vitamin D can cause serious clinical problems. Therefore, treatment for vitamin D toxicity should aim to reduce serum calcium levels.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
