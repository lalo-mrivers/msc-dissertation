["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is experiencing tingling sensation in the limbs, which suggests a peripheral neuropathy. Anti-tubercular therapy (ATT) can cause peripheral neuropathy as an adverse effect. Thiamine, Pyridoxine, Folic acid and Methylcobalamine are all B vitamins that play important roles in maintaining proper nerve function. Since the patient is experiencing tingling sensation, it's likely that a deficiency of one or more of these B vitamins is contributing to their symptoms.\\r\\n\\r\\nLet's examine each option: A) Thiamine - while thiamine is an important nutrient for nervous system function, there is no strong evidence that substituting thiamine for ATT would specifically address the patient's symptoms. B) Pyridoxine - pyridoxine (vitamin B6) is a co-factor for many enzymes involved in amino acid metabolism and is often used to treat peripheral neuropathy caused by vitamin deficiency. Substituting pyridoxine for ATT could potentially improve the patient's symptoms. C) Folic acid - folic acid is an essential nutrient for preventing megaloblastic anemia, but it doesn't have a direct role in treating peripheral neuropathy. D) Methylcobalamine - methylcobalamin (vitamin B12) is important for maintaining proper nerve function and can be used to treat vitamin B12 deficiency-induced peripheral neuropathy.\\r\\n\\r\\nBased on the information provided, substituting Pyridoxine for ATT could result in improvement of symptoms.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
