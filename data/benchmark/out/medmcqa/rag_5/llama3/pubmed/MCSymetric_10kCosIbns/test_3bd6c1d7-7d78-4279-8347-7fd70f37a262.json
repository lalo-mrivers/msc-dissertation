["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the trigger for myosin head detachment from actin. From the provided documents, we know that heavy meromyosin (HMM) binds to actin with negative cooperativity and that myosin heads swing on actin as fairly rigid structures during contraction. The binding of ATP to HMM heads is also mentioned in the context of actin-binding studies. Based on this information, it is reasonable to conclude that the detachment of myosin heads from actin is triggered by the hydrolysis of ATP to ADP and Pi.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
