["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe genomic imprinting as a phenomenon where the expression of genes is influenced by their parental origin. The molecular mechanism of imprinting involves epigenetic modifications of parental alleles, which can affect their potential for expression. DNA methylation is mentioned as one of the possible epigenetic modifications that can occur progressively and influence the expression of parental alleles.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
