["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, a diarthrosis is defined as a joint that allows for free movement between two bones. From [Morphofunctional basis of joint typology], we can see that every joint can be regarded as highly-, moderately- and stiffly-mobile, according to the degree of relative shift of the connected links. This suggests that diarthroses are characterized by their ability to accommodate varying degrees of movement.\n\nFrom [Development of the diarthrodial joints in the rat embryo], we can see that diarthroses develop through a sequence of cellular events leading to full expression of phenotypic characteristics. This includes cell condensation, three-layered mesenchyme, vascular invasion, and joint clefting.\n\nFinally, from [The distal radioulnar joint], we can see that the distal radioulnar joint is an example of a diarthrosis, allowing for rotation while preserving stability and transmitting load to both bones of the forearm.\n\nWith this information in mind, let's consider each option:\n\nA: Plane - This does not seem to be a type of joint that allows for free movement between two bones. Therefore, it is unlikely to be a diarthrosis.\n\nB: Symphyses - Symphyses are a type of joint where the bones are connected by fibrous connective tissue and allow for limited movement. While symphyses do not have the same degree of mobility as diarthroses, they can still be considered a type of joint that allows for some movement between two bones.\n\nC: Condyloid - This is a type of joint that allows for free movement in one plane, which is consistent with the definition of a diarthrosis. Therefore, it is likely to be a type of joint that falls under this category.\n\nD: Saddle - A saddle joint is a type of joint that allows for movement in multiple planes and is characterized by its saddle-like shape. This type of joint does allow for free movement between two bones and is consistent with the definition of a diarthrosis. Therefore, it is likely to be a type of joint that falls under this category.\n\nBased on our analysis, all options except A (Plane) are likely to be types of diarthroses.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
