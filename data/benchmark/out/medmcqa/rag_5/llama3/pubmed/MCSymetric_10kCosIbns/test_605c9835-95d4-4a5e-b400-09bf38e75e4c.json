["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a school girl with complaints of dropping objects from hands, which gets precipitated during morning and during exams. She has no history of loss of consciousness. Her cousin sister has been diagnosed with epilepsy. EEG shows epileptic spikes. From the documents provided, it's clear that the main issue here is not the type of seizure, but rather how classmates' fear and hostility affect her school performance. The patient's scholastic record is also affected by the depressive reaction she experiences. Given this information, we can infer that the patient may have some form of learning problem or behavioral disturbance. According to 'Behavior and learning problems in epileptic children', 70% of children with seizures show significant learning defects, and the remaining 30% still experience minor learning problems. This suggests that our patient's complaints may be related to learning difficulties rather than a specific type of seizure.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
