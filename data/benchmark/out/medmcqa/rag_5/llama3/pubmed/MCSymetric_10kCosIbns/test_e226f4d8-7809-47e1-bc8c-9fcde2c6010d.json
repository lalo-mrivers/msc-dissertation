["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the concept of phenotype. From the given documents, it can be inferred that the papers discuss various aspects of nature-nurture data interpretation, genetic traits, medical genetics, and familial correlations in judgment. None of these topics directly relate to the modification of phenotype with the passage of time. However, one paper discusses how genetic variation plays a role in human affairs and how some traits may not run in families due to configurational effects rather than simple sum of polymorphic genes. This suggests that genotype can influence phenotype. Therefore, options A and C can be eliminated as they are related to the modification of phenotype with time or the genetic sequence itself.\n\nThe remaining options B and D appear to be correct descriptions of phenotype. However, option C is incorrect because it refers to a genetic sequence, whereas phenotype is the expression of that sequence. Option B correctly describes the appearance or expression of an individual's characteristics.\n\nTherefore, the answer choice would be C: It is genetic sequence of an individual.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
