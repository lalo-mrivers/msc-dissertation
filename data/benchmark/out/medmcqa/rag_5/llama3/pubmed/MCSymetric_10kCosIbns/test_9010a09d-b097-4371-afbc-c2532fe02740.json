["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents mention phase-contrast microscopy as a method for visualizing microscopic specimens. In 'Phase and amplitude contrast in electron microscopy of stained biological objects', it is mentioned that Scherzer's phase contrast imaging conditions are used to produce high-contrast images. This suggests that the principle behind phase-contrast microscopy is based on the manipulation of light waves, rather than reflective or attenuated indices.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
