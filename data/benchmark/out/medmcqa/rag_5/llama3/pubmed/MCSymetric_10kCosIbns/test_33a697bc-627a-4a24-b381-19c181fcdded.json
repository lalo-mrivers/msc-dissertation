["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the method of choice for a newborn child not passing urine for 36 hours. We can analyze the relevant documents to find information related to urination patterns in newborns. The first document 'Times of first void and first stool in 500 newborns' provides information on the timing of urination in newborns. However, it does not specifically mention a situation where a newborn child does not pass urine for 36 hours. The other documents do not provide any direct information on this topic either.

This is because they are non-invasive, easy to perform, and can provide valuable information about the urinary system.\",\n\"answer_choice\": A"]
