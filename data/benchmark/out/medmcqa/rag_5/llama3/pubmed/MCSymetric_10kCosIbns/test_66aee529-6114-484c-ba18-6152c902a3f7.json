["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking when NK cells are effective against viral infected cells. From the given documents, we know that individual NK cell clones lyse both tumor cell targets and herpes simplex virus-infected fibroblasts in the absence of interferon. We also know that NK cells can recognize retrovirus-infected cells as evidenced by rapid conjugation, but that neither freshly isolated nor IL-2-stimulated cells cause lysis of such targets. However, removal of sialic acid residues rendered the retrovirus-infected target cells vulnerable to NK cell attack. From this information, we can conclude that NK cells are effective against viral infected cells when the cell is unable to express MHC class I proteins.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
