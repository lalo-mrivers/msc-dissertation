["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with hypertension, blurring of vision, and headache at 36 weeks gestation. The blood pressure reading is 180/120 mm Hg initially and remains elevated at 174/110 mm Hg after 20 minutes. This suggests a severe case of pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH). According to the documents, PIH can be classified into two types: absolute PIH (A-PIH) diagnosed by systolic blood pressure ≥ 140 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure ≥ 90 mm Hg; and relative-PIH (R-PIH) diagnosed by an increase in systolic blood pressure ≥ 30 mm Hg compared to the usual blood pressure or an increase in diastolic blood pressure ≥ 15 mm Hg. In this case, the patient's blood pressure is significantly elevated, suggesting A-PIH.\n\nThe literature suggests that patients with a positive RT (roll over test) have a lower risk of developing PIH compared to those with a negative RT. However, it does not provide specific guidance on managing severe PIH at 36 weeks gestation.\n\nConsidering the patient's symptoms and blood pressure reading, it is essential to prioritize her maternal and fetal well-being by initiating treatment and monitoring her closely. Magnesium sulfate (MgSO4) has been recommended as a possible treatment option for PIH in pregnancy.\n\nBased on this information, the best course of action would be to admit the patient, start antihypertensives, and administer MgSO4, with the goal of continuing the pregnancy until term.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: C: Admit the patient, start antihypertensives, MgSO4 and terminate the pregnancy\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"]
