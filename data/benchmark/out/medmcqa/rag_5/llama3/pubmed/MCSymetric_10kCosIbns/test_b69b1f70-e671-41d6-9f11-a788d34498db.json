["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents discuss post-translational chemical modifications of proteins. The question asks which amino acid does not include post-translational modification. I will review the options provided: A: Selenocystiene, B: Triiodothyronine, C: Hydroxy-proline, D: Hydroxy-lysine. Post-translational modifications are discussed as affecting various amino acids, including serine and threonine (phosphorylation), proline (hydroxylation), lysine (hydroxylation). The documents do not mention selenocystiene or triiodothyronine as being affected by post-translational modifications.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
