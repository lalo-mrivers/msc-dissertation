["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents provided discuss various craniofacial defects and deformities. The term 'brachycephaly' is used to describe a condition characterized by a short skull or head shape. In the study of craniofacial form, it is mentioned that there are differences in the craniofacial skeleton between brachycephalics and dolichocephalics. This suggests that brachycephaly is related to the shape of the skull. Among the given options, sagittal suture and lambdoid suture are not directly related to the shape of the skull. Parietal suture and coronal suture are also not mentioned in relation to brachycephaly. However, the study suggests that there may be a connection between the craniofacial skeleton and the shape of the skull. Therefore, it is likely that brachycephaly is due to fusion of the\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
