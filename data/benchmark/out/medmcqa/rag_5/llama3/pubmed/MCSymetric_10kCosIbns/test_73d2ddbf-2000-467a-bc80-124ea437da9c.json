["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the effects of surgery on the maxilla (upper jawbone) and facial profile in patients with cleft lip and/or palate. The documents specifically mention that reconstructive surgery in patients with complete unilateral cleft lip, alveolus, and palate leads to a severe maxillary retroposition associated with downward rotation. There is no evidence of any studies or findings that suggest surgery on the hard palate inhibits growth and causes the facial profile to become shortened. Therefore, we can rule out options C: Shortened and D: More concave.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
