["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the periodontal fibers that are consistent and reconstructed even after the destruction of the alveolar bone. From the provided documents, we can see that the zone of completely and partially destructed periodontal fibres in pathological pockets was studied. The morphology, width, and appearance frequency of this zone were examined. Additionally, the concept of guided tissue regeneration leading to the regeneration with active periodontal ligament cells is mentioned. Furthermore, the histological study of remains of periodontal membrane at the alveolar wall after tooth extraction shows that dynamic cells and dilated vessels can be observed in the area.\n\nConsidering these findings, it seems that apical fibres are consistent and reconstructed even after the destruction of the alveolar bone. This is because the zone of completely and partially destructed periodontal fibres was found to consist only a few fibres without any specific orientation, but the presence of dynamic cells and dilated vessels in the area suggests that apical fibres can be regenerated.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
