["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"None of the provided documents mention anything about natural dentition or removing centric interference and working interference by reducing supporting cusps. The documents discuss theoretical physical thoughts on masticatory stability of complete dentures, the effect of a new resin inlay/onlay restorative material on cuspal reinforcement, investigation of strain produced in maxillary complete dentures in function, compatibility of dentures made from precious metals and from corrosion-resistant steels with nitride coatings, and four variables affecting magnitude of dentrifice abrasiveness. Therefore, we cannot make any conclusions about the possibility of removing centric interference and working interference by reducing supporting cusps.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
