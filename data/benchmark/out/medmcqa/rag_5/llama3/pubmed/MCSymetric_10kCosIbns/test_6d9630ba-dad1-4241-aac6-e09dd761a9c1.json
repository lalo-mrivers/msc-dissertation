["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, we can analyze the possible causes of microcephaly. From the [Experimental studies on the etiological mechanism of congenital microcephaly] document, we know that cytosine arabinoside (ara-C) treatment in pregnant mice leads to microcephaly in their offspring. However, this study is focused on the experimental induction of microcephaly and does not provide information about maternal disorders causing microcephaly.\n\nThe [Genetic analysis of microcephaly] document discusses the inheritance pattern of microcephaly, but it also does not provide specific information about maternal disorders leading to microcephaly.\n\nThe [Clinical manifestations and genetic aspects of true microcephaly] document provides general information about the characteristics of true microcephaly, including its inheritance as an autosomal recessive trait. However, this study is focused on the clinical and genetic features of microcephaly itself, rather than the causes of it.\n\nThe [Dominantly inherited microcephaly, short stature and normal intelligence] document describes a different type of microcephaly that is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. This document does not provide information about maternal disorders causing microcephaly either.\n\nBased on this analysis, we can conclude that none of the provided documents directly address the question of which maternal disorder leads to microcephaly in the baby. Therefore, we must rely on our general knowledge and external sources to answer this question.\", \n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
