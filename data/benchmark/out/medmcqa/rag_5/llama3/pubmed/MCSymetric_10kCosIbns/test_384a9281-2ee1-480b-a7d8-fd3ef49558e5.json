["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, we can analyze the anatomy of arrested root caries lesions. The main structural characteristics include a completely mineralized surface area, formation of sclerosis of dentinal tubules, and fully mineralized intertubular dentin up to the surface. Dentinal tubules near the surface are either filled with ghosts of microorganisms or crystals. This suggests that the spread of dental caries is not primarily driven by enamel spindles, enamel lamellae, or Striae of Retzius, which are all related to enamel structure. The dentinoenamel junction is a more plausible candidate for facilitating lateral spread of dental caries.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
