["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about LA's action on the nerve membrane. We need to find a relevant document that discusses the chemical composition of the axolemma and how it compares with other membranes. The first document talks about the molecular mechanisms involved in the generation and conduction of nerve impulses, but it does not specifically mention LA. The second document discusses changes in nerve and muscle produced by long-term nerve ligation, but it is not directly related to LA's action on the nerve membrane. The third document talks about synaptic organization and acetylcholine sensitivity of multiply innervated autonomic ganglion cells, which is not relevant to the question either. The fourth document discusses ultrastructural localization of gangliosides, calcium and a high-affinity Ca(2+)-ATPase in nerve terminals, but it does not mention LA. However, the last document talks about [Ca2+ channels and the abnormal electrical activity of demyelinated nerve], which mentions LA's action on the nerve membrane. According to this document, LA acts by blocking conductance of Ca2+, which is not one of the options provided.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
