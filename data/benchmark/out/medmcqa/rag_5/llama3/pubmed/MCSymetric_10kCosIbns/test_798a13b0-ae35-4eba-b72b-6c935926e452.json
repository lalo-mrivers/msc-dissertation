["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the swelling and redness of the orifices of minor salivary glands of the palate. The relevant documents mention adenomatoid hyperplasia as a rare idiopathic non-inflammatory, non-neoplastic and benign lesion of minor salivary glands that typically presents with a tumour-like mass in the palate.
