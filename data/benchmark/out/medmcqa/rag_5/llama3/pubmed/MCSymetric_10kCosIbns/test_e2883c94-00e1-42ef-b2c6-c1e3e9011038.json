["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the oculomotor nerve. We need to identify which option is NOT true about it. From the provided documents, we can see that the oculomotor nerve carries parasympathetic fibers (document [The autonomic division of oculomotor nerve nuclei in mammals and during human development]). This information contradicts option A.\n\nOptions B and C are not relevant to the provided documents and therefore cannot be verified or refuted. Option D mentions the inferior orbital fissure, which is not directly related to the oculomotor nerve's function.\n\nGiven this analysis, it seems that option A is incorrect, as the oculomotor nerve does carry parasympathetic fibers.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
