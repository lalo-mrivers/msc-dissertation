["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the enzyme deficiency that prevents vitamin C synthesis in humans. None of the provided documents explicitly state this information. However, we can infer from the documents that vitamin C is an essential nutrient that cannot be synthesized by humans. The document 'Nonscorbutic effects of vitamin C: biochemical aspects' suggests that tissue saturation with AA (ascorbic acid) provides a good insurance against defects in extra-antiscorbutic areas, implying that humans require vitamin C for proper functioning. The other documents do not provide direct information on the synthesis of vitamin C, but they describe the importance of vitamin C and its potential effects on various physiological processes.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
