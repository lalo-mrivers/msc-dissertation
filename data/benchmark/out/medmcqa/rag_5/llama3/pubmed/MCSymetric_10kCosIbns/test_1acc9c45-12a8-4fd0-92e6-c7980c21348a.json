["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents discuss the thermal sterilization of fluids, thermal inactivation of microorganisms, and thermostability of vaccines. The concept of 'thermostability' is discussed in multiple papers, including Evaluation of Thermostability of Lyophilized BCG Vaccines by Using an Accelerated Thermal Degradation Test and Stability of Cholera and Typhoid Vaccines. In these discussions, the sensitivity of vaccine due to heat is referred to as a decrease in potency or loss of viability over time at elevated temperatures. This suggests that the parameter used to determine the sensitivity of vaccine due to heat is related to the measurement of the loss of potency or viability.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
