["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To find the number of patients with blood pressures between the 3rd and 4th quartiles, I need to know the median value. The first quartile (Q1) is 94 mmHg and the third quartile (Q3) is 110 mmHg. This means that half of the patients have blood pressures below 110 mmHg and the other half have blood pressures above 94 mmHg.\n\nSince Q3 is 110 mmHg, I know that all patients with blood pressures above 110 mmHg are in the upper half of the distribution. To find the number of patients with blood pressures between the 3rd and 4th quartiles (i.e., between the median and the third quartile), I need to calculate the interquartile range (IQR).\n\nThe IQR is the difference between Q3 and Q1, which is 110 - 94 = 16 mmHg. To find the number of patients with blood pressures between the 3rd and 4th quartiles, I can use the rule that about 25% of the data points fall within one IQR from the median.\n\nSince I don't have the exact values for each patient, I'll assume a normal distribution (which is not necessary but simplifies the calculation). Then, about 12.5% of the patients would have blood pressures above Q3 and below the median. This means that approximately half of these patients would be in the range between Q3 and the median.\n\nSince there are 200 patients, I can estimate the number of patients with blood pressures between the 3rd and 4th quartiles as about 12.5% of 200, which is approximately 50.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
