["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about tooth structure cutting being preceded by crack propagation due to tensile forces. The relevant documents mention various types of fractures and cracks, but the key phrase is 'tensile forces'. Tensile stress is mentioned in the document 'Tensile stress in glass-ceramic crowns: effect of flaws and cement voids' as a cause of crown failure. Additionally, the document 'A simple model of crack propagation in dental restorations' discusses the importance of tensile stresses adjacent to cusp loading. Given this information, it is likely that tooth structure cutting is preceded by crack propagation due to tensile forces.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: All of the above\""]
