["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The key to understanding the function of a reciprocal clasp arm is to analyze the concept of intrinsic retention. According to the document 'Guiding planes in clasp reciprocation and retention', intrinsic retention refers to a guide plane opposed by an undercut at 180 degrees. This means that during engagement, the retentive arm will move towards the denture, causing the reciprocal arm to counteract this movement. Therefore, the function of the reciprocal clasp arm is to counteract the movement of the denture caused during engagement of the retentive arm.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
