["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question describes a 4-day-old breastfed term neonate with jaundice. The bilirubin level is 18 mg/dl. According to the documents, physiological jaundice is common in newborns, and most cases resolve spontaneously without treatment. The normal range of bilirubin is below 10 mg/100 ml, while 2.6% of newborn babies have maximum bilirubin levels above 16 mg/100 ml.
