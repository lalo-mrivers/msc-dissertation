["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to the provided documents, specifically [The development of strength in the masticatory muscles and its sensory control], it is mentioned that 'the pulp, especially its coronal portion, showed a dominating influence on the extent of the developed adduction force.' This suggests that the fibers involved in mastication are related to the adduction movement. Additionally, from [Analysis of the tendinous structure in human masticatory muscles], we can infer that the masticatory muscles have bundles of tendon composed of collagen and elastic fibers. In the masseter muscle, the property of the tendon differs compared to other masticatory muscles, which is related to the kinetic force for stress or stretch during jaw movement. This information points towards the importance of the adductor muscles in generating maximum masticatory forces.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
