["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Since the documents are discussing fillers for dental composites or resin applications, I am looking for information about alginate fillers. In one of the documents ('Production of alginate beads by emulsification/internal gelation'), it is mentioned that small diameter alginate beads (microspheres) were formed via internal gelation of alginate solution emulsified within vegetable oil. Gelation was initiated by addition of an oil-soluble acid thereby reducing the pH of the alginate solution and releasing soluble Ca2+ from the citrate complex. This suggests that calcium ions are involved in the formation of these beads, which are alginate fillers.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C\n}"]
