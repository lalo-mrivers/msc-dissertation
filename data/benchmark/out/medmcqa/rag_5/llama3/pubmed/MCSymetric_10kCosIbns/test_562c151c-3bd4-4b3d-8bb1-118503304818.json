["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the susceptibility of endodontically treated posterior teeth to fracture. The relevant documents describe different types of fractures, including obliquely directed complete fractures, vertically directed complete fractures, and others. However, there is no mention of endodontically treated teeth being more susceptible to fracture in any of these documents. Therefore, we need to look for other clues that might explain the answer. One possible factor could be the loss of moisture or coronal structure, which might make the tooth more prone to fracture. However, there is no direct evidence supporting this claim.\n\nThe only relevant information provided is from the article on root canal therapy, which discusses the diagnosis and treatment of pulp-involved teeth. There is no mention of fractures or susceptibility to fracture in this context.\n\nBased on the available information, it seems that the answer cannot be definitively determined. However, if we had to choose an option based on the provided documents, we might consider options A, C, or D, as they seem more plausible than B (hollow canals) given the context of endodontically treated posterior teeth.\n\nTherefore, I would recommend choosing one of these options (A, C, or D) without being able to definitively determine which one is correct based on the provided information.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
