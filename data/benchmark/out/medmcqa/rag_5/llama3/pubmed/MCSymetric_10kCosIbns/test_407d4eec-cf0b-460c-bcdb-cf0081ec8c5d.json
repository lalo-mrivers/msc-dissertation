["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the document 'Mechanism of methacholine-induced rise in intraocular pressure in the dog', it is mentioned that methacholine stimulation of ciliary muscle contraction with consequent thickening of the lens as responsible for its intraocular pressure-elevating effect. This suggests that methacholine acts on muscarinic receptors, specifically M3 receptor which is involved in contraction of smooth muscles including the ciliary muscle.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom the document 'Muscarinic cholinergic receptor modulation of beta-adrenergic receptor affinity for catecholamines', it is mentioned that methacholine antagonized the guanine nucleotide-induced reduction in beta-adrenergic receptor affinity for isoproterenol, and this effect was reversed by atropine. This suggests that methacholine acts on muscarinic receptors to modulate the effects of GTP.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom the document 'Methacholine: a 7-day inhalation toxicity study with primates', it does not provide any information about the receptor binding of methacholine.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom the document 'In vivo evaluation of airway and pulmonary tissue response to inhaled methacholine in the rat', it does not provide any information about the receptor binding of methacholine.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe document 'Relationship between nonspecific bronchial responsiveness to methacholine and peripheral mononuclear leukocyte beta-adrenergic receptor function in young drug-naive subjects' does not mention anything about methacholine's receptor binding.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
