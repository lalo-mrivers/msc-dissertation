["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The main issue is to determine the type of cells most commonly affected in glaucomatous optic atrophy. From the given documents, we can see that glaucoma cupping and optic nerve damage are related to loss of ganglion cell axonal fibers (document 1). Additionally, a clinicopathologic study on autosomal dominant optic atrophy suggests that this condition is characterized by primary degeneration of retinal ganglion cells (document 4). Furthermore, the morphological aspects of normal optic disc and early signs of glaucomatous alterations indicate that cupping might be caused by loss of ganglion cell axonal fibers. Given these findings, it seems reasonable to conclude that ganglion cells are most commonly affected in glaucomatous optic atrophy.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
