["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the 95th percentile of blood pressure above which 95% of people would have blood pressure, we need to know the mean and standard deviation. Given that the mean is 125 mm Hg with a standard deviation of 10, we can use the z-score formula to find the value corresponding to the 95th percentile.\n\nThe z-score for the 95th percentile can be calculated as follows:\n\nz = (x - μ) / σ\nwhere x is the unknown value, μ is the mean (125), and σ is the standard deviation (10).\n\nRearranging the formula to solve for x, we get:\n\nx = μ + z * σ\n\nWe need to find the value of z that corresponds to the 95th percentile. Since the 95th percentile represents 2.5% of the data points above the mean (since there are two tails, left and right), we can use a z-table or calculate the z-score.\n\nUsing a z-table or calculator, we find that the z-score for the 95th percentile is approximately 1.645.\n\nNow, substituting this value into the equation above:\n\nx = 125 + (1.645 * 10) = 135.45 mm Hg\n\nThis value represents the 95th percentile of blood pressure above which 95% of people would have blood pressure.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
