It's an effective way to manage the third stage of labor.\\n\\nOption C: Early cord clamping and cutting - Clamping or cutting the umbilical cord early can lead to increased blood pressure, which may cause PPH. We need to avoid this method.\\n\\nOption D: Prophylactic misoprostol - Misoprostol is a medication that helps prevent bleeding by stimulating uterine contractions. It's commonly used in medical settings to manage PPH.\\n\\nBased on our analysis, we can conclude that Option C: Early cord clamping and cutting is the exception.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
