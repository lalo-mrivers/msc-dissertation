["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the effects of various non-depolarizing muscle relaxants on skeletal muscles. Pancuronium is one such drug that has been studied for its neuromuscular effects and recovery time after injection. The documents do not mention Succinylcholine, Mivacurum or Decamethonium as being short-acting non-depolarizing muscle relaxants. Therefore, based on the available information, Pancuronium is the most likely candidate to be a short-acting non-depolarizing muscle relaxant.\", \"answer_choice\": B}"]
