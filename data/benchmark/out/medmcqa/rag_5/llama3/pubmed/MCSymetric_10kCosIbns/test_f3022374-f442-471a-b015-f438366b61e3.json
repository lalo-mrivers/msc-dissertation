["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe various forms of mercury toxicity, including elemental mercury vapor and organic methyl mercury. The Agency for Toxic Substance and Disease Registry notes that elemental mercury vapor accounts for most occupational and many accidental exposures, while the main source of organic methyl mercury exposure in the general population is fish consumption. Additionally, children are at increased risk of exposure to elemental mercury vapor in the home because it tends to settle to the floor. Based on this information, the greatest potential hazard of mercury toxicity likely occurs through inhalation of mercury vapours.\", \"answer_choice\": B}"]
