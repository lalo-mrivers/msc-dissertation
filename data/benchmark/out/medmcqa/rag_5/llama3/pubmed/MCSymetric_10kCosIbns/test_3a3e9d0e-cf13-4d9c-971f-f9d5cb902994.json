["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The provided documents describe the identification of a neutral lipid core in a transiently expressed and secreted lipoprotein containing an apoB-48-like apolipoprotein. The presence of this lipoprotein is demonstrated by measuring its densities before and after treatment with a bacterial lipase specific for neutral lipids. This suggests that the lipoprotein has a structure similar to naturally occurring lipoproteins, such as chylomicrons.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
