["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the adult stage of filarial worms responsible for diseases. We can identify the adult stages from the relevant documents. Brugia malayi is mentioned as a parasite that develops to maturity with the production of microfilaraemia and clinical manifestations in man, similar to those caused by periodic B. malayi in man. Similarly, Dirofilaria species are mentioned as causing pulmonary dirofilariasis and subcutaneous nodules in man. Onchocerca volvulus is also mentioned as a parasite that causes onchocerciasis. Mansonella ozzardi is not explicitly mentioned as causing disease in humans. Wuchereria bancrofti is a well-known filarial worm that causes lymphatic filariasis.
