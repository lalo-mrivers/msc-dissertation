["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the principal fibers of the Periodontal Ligament (PDL). The relevant documents describe different types of fibers. In 'Characterization of collagen fiber architecture in the canine diaphragmatic central tendon', it is mentioned that there are two distinct collagen fiber populations throughout the DCT, which suggests that PDL might also have predominantly collagenous fibers. In 'The three-dimensional ultrastructure of the collagen fibers, reticular fibers and elastic fibers: a review', it is stated that the Periodontal Ligament (PDL) consists mainly of collagen fibers, while reticular fibers are often interwoven with these collagen fibers. Based on this information, it can be concluded that the principal fibers of the PDL are likely to be collagenous.\", \"answer_choice\": C}"]
