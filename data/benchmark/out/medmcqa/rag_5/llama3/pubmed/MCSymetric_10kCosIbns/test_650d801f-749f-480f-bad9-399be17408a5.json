["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the ultrastructure of acinar cells in various glands, including the rat exorbital lacrimal gland. The Golgi apparatus is mentioned as participating in the transport of secretory proteins and being involved in the formation of secretory granules. There is no direct mention of the location of the Golgi apparatus in serous acinar cells. However, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) studies of dissociated pancreatic acinar cell surfaces show that zymogen droplets are found within the vesicles of the Golgi complex. This suggests that the Golgi apparatus may be apical or near the apical region, given its involvement in secretory granule formation and discharge.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B: Apical\""]
