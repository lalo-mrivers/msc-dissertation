["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking when it's imperative to take X-ray for root fracture. The relevant documents mention that high quality radiographs are important for the identification of occult fractures. It also mentions special views such as oblique films, tangential and axial views, and stress films. Since we're looking for a specific angle or set of angles for root fracture, let's compare the options to the mentioned special views. 90° and 110° are not mentioned in the documents, so they seem unlikely. 45° is mentioned as an oblique film view, which is relevant for delineating fractures. Therefore, we can deduce that 45° might be a crucial angle for root fracture X-ray. However, the combination of 45° and 90° also seems plausible given the context of special views.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: 45°,\t90°, 110°\"\n}"]
