["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the causes of Down syndrome, and we have several documents to refer to. The first document mentions Down syndrome with congenital heart malformation, which is caused by trisomy 21. This suggests that trisomy of 21 chromosome is a cause of Down syndrome. The second document reports on a patient with Down's syndrome and additional XYY aneuploidy, but does not contradict the idea that trisomy of 21 chromosome is a cause. The third document discusses autoimmunity in patients with Down's syndrome, without providing information about the cause of the condition. The fourth document presents mortality rates and life-tables for patients with Down's syndrome, which does not provide information about the causes of the condition. Finally, the fifth document provides hematological and biochemical studies on children with Down syndrome, but does not provide information about the causes of the condition. Therefore, we can conclude that trisomy of 21 chromosome is a cause of Down syndrome.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
