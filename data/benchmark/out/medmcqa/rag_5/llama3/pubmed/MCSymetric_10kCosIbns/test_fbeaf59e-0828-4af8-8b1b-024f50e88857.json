["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the movement involved in opening the mouth. In 'Mastication and swallowing: an overview', it is mentioned that during jaw opening, the antero-posterior movements of the tongue are much greater when eating soft food. This suggests that translation is a component of opening the mouth. Additionally, it is described as the pattern of jaw movement during closing and during opening varying with food consistency. The fact that the velocity of closing is suddenly reduced to produce two clearly different phases of closure implies that hinge (rotation) is also involved in opening the mouth. Therefore, we can conclude that both translation and hinge movements are involved in opening the mouth.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
