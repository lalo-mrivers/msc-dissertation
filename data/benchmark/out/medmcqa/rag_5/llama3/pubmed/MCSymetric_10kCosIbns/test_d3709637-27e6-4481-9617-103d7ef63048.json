["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the outcome of a parent who is homozygous (i.e., has two copies) for an autosomal recessive gene, while another parent is heterozygous (i.e., has one copy). Since the gene is recessive, it means that the dominant allele will mask its expression. Therefore, the offspring will only inherit the recessive allele if they receive two copies from their parents, which would be one copy each from both parents. Given that one parent is homozygous for the recessive allele and the other parent is heterozygous, there is no chance of any offspring receiving two copies of the dominant allele, so all children will be carriers of the recessive allele but not affected themselves.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
