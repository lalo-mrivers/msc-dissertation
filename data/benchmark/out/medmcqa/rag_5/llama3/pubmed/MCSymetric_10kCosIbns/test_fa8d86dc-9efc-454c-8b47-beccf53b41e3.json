["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks for reasons why custom trays might be better than stock trays for impression of crowns. The relevant documents provide information on the accuracy of different types of trays and castability of crown margins. One study compared the accuracy in three dimensions of casts made from complete-arch custom acrylic resin trays and two types of dual-arch impression trays, finding that the dual-arch trays were at least as accurate as the custom tray in every dimension measured. Another study found that the shortness of margins was observed in all of the casted samples with stock margins, whereas custom trays would allow for more precise evaluation of marginal castability. However, there is no information on the cost or ease of adaptation of custom trays compared to stock trays. Therefore, options C and A can be eliminated as incorrect answers.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
