["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, we need to understand that the positive predictive value of a screening test is related to its sensitivity, specificity, and disease prevalence. We are given the disease prevalence as 20% (1/5). The sensitivity of the test is 95%, which means that out of all people who actually have the disease, 95% will test positive. The specificity of the test is 80%, which means that out of all people who do not have the disease, 80% will test negative. To calculate the positive predictive value, we need to multiply the probability of having the disease given a positive test result by the prevalence of the disease.\n\nWe can use Bayes' theorem to find this probability: P(D|+) = P(+|D) \\* P(D) / (P(+|D) \\* P(D) + P(-|D) \\* P(-)).\n\nFirst, we need to calculate P(+|D), which is the sensitivity of 95%. So, out of all people who have the disease, 95% will test positive. This means that the probability of a positive test result given that someone has the disease is 0.95 or 95%.\n\nNext, we need to calculate P(-|D), which is the complement of the sensitivity (1 - 0.95) = 0.05. So, out of all people who have the disease, 5% will test negative.\n\nNow we can use Bayes' theorem: P(D|+) = 0.95 \\* 0.2 / (0.95 \\* 0.2 + 0.05 \\* 0.8) = 0.473.\n\nThis is the probability of having the disease given a positive test result, which is approximately 47.3%.\n\nFinally, we can multiply this by the prevalence of the disease to get the positive predictive value: P(D|+) \\* 0.2 = 0.0946 or 9.46%.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C: 15.30%\""]
