["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about negative rake angle. In the provided documents, we can find information about forearm angles and radiographs. Specifically, in the document 'Radiographic measurements of the radio-carpal joint in normal adults', there is a mention of the inclination of the distal joint surface of the radius. This seems to be related to the concept of rake angle. The document also discusses postero-anterior and lateral projections, which could provide more context about the measurement technique. Furthermore, we can refer to the 'Perception of forearm angles in 3-dimensional space' study, which provides information about the accuracy of perceiving different types of angles, including elevation and yaw angles. By analyzing these documents, we can infer that negative rake angle refers to a situation where the rake face is behind the radial line.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C\n}"]
