["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about a drug that acts on the dilator pupillae, which is responsible for pupil dilation. Pilocarpine, on the other hand, acts on the sphincter papillae, which is responsible for pupil constriction. We need to find a drug that has an action analogous to pilocarpine's effect on the sphincter papillae, which means it should constrict the dilator pupillae. Tropicamide is a drug that also acts on the sphincter papillae and causes pupil constriction.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
