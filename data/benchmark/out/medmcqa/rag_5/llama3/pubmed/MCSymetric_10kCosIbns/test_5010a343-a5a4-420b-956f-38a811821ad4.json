["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The provided documents discuss various statistical topics such as the independent samples t-test, k-ratio t-tests for multiple comparisons, the effect of screening on test variances, and short tests in psychopathology. None of these discussions explicitly address the condition required for a valid student-t test between means of two groups. However, considering the concept of normality or non-normality, we can infer that the correct answer is related to the assumption of equal variance. This is because many statistical tests, including the t-test, require this assumption.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B: Standard deviation must be approximately same\""]
