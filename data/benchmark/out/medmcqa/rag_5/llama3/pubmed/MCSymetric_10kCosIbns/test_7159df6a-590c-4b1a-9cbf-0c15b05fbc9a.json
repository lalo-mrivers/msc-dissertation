["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about primary trauma from occlusion. The relevant documents provided are case reports on thrombosis of the cerebral vessels following closed cranial trauma, internal carotid artery occlusion due to intraoral trauma, multiple facial trauma complicated by occlusion of the internal carotid artery, and vascular trauma. From these documents, it can be inferred that occlusion-related injury is a possible cause of blood vessel damage, particularly in the context of facial trauma. Therefore, option B: Adaptive capacity of tissues to withstand occlusal forces is impaired resulting in injury from normal occlusal forces is the most relevant answer.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
