["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the tooth with a buccal surface made of 2 lobes. The relevant document is [The lateral dental lamina and the enamel niche]. According to this document, the lateral enamel strand gradually becomes smaller in regard to the tooth germ, changing its relative position to the mesial half of the latter, and finally degenerates. In the molar germ, as the epithelial tongue-like projection at the cap-stage increases in length to become an interradical process, the lateral enamel strand extends as a crest on the buccal interradical process. The direction of the lateral enamel strand is inverse in the maxillary molar germs.\n\nThis suggests that the maxillary first molar has a buccal surface made of 2 lobes due to the presence of this lateral enamel strand.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
