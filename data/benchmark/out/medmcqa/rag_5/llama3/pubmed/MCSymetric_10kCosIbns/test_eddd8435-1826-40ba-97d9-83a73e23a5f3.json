["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"All the given documents are related to heterocyclic compounds and their bioactivities. The question asks for a drug that does not belong to the amide group. None of the provided documents mention these specific anesthetics (procaine, xylocaine, lignocaine, bupivacaine) or their relation to amidase activity. Amidase activity is related to the hydrolysis of internal amides and vinyl-bound amides, whereas the given anesthetics are aminoamide-based local anesthetics. Therefore, it can be concluded that none of these anesthetics belong to the amide group.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
