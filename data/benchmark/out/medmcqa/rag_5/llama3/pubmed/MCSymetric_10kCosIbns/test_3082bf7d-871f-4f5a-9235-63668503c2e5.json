["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the stapedius muscle reflex and its modifications under various conditions. The oscilloscopic analysis of the reflex reveals changes in latency, amplitude, and speed of onset, particularly in brain stem lesions. This suggests that the control center for the stapedial reflex is located at the brain stem level. Specifically, the documents mention modifications of the reflex during pathological and experimental impairment of the intermediate portion of the arc, at the brain stem level. Therefore, the answer can be inferred by considering the location of the brain stem.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
