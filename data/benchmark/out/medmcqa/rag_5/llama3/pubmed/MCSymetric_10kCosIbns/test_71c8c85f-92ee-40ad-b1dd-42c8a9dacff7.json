["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking what is true about cardiolipin except the options provided. The first relevant document discusses antigen mobility in membranes and complement-mediated immune attack, but it does not specifically mention the molecular structure or properties of cardiolipin. The second document describes a method for analyzing cardiolipin molecular species by high-performance liquid chromatography, but this information is also not directly related to the question. The third document discusses turnover of fatty acids in rat liver cardiolipin and compares it with other mitochondrial phospholipids, but again this does not provide direct information about cardiolipin's structure or properties. The fourth document describes solubilization, purification, and characterization of cardiolipin synthase from rat liver mitochondria, which provides some information about cardiolipin's role in its own biosynthesis. However, none of these documents mention the specific options provided as choices.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
