["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the direction of compression when forces are applied on the lateral surface at an angle region. The relevant documents describe biomechanical aspects of osteosynthesis with plates and screws. In the document [Experimental examinations in plate-prebending--a contribution to the biomechanics of compression osteosynthesis (author's transl)], it is mentioned that asymmetric positioning of the plate on bone-shaft causes a torque effect when strain is applied, bringing about distraction of the cortex on the side opposite the plate. This suggests that forces applied at an angle region could cause tension or distraction on one side and compression on the other.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
