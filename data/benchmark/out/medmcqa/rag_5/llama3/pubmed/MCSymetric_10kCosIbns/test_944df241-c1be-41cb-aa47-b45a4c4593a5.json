["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the provided documents, it is clear that ions can be incorporated into the enamel surface. This is demonstrated by the study on the effects of inorganic ions situated at the enamel surface on the adsorption and activity of acid phosphatase. The study shows that the affinity of the enamel surface for a biologically active protein may be modified by first impregnating the mineral with particular inorganic ions. Additionally, the diffusion phenomena during artificial carious lesion formation demonstrate that unionized species such as HL and CaHPO4 diffuse into the enamel. This suggests that ionic exchange between the enamel surface and environment is possible. Furthermore, the study on adhesive bonding of various materials to hard tooth tissues highlights the role of certain cations in being sorbed by enamel from an acid etching solution. These findings collectively indicate that ionic exchange between the enamel surface and environment does not stop after a specific age or time.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: Continues throughout life\"\n}"]
