["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks which teeth are least involved in periodontitis. We need to analyze the relevant documents to find an answer. The first document talks about clinical periodontal parameters and roentgenographic diagnosis of periodontitis. It mentions that a temporary treatment plan is made, but it does not provide information on specific tooth involvement. The second document discusses juvenile periodontitis and its localization in relation to age, sex, and teeth affected. It defines three types of bone loss localization: I (first molars and/or incisors), II (first molars, incisors, and some additional teeth), and III (general involvement). The distribution of bone loss is analyzed according to age group and tooth type. We can see that the frequency of type I bone loss decreases with age, while type III increases. Maxillary teeth are involved slightly more than mandibular teeth, and there is a 'mirror effect' between right and left jaw halves. The third document talks about histologic studies on periodontitis extension into the alveolar process, which suggests that the disease can be much more widespread than previously thought. Finally, the last document discusses prevalence of chronic periodontitis in 13-15-year-old children, but it does not provide specific information on tooth involvement.\n\nBased on these documents, we can infer that lower incisors and upper molars are less involved in periodontitis.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: Lower incisors and upper molars\""]
