According to this study, both carbohydrates and proteins produced an initial enhanced thermogenesis. However, the study also suggests that the palatability of the food is responsible for the early cephalic increase in postprandial thermogenesis, and for the insulin and norepinephrine release. Therefore, we can conclude that the maximum thermic effect of food is not solely dependent on macronutrients.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
