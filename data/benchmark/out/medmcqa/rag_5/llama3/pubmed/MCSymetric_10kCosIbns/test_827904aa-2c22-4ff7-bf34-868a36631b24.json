["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the provided documents, we can infer that Reed-Sternberg cells are derived from B-cells. The initial document states that cytochemical, ultrastructural and immunological studies of circulating Reed-Sternberg cells show them to be of B-cell lineage. Additionally, one of the documents mentions that immunoglobulin components have been demonstrated within Reed-Sternberg cell in Hodgkin's disease using immunoperoxidase techniques, which further supports a B-lymphocytic origin for the Reed-Sternberg cell.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
