["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the relevant documents, I can infer that the facial skeleton is divided into meridians numbered from 0 to 7 and from 8 to 14. The nasal bone is part of the median facial structures, as mentioned in [Bone clefts of the median facial structures. An anatomical study]. This suggests that the nasal bone might be paired. On the other hand, the vomer is also part of the nasal complex and is often described as an unpaired bone. Therefore, I can conclude that the correct answer is likely to be either C (Inferior nasal concha) or D (Vomer).\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
