["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, it can be seen that preparation of the pulp chamber is essential for a good access to the root canal. However, none of the documents explicitly mention the point used as termination of Root canal procedure. A close look at [Length measurement of the root canal] reveals that there are no absolutely accurate methods to measure the length of the root canal in vivo because of specific anatomic conditions and error inherent in all methods. Furthermore, [Canal obturation. Analysis of 4 different techniques] discusses the various techniques used for root canal filling, but does not explicitly state the point used as termination of Root canal procedure. Therefore, we need to look at [The wall of the root canal after treatment with various instruments], which states that the root canal walls must be freed of soft-tissue remnants and smoothed, and the orifices of the dental tubules blocked. This suggests that the apical constriction might be a point used as termination of Root canal procedure, as it requires careful cleaning and shaping to prevent any remaining bacteria from spreading and causing further infection.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
