["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the provided documents, it is evident that peripheral nerve fibers have different membrane properties correlated with their size. Smaller fibres have a lower conduction velocity than would be expected if their membrane properties were identical with those of larger size. This suggests that the diameter of the nerve fiber affects its conduction velocity.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
