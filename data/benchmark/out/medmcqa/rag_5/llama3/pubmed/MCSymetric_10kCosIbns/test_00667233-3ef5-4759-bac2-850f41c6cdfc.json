["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the minimum number of lobes required to form a tooth. The documents provided are related to dental embryology, cilia in dentinal pulp, disposition of apices of roots, functional tooth axes, and adaptations of primate molar teeth. After reviewing these documents, we can conclude that the information provided does not directly address the formation of a tooth or the number of lobes required. However, one document talks about the development of human teeth, which mentions the lateral enamel strand and its degeneration. This implies that the process of tooth formation involves complex morphological changes, but it does not provide a direct answer to the question.\n\nTherefore, we will focus on the documents that describe the structure and function of primate molar teeth. The document 'The functional adaptations of primate molar teeth' provides measurements taken on upper and lower molars of 37 species of primates and one tupaiid. It also describes significant correlations between pairs of allometrically standardized dimensions which measure the same molar function.\n\nBased on this information, we can infer that the structure and function of primate molar teeth are complex and involve multiple aspects such as shearing, crushing, and grinding features. This implies that a tooth requires a minimum of 3 lobes or cusps to perform these functions effectively.\", \n\"answer_choice\": C"]
