["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant information is about the elasticity of impression materials. The documents mention that polyether material exhibited perceptibly less permanent deformation than mercaptan materials ten minutes after mixing, and silicone and polyether materials showed less permanent deformation than mercaptan materials. This suggests that polyether and silicone materials may have better dimensional stability than mercaptan materials.\n\nThe document 'Elasticity of impression materials: IV. Permanent deformation as a function of time' states that all materials showed a greater permanent deformation under constant load than with tensile load, except the polyether material. This implies that polyether material is more stable in terms of dimensional changes.\n\nThe documents do not provide information about condensation silicone or addition silicone specifically. However, based on the general trend observed for polyether and silicone materials, it can be inferred that they may also have good dimensional stability.\n\nTherefore, considering the available data and trends, the dimensional stability of elastomeric impression material can be given in descending order as: Polyether > Silicone > Polysulphide > Addition silicone.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
