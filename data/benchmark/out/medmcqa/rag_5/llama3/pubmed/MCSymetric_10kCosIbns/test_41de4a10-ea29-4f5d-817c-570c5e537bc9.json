["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the best method to know the position and integrity of ICD. The relevant documents discuss various aspects of implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs) such as different ways of application, superiority of endocardial versus epicardial implantation, continuing experience with automatic implantable cardioverter-defibrillator, and issues related to inappropriate discharges by the ICD. None of these discussions mention CECT, MRI, or USG as methods for assessing ICD position and integrity. Therefore, the most relevant information is found in the discussion on intraoperative assessment where it is mentioned that all ICDs should be interrogated using a standard programmer during routine testing with the unit in 'defibrillation on' mode. This suggests that plain radiographs may be used to assess the position and integrity of the ICD.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
