["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents highlight Prinzmetal's angina as a coronary ischemic syndrome characterized by spontaneous or induced coronary spasm. The anatomic aspects of Prinzmetal's angina suggest that the lesions can be very moderate, and the pathogenesis is discussed. In [Clinical and angiographic study and pathogenic mechanism of Prinzmetal's angina], it is mentioned that most patients with normal or nearly normal coronary arteries had normal ECGs between attacks. Exercise electrocardiography reproduced ST elevation in 4 out of 9 patients but never ST depression. Spontaneous or induced coronary spasm were observed in 27 patients, confirming its role as the mechanism of Prinzmetal angina, whatever the anatomical appearance of the coronary tree.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
