["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Glucagon plays a role in regulating plasma lipid concentrations by stimulating lipolysis at the adipocyte. Lipolysis is the breakdown of triglycerides into nonesterified fatty acids (NEFAs) and glycerol. The text highlights glucagon's ability to stimulate the release of NEFAs from fat cells, which can then be used for energy metabolism or converted to ketone bodies in the liver. This process is regulated by lipase enzymes. Hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) is a key enzyme involved in lipolysis and is controlled by glucagon.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
