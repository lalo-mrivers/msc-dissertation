["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about a circulating antibody directed to intercellular cementing substance of stratified squamous epithelium. In the provided documents, it is mentioned that patients with advanced squamous cell carcinomas were shown to have serum antibodies directed towards cultured squamous tumor cells as shown by quantitative membrane immunofluorescence. This suggests that there are circulating antibodies in these patients. The antibody reactive fraction was recovered solely in the 19 S fraction, suggesting immunoglobulin M as the immunoglobulin isotype involved. Identification of the squamous tumor cell-reactive immunoglobulin as immunoglobulin M was confirmed by quantitative immunofluorescence with the use of class monospecific antisera to human immunoglobulins.\n\nFurther analysis shows that the sera of patients with squamous carcinoma did not react with a variety of other cultured tumor cells, suggesting that these antibodies are specific to squamous cell carcinomas. This information suggests that the disorder being described is likely related to squamous cell carcinoma, as it involves circulating antibodies directed towards intercellular cementing substance of stratified squamous epithelium.\n\nThe provided documents also mention that immunofluorescence (IF) techniques on cryostat-cut sections of tumor tissues demonstrated that immunoglobulin was associated with cells of squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck. This further supports the idea that the disorder being described is related to squamous cell carcinoma.\n\nGiven this information, it seems likely that the disorder being described is a type of cancer, specifically squamous cell carcinoma. The question asks about a circulating antibody directed to intercellular cementing substance of stratified squamous epithelium, which is consistent with the findings in the provided documents.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: Pemphigus vulgaris\""]
