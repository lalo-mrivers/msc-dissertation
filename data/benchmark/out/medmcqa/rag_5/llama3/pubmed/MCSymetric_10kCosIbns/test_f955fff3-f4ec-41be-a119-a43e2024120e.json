["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about what is FALSE about the innervation of the parotid gland. We can look at the documents for information about the parotid gland's innervation. The first document talks about scanning evaluation of parotid gland after tympanic neurectomy, but it doesn't mention anything specific about the types of fibers or nerves that innervate the parotid gland. The second document discusses the immunohistochemical localisation of substance P in human parotid gland and suggests that some of the SP-immunoreactive elements are unmyelinated and thinly myelinated small diameter (A delta and C) fibres, which are regarded as the peripheral receptors for nociceptive information. The third document discusses the effects of neurectomy of the tympanic plexus on secretion of the parotid gland in man and mentions that both divisions of the autonomic nerves evoke secretion and probably also motor effects in this gland. Based on this information, we can conclude that postganglionic parasympathetic fibre secretomotor is a correct statement about the innervation of the parotid gland.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
