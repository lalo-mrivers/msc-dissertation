["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe various anatomical structures and relationships in the leg. The question asks about a compartment without neurovascular bundle. From the anatomic study of skin island flaps supplied by the vascular axis of the sensitive superficial nerves, we can infer that these nerves are associated with arteries or interlacing networks that ensure the vascularization of the nerves. This suggests that the neurovascular bundles are located superficially or suprafascially. Based on this information and the provided document about communicating veins, it is unlikely to find a compartment without neurovascular bundle in the leg. Therefore, we must examine the other anatomical structures described in the documents.\", \n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
