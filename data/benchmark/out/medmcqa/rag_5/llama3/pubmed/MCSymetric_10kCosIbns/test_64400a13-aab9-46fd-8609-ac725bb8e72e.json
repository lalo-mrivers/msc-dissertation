["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the documents provided, we know that hypersomatotropism (excessive growth hormone) is accompanied by a significant increase in GFR. Therefore, we are looking for factors that decrease GFR. Renal stone in ureter (C) does not directly affect GFR, and decreased oncotic pressure (D) also does not directly impact GFR. Increased renal blood flow (A) can increase GFR, and efferent aeriole constriction (B) can decrease GFR. Therefore, the correct answer is B: Efferent aeriole constriction.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
