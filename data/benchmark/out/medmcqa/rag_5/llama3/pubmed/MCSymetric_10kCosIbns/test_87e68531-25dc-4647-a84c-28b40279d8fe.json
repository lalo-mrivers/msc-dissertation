["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question states that an affected male does not have affected children but an affected female always has affected children. This suggests that the inheritance is linked to gender. X-linked recessive inheritance means that males are more likely to be affected because they only need to inherit one copy of the gene, while females need to inherit two copies (one from each parent) to express the trait. Since affected females always have affected children, this also implies that the mothers of these children are carriers, inheriting one copy of the recessive gene and passing it on to their offspring. In contrast, males who inherit only one copy of the gene will not be affected themselves but can pass the gene on to their daughters if they have them. This fits with the X-linked recessive inheritance pattern.\",\n\"answer_choice\": A"]
