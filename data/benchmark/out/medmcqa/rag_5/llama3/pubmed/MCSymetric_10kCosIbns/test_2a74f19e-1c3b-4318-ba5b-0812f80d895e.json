["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The provided documents discuss randomization as a method to reduce confounding (Allocation of patients to treatment in clinical trials), ensure comparability of two groups (Randomized clinical trials. Perspectives on some recent ideas), and decrease selection bias ([(Informed consent in clinical trials and its impact on methods of randomization and statistical evaluation)]). The document 'Impact of random assignment on study outcome: an empirical examination' even suggests that the trial results do not vary across therapeutic trials using random assignment versus those using nonrandom allocation of subjects. Therefore, it can be inferred that randomization does indeed reduce confounding, decrease selection bias, and ensure comparability of two groups.\n\nOn the other hand, increasing external validity is not directly related to randomization in a clinical trial. The document 'A new design for randomized clinical trials' suggests that patients will know whether an experimental treatment is to be used before providing consent, which increases transparency but does not necessarily increase external validity.\n\nTherefore, it can be concluded that D: Increases external validity of the trial is not true about randomization in a clinical trial.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
