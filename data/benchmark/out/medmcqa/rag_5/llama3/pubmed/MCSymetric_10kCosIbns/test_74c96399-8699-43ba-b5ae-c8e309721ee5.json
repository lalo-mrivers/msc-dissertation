["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, acromegaly is characterized by a range of symptoms. The first document highlights the correlation between clinical picture and glucose load response in patients with acromegaly. The second document shows that central hemodynamics are changed in patients with active-stage acromegaly. The third document emphasizes nonclassic features of acromegaly, including somatic disfigurement and mental/emotional dysfunction. The fourth document studies the microcirculation and cardiac function in acromegalic patients. Finally, the fifth document shows evidence of subclinical heart muscle dysfunction in acromegalic patients.\n\nConsidering these documents, large tongue is not specifically mentioned as a feature of acromegaly. However, somatic disfigurement is discussed in the third document, which could include changes to the tongue. Micrognathia is not mentioned at all. Hypoglycemia is not relevant to acromegaly based on the glucose load response discussed in the first document.\n\nThe only option that seems plausible is 'Large Tongue', as it is a possible aspect of somatic disfigurement.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
