["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the adverse effects of Escitalopram. We can look at the provided documents to find information about the adverse effects of Citalopram, which is the active ingredient in Escitalopram. The document 'Citalopram in depression--meta-analysis of intended and unintended effects' mentions that citalopram has fewer side-effects than tricyclics, especially of anticholinergic types. However, it does not specifically mention nausea, vivid dreams, anorgasmia or sialorrhoea as adverse effects.\n\nThe document 'Treatment of resistant depression with the citalopram-lithium combination' mentions that patients were submitted to a clinical assessment including side effects scales (UKU) during the treatment. However, it does not provide specific information about the types of side effects observed.\n\nThe document 'Evaluation of side effects and complications during the treatment of affective psychoses with thymoleptics' mentions that antidepressants independently from their pharmacological profile cause in above 50% of patients side effects mainly from autonomous nervous system. However, it does not provide specific information about the types of side effects observed.\n\nThe document 'The pharmacological effect of citalopram residues in the (S)-(+)-enantiomer' and 'Hepatotoxicity of citalopram in rats and first-pass metabolism' do not provide any information about adverse effects of Citalopram.\n\nBased on this information, we can conclude that none of the options provided are specifically mentioned as adverse effects of Citalopram.
