["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the provided documents, it can be seen that the condyle path is characterized by neuromuscular coordination. The document '[Protrusive condyle path in edentulous patients]' explains that the shape of protrusive condyle path was like a section of parabola curved forward and downward, indicating that the forward movement of the condyle is not solely due to bony or ligamental guidance, but rather neuromuscular coordination. This suggests that muscles play a role in controlling the movement of the condyle.\n\nThe document '[Radiocinematic comparison of the movement of the temporomandibular joint in the same patient with total prosthesis after various jaw relation recordings]' also implies that muscles are involved in the movement of the condyle, as it describes the 'active' condyle moving on a straight line towards the front and downward during laterotrusion.\n\nConsidering these findings, we can conclude that one or more muscles must be responsible for the forward movement of the condyle. Among the options provided (A: Masseter, B: Temporalis, C: Medial pterygoid, D: Lateral pterygoid), only lateral pterygoid muscle is known to play a role in moving the mandible forward and downward.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
