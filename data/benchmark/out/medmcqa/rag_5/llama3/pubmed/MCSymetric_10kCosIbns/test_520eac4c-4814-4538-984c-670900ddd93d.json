["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 5-year-old child with brown-colored urine and oliguria since 3 days, along with mild facial puffiness and pedal edema. The urine examination shows RBCs (100/hpf) and granular casts, indicating hematuria and proteinuria. With 3+ proteinuria, BP 126/90, the patient's presentation suggests a possible glomerular disease. Given the presence of RBCs in the urine sediment, membranous glomerulonephritis is unlikely as it typically presents with subnephrotic proteinuria (<3g/day). FSGS (Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis) and IgA nephropathy are both possible diagnoses considering the patient's age and presenting features. Minimal change disease is less likely due to the presence of RBCs in the urine sediment, as it typically presents with isolated proteinuria without hematuria.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
