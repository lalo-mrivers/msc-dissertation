["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about features of non-paralytic polio. We need to look for information that contradicts this condition. Upon reviewing the documents, we find that paralytic poliomyelitis is characterized by paralysis, whereas non-paralytic polio refers to cases without paralysis. Therefore, we should focus on symptoms or signs that are typically associated with paralytic polio. The answer choices provide some of these features. We can eliminate option A as absent deep tendon reflexes is not a unique feature of paralytic polio, but rather a common finding in many neurological conditions. Options B and C are more specific to paralytic polio, while option D could be present in both paralytic and non-paralytic cases. Therefore, the answer should include features that are typical of paralytic polio.\", \"answer_choice\": B}"]
