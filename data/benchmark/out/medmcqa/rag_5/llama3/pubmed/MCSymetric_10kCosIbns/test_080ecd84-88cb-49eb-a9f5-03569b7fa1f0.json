["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question describes episodes of repeated thin stools with mucus, subjective feeling of fever, and lower abdominal pain, with leukocytes in stool. From the provided documents, we can see that patients with E. coli 0119 showed fecal leukocytes of polymorphonuclear predominance. Patients with non-thyphoid salmonellosis also showed fecal leukocytes of polymorphonuclear predominance. In contrast, patients with septicemia from salmonella or other enterobacteria had a striking increase in percentage of mononuclears. Since the patient has polymorphonuclear leukocytes in their stool, it is likely that they have E. coli 0119 infection.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
