["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the timing of chickenpox infection in a mother that poses the most danger to the baby. None of the relevant documents provide direct information on this specific scenario. However, we can infer from the 'Chickenpox--a disease predominantly affecting adults in rural West Bengal, India' document that chickenpox is more prevalent among adults over 15 years old, with a mean age at which infection takes place being 23.4 years. This suggests that the risk of transmission to babies is lower if the mother gets infected when she's older.
