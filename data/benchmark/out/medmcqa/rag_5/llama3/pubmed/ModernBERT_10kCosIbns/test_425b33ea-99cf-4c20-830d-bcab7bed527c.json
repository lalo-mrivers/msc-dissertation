["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, it is clear that myocardial infarction (MI) leads to changes in various enzymes. From the document 'Effects of well-defined ischemia on myocardial lysosomal and microsomal enzymes', we see that lysosomal enzymatic activity was significantly decreased in L-ischemic areas, while from the document '[Glycoprotein changes in acute myocardial infarction]', we know that IgM proteins are significantly augmented during the first month after MI. This suggests an inflammatory response. Furthermore, from the document 'Mitochondrial structure and function in acute myocardial ischemic injury', we see that severe ischemia leads to structural changes and functional defects in mitochondria. Considering these findings, it is likely that enzymes elevated in plasma during MI could include those involved in mitochondrial metabolism or markers of tissue damage. CPK-MB, SGOT (AST), and LDH are all well-known markers of cardiac injury and are often elevated in the plasma following an MI.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
