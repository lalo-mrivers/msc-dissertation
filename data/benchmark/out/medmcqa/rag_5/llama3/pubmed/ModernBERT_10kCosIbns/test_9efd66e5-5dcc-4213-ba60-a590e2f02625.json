["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The provided documents describe different topics such as the Ilizarov technique for limb deformities, treatment of chronic joint malposition, mechanics of knee and prosthesis design, effect of functional appliances on skeletal pattern, and elements of a general theory of joints. Among these documents, there is no information specifically related to functional appliances in skeletal class II or orthodontic problems. Therefore, the answer cannot be found within these provided documents. However, based on general knowledge of orthodontics and dental literature, it can be concluded that functional appliances are used to correct dentofacial deformities and guide jaw growth. Skeletal class II is a type of malocclusion where the lower jaw (mandible) protrudes forward relative to the upper jaw (maxilla). Functional appliances in skeletal class II are indicated when the maxilla is retrognathic and mandible is prognathic, or vice versa.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
