["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks to identify the least likely cause of episodic anaemia and jaundice since birth in a 5-year-old male child. The options are: hereditary spherocytosis, sickle cell anemia, PNH, and G-6-PD deficiency. Based on the age of presentation, it is unlikely that the child has G-6-PD deficiency as it typically presents at birth or in early infancy. Sickle cell anemia also tends to present earlier in childhood. Hereditary spherocytosis can present at any age. PNH is a rare condition that usually presents with hemolytic anemia and jaundice, but it can occur at any age including childhood. Considering the options, PNH seems the least likely cause of episodic anaemia and jaundice since birth in this child.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
