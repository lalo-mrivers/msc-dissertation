["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the working time of impression material. The relevant documents describe various properties of impression materials, such as elasticity at set, permanent deformation, dimensional change on setting, and long-term stability. However, none of these descriptions mention the working time of the impression material. A review of modern impression materials mentions that the working time was determined for several of the impression materials tested. Therefore, I will look for information about this in the document. In a different section, the authors describe an investigation into assessment of tissue conditioning materials for functional impressions. They mention that they observed the effect of three important factors on the accuracy of the impressions, including thickness of the impression material and time of compression of the impression. This suggests that there is some information about the working time of the impression material in this document. Finally, I will look at a specific section about new elastic impression materials developed over the past few years. This section describes various properties of these materials, including their working time.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
