["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant information is from the papers discussing DNA ligase in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The paper 'The DNA repair capability of cdc9...' states that the mutant cdc9 is defective in DNA ligase and deficient in the repair of DNA damaged by methyl methane sulphonate. This suggests that DNA ligase plays a role in non-homologous end repair, as it repairs single-strand breaks. The paper 'Evidence that a single DNA ligase...' also supports this conclusion, stating that the same DNA ligase is involved in DNA replication and recombination.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
