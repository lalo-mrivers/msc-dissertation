["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the factors that affect the resolving power of a microscope. The relevant documents provide information about electron microscopes, transmission electron microscopes, scanning microdensitometry, and microscopy. From these texts, we can identify the key components of a microscope that affect its resolving power: objective lens, eyepiece, and aperture. The focal length of the eyepiece is not mentioned as a direct factor in the resolution of the microscope. Therefore, it is unlikely to be a significant factor.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
