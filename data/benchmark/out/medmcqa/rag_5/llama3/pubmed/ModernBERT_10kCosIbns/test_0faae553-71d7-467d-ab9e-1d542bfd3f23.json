["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the AO system of fixation when adequate bone buttressing is present. The AO system refers to a type of internal fixator plate used in fracture treatment. From the provided documents, we can infer that the AO compression plate or KÃ¼ntscher type medullary nail are mentioned as examples of internal fixations. In the document 'Bending mechanics of bone grafts: an experimental study', it is stated that a rigid plate fixation greatly affects the bone strength. This suggests that the AO system may be using load-bearing or load-sharing fixation principles to achieve adequate buttressing.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
