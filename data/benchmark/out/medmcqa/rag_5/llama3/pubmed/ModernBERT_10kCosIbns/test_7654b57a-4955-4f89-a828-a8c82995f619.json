["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the sequence of fractures on the petrous pa of temporal bone. Upon reviewing the relevant documents, I did not find any information that specifically relates to the sequence of fractures on this particular area. However, I found a document that discusses fractures of the skull [Evolutive fractures of the skull]. This document mentions Puppe's rule, which is a rule used to determine the sequence of skull fractures. Although it is not explicitly stated in the context of the question, I believe that Puppe's rule might be applicable in this case. Therefore, I will choose an answer based on this assumption.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
