["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the preferred method of intubation for a patient with oral & maxillofacial trauma, where cervical injury cannot be ruled out. The relevant documents highlight the importance of avoiding unstable cervical fractures during airway management. Therefore, it is crucial to consider the potential risks and benefits of different methods of intubation.\n\nNormal laryngoscopy and endotracheal intubation (C) could potentially exacerbate an unstable cervical fracture, whereas fiberoptic intubation (D) may be a safer option. The Combitube (B) is not mentioned in the relevant documents as a recommended method for managing airways in patients with cervical spine injuries.\n\nThe LMA (A) is not specifically discussed in the context of cervical spine injuries, but it could be considered as an alternative to traditional intubation methods.\n\nBased on these considerations, the preferred method of intubation would be fiberoptic intubation (D), which may minimize the risk of exacerbating a potential unstable cervical fracture.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
