["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the given documents, we can see that the thermic behavior of dental enamel, dentin, and selected dental materials is studied. The coefficient of expansion of these materials is estimated. Among the given options, phosphate glass is mentioned as a material with good correlation to hard dental texture. This suggests that phosphate glass has a similar coefficient of thermal expansion to tooth. Therefore, we can infer that phosphate glass is not among the available options.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"None\"\n}"]
