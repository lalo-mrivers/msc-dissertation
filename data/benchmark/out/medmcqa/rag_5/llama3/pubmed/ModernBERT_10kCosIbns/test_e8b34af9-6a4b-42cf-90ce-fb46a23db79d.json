["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents discuss transient tachypnea of the newborn (TTN). The first document describes infants with cyanosis due to persistence of fetal cardiopulmonary circulation and hyperinflation of the lungs. The second document talks about low catecholamine levels in preterm infants who developed TTN. The third document presents cases of symptomatic neonatal plethora, which can be a cause of TTN. There is no mention of radiological features specifically for TTN in these documents. Therefore, we need to analyze the provided choices carefully. Option A, reticulogranular appearance, and option D, air bronchogram, are not related to TTN. Option B, low volume lungs, is an unusual feature and could be a distinguishing characteristic of TTN. Option C, prominent horizontal fissure, is a radiological feature commonly seen in infants with hyperinflation of the lungs, which is consistent with the diagnosis of TTN.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
