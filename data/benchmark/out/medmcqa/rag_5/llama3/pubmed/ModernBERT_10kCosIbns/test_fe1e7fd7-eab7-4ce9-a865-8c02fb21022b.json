["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the treatment of various types of pulpitis and pulpectomies in primary teeth. The document on agreement between clinical and histologic findings in chronic coronal pulpitis in primary teeth indicates that a favorable outcome of pulpotomy presupposes a healthy root pulp. No wound dressing is known to induce healing of chronically inflamed pulp tissue. This suggests that the success of pulpectomy and pulp capping may depend on the initial health of the root pulp. The document on pulpectomy procedure for deciduous teeth with severe pulpal necrosis provides criteria for successful treatment, including absence of pain, firmness in the alveolar socket, and no pathologic root resorption. This suggests that the success of pulpectomy may depend on the initial condition of the tooth and pulp. The document on long-term prognosis of traumatized permanent anterior teeth showing calcifying processes in the pulp cavity does not provide direct information on pulpectomy or pulp capping in primary teeth, but it suggests that the late development of pulp necrosis may be correlated with severe injury and complete root formation. This provides some insight into the factors that may affect the success of pulpectomy and pulp capping.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
