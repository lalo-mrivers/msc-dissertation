["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about guiding planes on abutment teeth. The relevant documents mention abutment teeth several times, but the concept of guiding planes is not explicitly discussed. However, we can infer that it might be related to the design and functionality of dental bridges or implants. The document '[Mechanical studies on the dental bridges]' discusses load analysis on abutment teeth, which could be relevant to guiding planes. Additionally, the 'UCLA abutment' paper mentions the design of the abutment allowing fabrication of the restoration directly to the implant fixture, bypassing the transmucosal abutment cylinder. This might imply that guiding planes are involved in this process. However, there is no explicit mention of guiding planes in any of the provided documents.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
