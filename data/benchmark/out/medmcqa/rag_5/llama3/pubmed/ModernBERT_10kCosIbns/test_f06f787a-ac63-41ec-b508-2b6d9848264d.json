["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about negative acute phase reactants. Acute phase reactants are proteins that increase during inflammation or tissue damage. C-reactive protein (CRP) is a well-known positive acute phase reactant, meaning its levels increase during inflammation. Albumin, on the other hand, is a negative acute phase reactant, as its levels decrease during inflammation. Ferritin and haptoglobin are also negative acute phase reactants.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
