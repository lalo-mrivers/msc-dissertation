["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question describes a high velocity gunshot injury with periosteal denudation & comminuted fracture. The key to the treatment is that it's a high velocity injury which means temporary cavitation does occur and damage is not confined to the projectile pathway. This suggests that extensive debridement is necessary to prevent infection. Additionally, the presence of comminuted fracture indicates the need for reconstruction plates and grafting. Therefore, option D: Initially debridement is done, then load bearing reconstruction plates, and grafting in secondary procedure, is the best treatment approach.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
