["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the maxillary metal partial denture framework. The provided documents describe different types of removable dentures and their designs, but they don't specifically mention maxillary metal partial denture frameworks. However, we can look for information on palatal or lingual structures that might be related to the options. In the document '[Therapeutic immediate denture, class II]', it's mentioned that 'The position and the orientation of a normal occlusal plane can only be accurately determined by cephalometric analysis.' This suggests that the focus is more on the occlusal plane rather than specific metal frameworks. In the document '[Complete removable dentures and prognathism]', it describes the treatment for two patients with total edentation and a prognathic malocclusion, but again, there's no mention of maxillary metal partial denture frameworks.\n\nThe options provided are all related to palatal structures, which might be relevant to the question. However, based on the information available, we can't determine which one is not a major maxillary metal partial denture framework. Therefore, it's necessary to make an educated guess.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
