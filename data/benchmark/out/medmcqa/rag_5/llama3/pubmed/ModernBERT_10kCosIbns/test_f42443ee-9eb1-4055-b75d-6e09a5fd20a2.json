["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for an optimal landmark for termination of cleaning, shaping, and obturation. The relevant documents discuss pulp capping and surface alterations on dental restorative materials, but they don't provide direct information about the optimal landmark. However, we can look at the document that discusses the treatment of exposed bi- or trifurcations. According to this study, curettes leave the roughest root surface, whereas ultrasonics and rotary diamond burs produce smoother surfaces. This suggests that a rougher surface might be undesirable for obturation, which implies that we should aim for a smoother surface. Based on this information, we can infer that the optimal landmark for termination of cleaning, shaping, and obturation is likely to be at or near the apical constriction.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
