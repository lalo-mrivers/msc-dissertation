["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents mention the use of anticoagulants for blood glucose testing. In one of the documents, a rapid screening method for blood glucose estimation is described. The procedure requires about three minutes to perform and utilize a tungstic acid precipitant solution and urine glucose dipsticks. Test results correlate with those of a reference quantitative glucose method at levels from 25 to 500 mg/dl (1.38 to 27.5 mmol/l). Hemolysis, lipemia, and bilirubin levels as high as 20 mg/dl (342 mmol/l) do not interfere with the procedure.\", \"answer_choice\": A}"]
