["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To find the answer, we need to calculate the 95th percentile of the blood pressure distribution. The mean systolic blood pressure is given as 125 mmHg with a standard deviation of 10. We can use the z-score formula to find the 95th percentile. First, we need to standardize the mean by subtracting it from each data point and then divide by the standard deviation. This gives us the z-scores. Then, we need to find the 95th percentile by adding the z-score corresponding to that percentile to the mean.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
