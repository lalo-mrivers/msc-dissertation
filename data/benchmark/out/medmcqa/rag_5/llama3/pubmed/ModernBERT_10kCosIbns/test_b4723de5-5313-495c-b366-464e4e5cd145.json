["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to the provided documents, it can be seen that adhesion of tooth surfaces is created by the volumetrically small organic portion of these tissues. Additionally, dental adhesive systems contain monomers with hydrophilic and hydrophobic groups that provide a stable link between the tooth structure and the bulk of the restoration. Given this information, we need to find the mechanism of adhesion of GIC (Glass Ionomer Cement) restoration with tooth surface. GIC restorations are polymer-based systems that adhere chemically to dentine. Therefore, it is likely that the mechanism of adhesion is related to chemical bonding.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
