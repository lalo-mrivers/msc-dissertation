["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the course of nerves within the mandible. The inferior alveolar nerve (IAN) is a large nerve that runs between the mandibular and mental foramina. This nerve sends branches directly to the teeth or contributes to a plexus of nerves which does the same. The lingual nerve is mentioned as a separate nerve that enters the mandibular foramen.
