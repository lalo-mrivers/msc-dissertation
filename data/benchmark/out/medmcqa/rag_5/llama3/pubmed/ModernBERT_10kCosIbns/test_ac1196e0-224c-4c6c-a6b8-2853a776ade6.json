["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Upon reviewing the provided documents, it is clear that socio-economic indicators are related to people's social economic condition. The first document discusses comparative indices constructed with factor analysis to assess health and social development. The third document presents a scoring system developed for grading socioeconomic status on a ten-point scale based on variables defining 'life-style'. The fourth document explores the relationship between life events, trauma, and mental disorder, using various economic measures.\n\nComparing these documents to the potential choices, it is clear that literacy rate (related to health development) and life expectancy at birth (also related to health development) are socio-economic indicators. Housing can be considered a socio-economic indicator as well, as it relates to people's living conditions. Family size is also a demographic characteristic often used in socio-economic studies.\n\nHowever, there seems to be no direct connection between the provided documents and unemployment, which might be an economic indicator rather than a socio-economic one.\", \"answer_choice\": D}"]
