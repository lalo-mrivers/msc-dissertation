["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Since we are interested in comparing the fat content of expressed breast milk between pre-term and term infants, a study design that involves following these two groups over time would be suitable.

Therefore, we need to consider longitudinal study design as it allows us to track changes over time and compare the fat content in expressed breast milk between pre-term and term infants.\", \"answer_choice\": C}"]
