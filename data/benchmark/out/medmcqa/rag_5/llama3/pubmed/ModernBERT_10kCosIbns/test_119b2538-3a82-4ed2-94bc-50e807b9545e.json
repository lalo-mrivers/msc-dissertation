["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the modulus of elasticity of a cement that can support under complex amalgam restoration. The relevant documents describe studies on different types of cements, including ZnPO4 and ZOE. According to the document 'Effects of cement bases on the stresses in amalgam restorations', the maximum tensile stresses and deflections in the amalgam restoration increased at least threefold with a zinc oxide-eugenol (ZOE) base as compared with a ZnPO4 cement base. This suggests that ZOE is not suitable to support under complex amalgam restoration. Therefore, we can rule out options C and D. The remaining option B, ZnPO4, is the best choice.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
