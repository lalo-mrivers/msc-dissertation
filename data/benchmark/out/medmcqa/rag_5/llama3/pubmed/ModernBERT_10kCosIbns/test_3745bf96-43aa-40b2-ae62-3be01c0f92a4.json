["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has secondary amenorrhea since the spontaneous abortion. FSH is 6 IU/mL which indicates that gonadotropins are normal. The question asks for the most probable cause of amenorrhea. Considering the options, ovarian failure (A) and pituitary failure (B) can be ruled out because FSH level is within normal range. Cyclic bleeding at regular intervals can be induced if there is no ovarian failure. Ongoing pregnancy (C) also seems less likely as it would not cause amenorrhea after a spontaneous abortion. Uterine synechiae (D) could be the possible cause as it may lead to secondary amenorrhea.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
