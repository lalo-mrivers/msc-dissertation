["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for the best index to measure cardiac afterload. Based on the provided documents, it can be seen that various methods have been utilized as a measure of afterload, including wall stress, impedance, vascular resistance, and aortic pressure. However, each has some shortcomings which may limit its applicability. The document [Interdependence of preload, afterload and contractility: their relation to cardiac function curve] emphasizes the interdependency of the determinants of cardiac performance, suggesting that we cannot isolate one determinant from the other. Therefore, it is necessary to integrate these informations to make clinical decision under uncertain situations.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D\n}"]
