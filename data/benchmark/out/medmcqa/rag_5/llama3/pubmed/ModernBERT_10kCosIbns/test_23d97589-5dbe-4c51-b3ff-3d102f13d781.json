["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The crude birth rate is given as 20 for the sub-center. Crude birth rate is the number of live births per thousand population. It does not take into account the age and sex distribution of the population. The number of pregnant women registered in the sub-center is not directly related to the crude birth rate. However, if we assume that the average pregnancy results in one baby, then we can calculate the total number of deliveries in the sub-center as 20/1000 * X, where X is the total population of the sub-center. Since there are no additional details provided about the population size, we cannot determine the exact number of pregnant women.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
