["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks which of the following is NOT true about the larynx. The relevant documents describe the structure of the normal rat larynx, imaging of the larynx, morphological assessment of pathological changes within the rat larynx, diseases of the larynx, and diagnosis of carcinoma of the larynx. None of the provided choices directly relate to these topics. However, we can use our knowledge of human anatomy to make an informed decision. In humans, the intrinsic muscles of the larynx are supplied by the recurrent laryngeal nerve (A), the cricothyroid muscle is supplied by the external laryngeal nerve (B), the posterior cricoarytenoid muscle abducts the vocal cords (C). The lymphatic drainage of the larynx in humans is to the jugulodigastric nodes, not the deep cervical nodes (D). Therefore, option D is the correct answer.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
