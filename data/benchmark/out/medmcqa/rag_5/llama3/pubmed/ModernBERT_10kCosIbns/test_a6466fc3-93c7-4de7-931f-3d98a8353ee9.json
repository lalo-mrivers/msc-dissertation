["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the best method to detect translocation t(11;22) in Ewing's sarcoma. Based on the provided documents, we know that a specific translocation t(11;22)(q24;q12) is characteristic of Ewing's sarcoma. We also know that FISH (Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization) was used to characterize a complex translocation in a previous study on Ewing's sarcoma. Considering these points, the best method to detect this specific translocation would likely be FISH.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
