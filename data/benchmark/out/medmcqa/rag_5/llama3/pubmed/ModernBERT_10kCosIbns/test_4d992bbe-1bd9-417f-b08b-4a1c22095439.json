["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about mother-to-children transmission. In the provided documents, we can find information about vertical transmission, which is discussed in the 'Analysis of family history data for evidence of non-Mendelian inheritance resulting from vertical transmission' document. This type of transmission is non-Mendelian and occurs through direct parent-to-progeny transfer. The mode of transmission is not limited to one parent, but rather can involve either maternal or paternal lineages. Therefore, mother-to-children transmission is a key feature of mitochondrial inheritance.\", \"answer_choice\": D}"]
