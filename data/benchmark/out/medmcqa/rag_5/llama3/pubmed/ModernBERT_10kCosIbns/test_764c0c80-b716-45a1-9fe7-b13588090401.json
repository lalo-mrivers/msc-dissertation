["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for the central value of a set of 180 values. The options provided are A: 2nd tertile, B: 90th percentile, C: 2nd quartile, and D: 9th decile. To determine the correct answer, we need to identify the central value among these options. Since there is no information about whether the set of values is normally distributed or not, we cannot use statistical measures like mean or median directly. However, looking at the options, we can see that the 2nd quartile (option C) and 2nd tertile (option A) both refer to a middle value in the set of data. Considering this, it is likely that one of these two options is the correct answer.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
