["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about 'Malignant pustule'. The relevant documents mention different types of pustules, such as spongiform pustule of Kogoj, unilocular pustules involving the hair follicular infundibulum or a subcorneal unilocular pustule on the palmo-plantar skin. None of these descriptions match with malignant pustule. Therefore, I will focus on the histological findings that are common to both skin and mucosa mentioned in the first document. It mentions that spongiform pustules of Kogoj are common to lesions of both skin and mucosa. This description is not related to a specific type of pustular lesion, but rather a general characteristic shared by multiple types of pustular eruptions.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: None of the above\""]
