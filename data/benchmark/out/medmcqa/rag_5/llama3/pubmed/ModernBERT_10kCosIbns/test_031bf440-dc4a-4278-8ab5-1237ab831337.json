["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the properties of zinc oxide eugenol cement and polycarboxylate cement. The key points are that the distribution of compressive strength results for a zinc oxide eugenol cement is negatively skewed, while the rate of elution of ions from polycarboxylate cements decreases with age. Both types of cements can bond to tooth structure through chemical bonds. Chelation is mentioned as an additive in one of the commercial glass-ionomer cement liquids, but not specifically related to zinc oxide eugenol or polycarboxylate cements. There is no mention of polyacrylic acid being liquid, and substitution of eugenol by EBA to increase strength of cement is not a relevant concept for either type of cement.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
