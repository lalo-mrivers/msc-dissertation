["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the pattern of enamel prism demineralization. The provided documents discuss various aspects of tooth enamel, including its structure and properties, matrix-mineral relationships, and changes during development. However, none of the documents specifically address the topic of enamel prism demineralization. Therefore, we must rely on general knowledge of enamel prism structure and function to answer this question. Enamel prisms are rod-shaped structures composed of hydroxyapatite crystals. The prism heads and tails have different crystal structures and properties. The prism heads tend to be more resistant to acid dissolution due to their higher concentration of calcium ions. On the other hand, the prism tails are more susceptible to acid dissolution due to their lower concentration of calcium ions. Therefore, based on our understanding of enamel prism structure and function, we can conclude that the tail is more resistant to dissolution.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
