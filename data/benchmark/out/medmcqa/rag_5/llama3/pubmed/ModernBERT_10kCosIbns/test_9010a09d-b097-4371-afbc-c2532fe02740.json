["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the concept of phase-contrast microscopy, which is used to enhance image contrast by taking advantage of differences in refractive indices between object and background. This principle is applied in various forms of imaging, including electron microscopy and optical microscopy. Therefore, it can be inferred that Phase-contrast microscopy is based on the principle of Different refractive indices of object.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
