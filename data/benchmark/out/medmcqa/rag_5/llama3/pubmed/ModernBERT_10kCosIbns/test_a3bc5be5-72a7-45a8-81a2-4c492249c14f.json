["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the host tissue response in acute inflammation. Acute inflammation is characterized by a rapid and localized response to injury or infection. The main features of acute inflammation are exudation of fluid and cells into the affected area, followed by proliferation of connective tissue and formation of granulation tissue. Necrotizing and granulomatous reactions are typically seen in chronic inflammation, not acute inflammation. Cytopathic changes can occur in both acute and chronic inflammation, but they do not define the host tissue response. Therefore, the correct answer is B: Necrotizing.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
