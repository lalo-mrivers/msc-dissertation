["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the major determinant of loading dose. From the relevant documents, we can see that accumulation following repeated doses is no individual behavior of a drug, but always happens if the rate of invasion of a drug exceeds its rate of evasion. This suggests that the rate of invasion and evasion are important factors in determining the loading dose. The paper 'Relationship between loading dose and infusion rate to achieve any fraction of the steady-state level in any compartment model' also proposes the calculation of the loading dose as a function of the infusion rate K0 and model parameters. This implies that the infusion rate is an important factor in determining the loading dose.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
