["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about X-Linked Severe Combined Immunodeficiency (XSCID). The relevant documents mention that the genes involved in X-linked immunodeficiencies have been mapped to loci distributed throughout the X chromosome. Additionally, it is mentioned that obligate carriers of these disorders are normal by all immunologic criteria, suggesting that the defective gene is on the X chromosome. In one of the documents, it is stated that the molecular bases of the X-linked immunodeficiency diseases remain largely undetermined, except for two genes involved in chronic granulomatous disease and properdin deficiency. However, it is mentioned that substantial progress has been made in identifying the genes which are defective in the other five diseases, including XSCID.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
