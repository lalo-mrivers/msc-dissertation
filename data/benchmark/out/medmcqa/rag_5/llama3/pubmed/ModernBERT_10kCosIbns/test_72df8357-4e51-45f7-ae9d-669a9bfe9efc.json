["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the mechanism of lidocaine's antiarrhythmic effects. We need to find information that relates to this. The relevant documents are about lidocaine's influence on brain amines, its effect on accumulation and depletion rates of mouse brain amines, its pharmacokinetics, and its use in treating cardiac arrhythmias. From the text, we can see that lidocaine affects serotonin and dopamine levels in the brain, which are central inhibitory transmitters. This suggests that lidocaine may be acting by inhibition of central inhibitory pathways, possibly a dopaminergic or tryptaminergic pathway or both. Additionally, we know that lidocaine has a regularising effect on atrial arrhythmias by depressing enhanced focal activity in the atria.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
