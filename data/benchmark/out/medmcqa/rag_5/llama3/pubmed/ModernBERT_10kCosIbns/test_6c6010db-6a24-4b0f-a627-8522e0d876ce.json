["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks which component of zinc oxide-eugenol cement gives its strength. The provided documents mention the properties and composition of different cements. The document 'Examination of the test for compressive strength applied to zinc oxide eugenol cements' states that compressive strength is a function of the diameter-length ratio of the cylinder and increases with this ratio, but it does not specify which component gives the strength. Therefore, we have to look at other documents. The document 'A comparison of two methods for removing zinc oxide-eugenol provisional cement' does not mention anything about the components that give the strength of zinc oxide-eugenol cement. The documents 'Light, scanning and electron microscopic studies of the substrate dependence in replacement cementum formation' and 'Powder enrichment effects on film thickness of zinc phosphate cement' do not seem to be relevant to this question. The document 'Zinc polycarboxylate cements: a chemical study of erosion and its relationship to molecular structure' does not mention anything about zinc oxide-eugenol cement. Therefore, we have to look at the composition of the cement. According to the document 'Examination of the test for compressive strength applied to zinc oxide eugenol cements', the distribution of compressive strength results is negatively skewed and removal of a small number of outlying low results converts the distribution to a normal one. Crosshead speed and friction at the anvil have no significant effect on results, but compressive strength is a function of the diameter-length ratio of the cylinder and increases with this ratio. This suggests that zinc oxide gives the strength of the cement.\", \"answer_choice\": B}"]
