["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents discuss bone adaptation to stress, bone grafts, determinants of mechanical properties, and aging of bone tissue. The question asks about the type of bone present in the inter-radicular area. In the document 'Determinants of the mechanical properties of bones', it is mentioned that the behavior of a macroscopic structure depends on its shape and size, and on the mechanical properties of the material within. The latter are assumed to depend on the composition (porosity and mineralization) and organization (trabecular or cortical bone architecture, collagen fiber orientation, fatigue damage) of the bone. This suggests that cancellous bone is likely present in the inter-radicular area.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
