["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The provided documents describe the development of thermogenic adipose tissue, specifically brown adipose tissue (BAT). It is mentioned that BAT participates as thermogenic tissue throughout the entire life of small rodents, chiropterans, and insectivores. However, in other endotherms and humans, convertible adipose tissue (CAT) participates only during early postnatal period. Since we are asked about a specific site where brown adipose tissues don't exist, let's analyze the provided information. According to the documents, thermogenic adipocytes contain specific UC-mitochondria with uncoupling protein (UCP). Therefore, sites where brown adipose tissues are expected to be found are those that have UC-mitochondria and UCP throughout the entire life of small rodents, chiropterans, and insectivores. Based on this information, we can exclude options A and D because they do not mention any relationship with thermogenic adipose tissue or UC-mitochondria.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
