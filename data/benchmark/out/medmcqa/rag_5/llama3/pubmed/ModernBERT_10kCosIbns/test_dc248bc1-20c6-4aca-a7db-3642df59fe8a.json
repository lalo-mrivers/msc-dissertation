["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about signal transduction pathways, which are mentioned in the 'Signal Transduction' document. This document explains that ordered cell proliferation relies on a complex interplay between diverse cell types, interstitial stroma and organ vasculature. At a cellular level the response to growth stimuli is dependent on the bidirectional exchange of information between the cell membrane and nucleus. Specific regulatory molecules enable the transfer of growth signals and constitute the signal transduction pathways. This suggests that signal transduction occurs through intrinsic or extrinsic pathways.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
