["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the treatment of a baby born to a mother with chronic hepatitis B infection. The mother is HBsAg positive but HBeAg negative. This suggests that the mother is an asymptomatic carrier and has no risk of transmitting the disease to her child through vertical transmission.\n\nTransmission studies have shown that children born to HBsAg-positive, HBeAg-negative mothers are unlikely to be infected (Transmission of hepatitis type B from healthy HBsAg-positive mothers). Therefore, it is likely that the baby is not infected with hepatitis B virus infection.\n\nThe key is to prevent perinatal transmission. According to the document [Prevention of perinatal hepatitis B virus transmission], detection guided by medical and socio-familial criteria would not be efficacious for non-African and non-Asiatic women, but systematic detection of AgHBs in pregnant women is recommended.\n\nBased on these findings, it is recommended that both active and passive immunization should be given to the baby soon after birth. This is because the risk of transmission from an asymptomatic carrier mother like this one is low, but not zero, and giving both forms of immunization provides the best protection for the baby.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
