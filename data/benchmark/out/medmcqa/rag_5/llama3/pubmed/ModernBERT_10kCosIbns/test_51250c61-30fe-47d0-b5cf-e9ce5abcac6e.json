["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the provided documents, we can see that retrospective studies are discussed, but cross-sectional studies are not explicitly mentioned. However, sample selection is an important part of a research study, and probability and nonprobability sampling domains are described. This suggests that cross-sectional studies are likely to be a type of observational study, which involves collecting data from multiple subjects at one point in time. The question asks about 'same' or 'different' individuals and age groups, which implies a consideration of the sample selection for this type of study.\n\nConsidering the importance of sample selection, we can deduce that the correct answer must describe the characteristics of the participants in a cross-sectional study. Since the study is observational, it likely involves collecting data from multiple subjects at one point in time, and therefore, different individuals are being studied with respect to age groups.\n\nThe provided documents do not mention specific details about cross-sectional studies, but they provide general information about research design, sampling, and ethics. Therefore, we can rely on our understanding of observational studies and the characteristics of cross-sectional designs to inform our answer.\n\nWith this reasoning in mind, we can conclude that option B: Different individuals but of same age groups is the most likely correct answer.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
