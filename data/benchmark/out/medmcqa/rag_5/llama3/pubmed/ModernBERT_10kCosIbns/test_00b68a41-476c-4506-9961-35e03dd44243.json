["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the given documents, it can be seen that glycogen synthesis is a process that involves the conversion of glucose-1-phosphate to glycogen through the action of enzymes like glycogen synthase and branching enzyme. On the other hand, glycogenolysis is the breakdown of glycogen into glucose-6-phosphate and is catalyzed by enzymes like glycogen phosphorylase. From this information, it can be inferred that the enzyme common between glycogenesis and glycogenolysis is likely to be involved in both processes. Among the given options, glycogen synthase is also involved in glycogenolysis as a phosphorylase kinase substrate.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
