["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents discuss formocresol pulpotomy technique for primary molars. In 'Therapeutic pulpotomies in primary molars with the formocresol technique', the authors describe their experience with this technique and do not mention cotton applied to pulpal stumps. However, in 'Periodontal changes following coronal/root perforation and formocresol pulpotomy', a clinical case report describes an iatrogenic lateral crown/root perforation and a formocresol pulpotomy, but does not provide information about the application of cotton to the pulpal stumps. No other document provides relevant information for this question. Therefore, we cannot find any information supporting the given choices.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
