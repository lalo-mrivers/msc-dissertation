["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about improved marginal adaptation in a composite restoration. We need to look for relevant information from the provided documents that could answer this question. The document 'Marginal adaptation of four tooth-coloured inlay systems in vivo' seems most relevant as it discusses margin quality of different tooth-coloured inlay systems. According to this study, the porcelain inlays and the composite inlays luted with their respective experimental luting composite showed the best marginal adaptation. This implies that the type of material used might be a factor in achieving improved marginal adaptation. Additionally, the document 'Scanning electron microscope study of marginal adaptation of amalgam in restoration finishing techniques' suggests that burnishing process can also lead to improved marginal adaptation.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
