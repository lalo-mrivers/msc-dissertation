["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the question, we know that the tidal volume is 500 mL. We also know that the intrapleural pressure was measured as -4 cm of water before inspiration and -9 cm of water after inspiration. To calculate pulmonary compliance, we need to find the change in pressure (ΔP) and the change in lung volume (ΔV). The change in pressure is the difference between the two intrapleural pressures: ΔP = 5 cm of water. The change in lung volume is the tidal volume: ΔV = 500 mL. Now we can calculate pulmonary compliance using the formula: Compliance = ΔV / ΔP. Therefore, Pulmonary Compliance = 500 mL / 5 cm of water = 0.1 L/cm.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
