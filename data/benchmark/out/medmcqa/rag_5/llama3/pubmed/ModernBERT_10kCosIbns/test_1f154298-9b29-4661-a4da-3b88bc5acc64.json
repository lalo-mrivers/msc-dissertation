["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the product of β-oxidation of odd-chain fatty acids. From the provided documents, it can be seen that even-numbered fatty acid chains are broken down into Acetyl-CoA, while odd-numbered fatty acid chains are broken down into Propionyl-CoA and subsequent products. Therefore, β-oxidation of odd-chain fatty acids produce: B: Propionyl CoA.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
