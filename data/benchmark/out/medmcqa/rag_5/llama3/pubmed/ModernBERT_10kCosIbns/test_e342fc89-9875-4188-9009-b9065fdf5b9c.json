["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"There is no relevant information about titanium alloy (Ti6Al4V) or its alpha phase in the provided documents. The documents are related to metal-ceramic interfaces, surface oxides, and thermal expansion of Pd-Ag alloys. Therefore, we cannot find any stable element in Ti6Al4V in alpha phase.\", \"answer_choice\": D}"]
