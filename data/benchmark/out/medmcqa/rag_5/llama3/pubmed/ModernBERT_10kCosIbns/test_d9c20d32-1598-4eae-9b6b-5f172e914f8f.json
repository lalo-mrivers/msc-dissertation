["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The provided documents describe various connectors for different purposes. The first document describes a connection assembly for miniature electric plug and socket systems used in the recording and stimulation of the brain in free-moving animals. The second document discusses sterile connector design, which includes four steps: alignment, exclusion, sterilization, and penetration. The third document presents an implantable in-line connector for individual lead-wires. The fourth document reports a case where undersensing occurred due to lead incompatibility and highlights the need for a robust interface standard in lead connector design. None of these documents mention arches or supporting structures, which suggests that options A and B are not relevant. Option C is related to resistance to flexing and torque, but it's not directly mentioned in the provided documents either. Therefore, the correct answer must be D: All of the above.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
