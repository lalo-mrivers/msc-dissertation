["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about reversible long acting contraceptives. The given options are Copper T (A), Laparoscopic tubal ligation (B), LNG-IUS (C), and Implanon (D). Initially, I will eliminate the options that are not reversible or not long-acting. Laparoscopic tubal ligation is a permanent procedure, so option B is not correct. Copper T is a copper-bearing intrauterine device that is considered a non-hormonal and reversible method of contraception. It is not a hormonal contraceptive, so it does not fit the description of being a long-acting one. Implanon is a subdermal implant that releases etonogestrel, which is a progestin, for three years to prevent pregnancy. It meets both criteria: it is reversible and long-acting. Therefore, Implanon (D) is not the correct answer.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
