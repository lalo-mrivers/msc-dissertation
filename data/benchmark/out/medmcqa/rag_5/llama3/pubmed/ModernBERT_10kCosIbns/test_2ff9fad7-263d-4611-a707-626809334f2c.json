["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the processing of blood before transfusion to reduce the chance of febrile non-hemolytic transfusion reaction (FNHTR). After reviewing the relevant documents, I found that FNHTR is a common adverse reaction that can occur with as little as 10-15 ml of incompatible blood. The document '[Transfusion evaluation measured by a retrospective audit]' mentions that inappropriate transfusions can lead to overexposure or unnecessary exposure to the risks inherent in any transfusion. In this context, it is important to consider the processing of blood before transfusion to reduce the risk of FNHTR.\n\nThe document '[Transfusion and the use of blood products]' discusses the importance of screening blood for infective agents and reducing infective risks. It also mentions the use of white cell depletion as a method of avoiding infectious complications. This suggests that leucocyte reduction may be an important step in processing blood before transfusion to reduce the risk of FNHTR.\n\nTherefore, considering these points, I conclude that leucocyte reduction is the most relevant processing step that can be done on the blood before transfusion to reduce the chances of febrile non-hemolytic transfusion reaction (FNHTR).\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
