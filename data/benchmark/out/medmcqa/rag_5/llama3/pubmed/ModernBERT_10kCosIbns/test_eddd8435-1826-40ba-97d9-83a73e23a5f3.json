["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about identifying the drug that does not belong to the amide group. Based on the provided documents, we can see that lignocaine, mepivacaine, and bupivacaine are all mentioned as being part of the amide group. The document 'A review of the metabolism of amide local anaesthetic agents' specifically states that amide local anaesthetics are almost completely metabolized before excretion in both animals and man. This implies that these drugs belong to the amide group.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe other options, Procaine, Xylocaine, and MDA, can be eliminated based on their chemical structure and mechanism of action, as they do not fit the description of being part of the amide group.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
