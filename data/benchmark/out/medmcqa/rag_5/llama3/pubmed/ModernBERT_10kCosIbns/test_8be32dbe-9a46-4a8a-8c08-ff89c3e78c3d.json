["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents suggest that the fetal adrenals release hormones such as corticosterone, cholesterol, testosterone, estradiol, and dehydroepiandrosterone. Sex differences in fetal sheep adrenal steroidogenesis indicate that female fetuses have higher levels of corticosterone, cholesterol, testosterone, and estradiol compared to male fetuses. Ultrastructural study on the hypothalamic-hypophysial-adrenal axis in fetal rats suggests that the hypothalamus is indispensable for normal adrenocortical function during prenatal life. Steroid production by definitive and fetal zones of the human fetal adrenal gland indicates that the fetal zone primarily secretes dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHAS), while the definitive zone mainly produces corticoids. Based on these findings, it can be concluded that fetal adrenals release DHAS predominantly.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A: Coisone\""]
