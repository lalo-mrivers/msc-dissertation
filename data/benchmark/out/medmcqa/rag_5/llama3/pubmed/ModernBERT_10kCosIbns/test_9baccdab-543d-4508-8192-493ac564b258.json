["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents provide information about the phrenic nerve's activity and its relation to ventilation. In the study 'Ventilation estimated from efferent phrenic nerve activity in the paralysed cat', it is mentioned that after paralysing the cat, this relationship can be used to estimate 'spontaneous tidal volume' from the phrenic nerve activity. Additionally, in the study 'Properties of postganglionic sympathetic neurons with axons in phrenic nerve', the presence of cardiac and respiratory rhythmicities was detected in the activity of the phrenic postganglionic sympathetic neurons. This suggests that the phrenic nerve is involved in respiratory control.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
