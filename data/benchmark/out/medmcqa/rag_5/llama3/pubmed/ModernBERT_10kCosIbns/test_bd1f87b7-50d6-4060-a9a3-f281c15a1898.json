["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the tooth whose buccal surface is made of 2 lobes. The relevant documents don't mention this specific characteristic. However, we can look for information on the morphology of different teeth. In 'Surface structure of tooth germs from newborn infants: a light and scanning electron microscopical study', it's mentioned that the incisors have a smooth surface at the incisal third, while the rest has pits caused by Tomes' processes. This suggests that the buccal surface might not be made up of 2 lobes for incisors.\n\nThe other option is to look at the classification of single-rooted, pulpless teeth. However, this document doesn't provide information on tooth morphology or lobing patterns.\n\nThe other documents don't seem to have relevant information either. Therefore, we need to rely on our knowledge of human anatomy and dentistry. According to our knowledge, molars are the only teeth that have a buccal surface made up of 2 lobes. The upper 1st molar is one such tooth.\", \n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
