["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the provided documents, we can see that acidosis is a common complication during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) as mentioned in [The effect of acid-base management on the oxygen uptake of the human body during hypothermic extracorporeal circulation]. The study suggests that pH-stat management and alpha-stat management have no significant differences in terms of metabolic parameters, including acidosis. Therefore, it is unlikely that epinephrine or glucose would be effective in counteracting acidosis during CPB. However, the document [Acid-base disturbances in surgical operation] mentions that severe acidosis can occur due to postoperative complications such as respiratory insufficiency, renal failure, and hypovolemic or septic shock. Given this information, it is likely that sodium bicarbonate would be more effective in counteracting acidosis than epinephrine or glucose.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
