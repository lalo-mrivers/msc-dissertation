["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the growth pattern of the maxilla during fetal development. According to Prenatal growth pattern of the human maxilla, there are two pairs of accentuated growth areas in the fetal maxillae, which demarcate the maxillary trapezoid (MT). The dimensional increase in the MT during the fetal period is documented and statistically analyzed. From this series of results, we have suggested that the growth centers which demarcate the MT are the basic structures of the developing human maxilla. It was also found that the four primary growth centers are the most active sites for maxilla formation until 20 weeks of gestation and thereafter the growth of the maxilla is enhanced by the participation of the intramembranous bone formation along the periphery.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
