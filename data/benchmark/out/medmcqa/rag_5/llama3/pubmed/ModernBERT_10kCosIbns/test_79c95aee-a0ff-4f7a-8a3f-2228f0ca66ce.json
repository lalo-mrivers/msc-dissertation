["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents highlight the development of new biocompatible membranes for clinical application. In 'Biocompatibility and membrane development', it is mentioned that a compromise between different approaches has to be found to achieve optimal results with one single polymer. In 'Tissue engineering by cell transplantation using degradable polymer substrates', polylactic acid is mentioned as a bioresorbable polymer used in the design of successful devices for cell transplantation. This information suggests that polylactic acid might be a suitable choice.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
