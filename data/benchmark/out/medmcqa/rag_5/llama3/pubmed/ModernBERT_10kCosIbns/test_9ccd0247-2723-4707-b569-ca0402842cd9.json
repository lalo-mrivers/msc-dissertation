["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about non-contraceptive uses of levonorgestrel. The relevant documents describe the pharmacokinetics of levonorgestrel in different studies. None of these documents explicitly mention levonorgestrel being used for endometriosis, premenstrual tension, or complex endometrial hyperplasia.
