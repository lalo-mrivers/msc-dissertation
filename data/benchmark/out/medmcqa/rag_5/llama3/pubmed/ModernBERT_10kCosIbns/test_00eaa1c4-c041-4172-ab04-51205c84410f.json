["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the origin of progenitor hematopoietic stem cells. The relevant documents describe hematopoietic stem cells as phenotypically very heterogeneous, capable of high-level proliferative activity and multilineage differentiation. Hematopoietic stem cells exist in a quiescent state for prolonged periods of time, and their mechanism(s) involved in triggering them to enter the cell cycle is not totally clear; however, cytokines are implicated. The documents also describe the development of embryonic stem cells into hematopoietic precursors of most, if not all, of the colony-forming cells found in normal bone marrow. Therefore, it can be inferred that progenitor hematopoietic stem cells originate from embryonic stem cells.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
