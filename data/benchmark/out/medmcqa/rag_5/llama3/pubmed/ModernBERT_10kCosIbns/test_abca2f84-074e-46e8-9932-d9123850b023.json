["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about a suitable fixative for a routine biopsy specimen. The relevant documents describe different fixation methods. [Fundamentals of fixation of cytological preparations] mentions that the well-experienced cytopathologist is mandatory for interpretation of the specimen, but does not specify the type of fixative. [A new preparation method for several histopathological examinations on a single block] describes a fixation method using JB-4, methylmethacrylate and divinylbenzene, which is used to stabilize carbohydrate moieties. This method is different from those described in [Method of preparation and staining of microscopic sections in emergency biopsy], which uses Harris hematoxylin as the fixative. Therefore, considering these documents, 10% formalin is a common and suitable fixative for routine biopsy specimens.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
