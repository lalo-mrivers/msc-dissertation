["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking when mean and standard deviation can be worked out. The relevant documents describe various types of data scales, including nominal, ordinal, dichotomous, interval/ratio. Nominal scale does not allow for mathematical operations such as calculating mean and standard deviation. Dichotomous scale also does not provide a clear answer as it is a special type of categorical data. Ordinal scale can be ordered but lacks the ability to perform mathematical operations. Interval/Ratio scale allows for both ordering and mathematical operations, making it possible to calculate mean and standard deviation. Therefore, the correct answer is C: Interval/Ratio scale.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
