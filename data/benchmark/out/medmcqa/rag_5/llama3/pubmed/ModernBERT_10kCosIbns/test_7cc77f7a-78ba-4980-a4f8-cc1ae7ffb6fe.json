["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the composition of the soft palate. The first relevant document mentions that a typical adult soft palate consists of several major tissue layers including the oral aspect (glandular with a zone of adipose tissue), two middle layers (muscular) and a superoanterior layer consisting of the tensor veli palatini tendon, as well as a posteroinferior layer. The document does not mention Palatoglossus or palatopharyngeus, which are muscles involved in swallowing and speech. The uvula is mentioned, but it is not the entire soft palate.
