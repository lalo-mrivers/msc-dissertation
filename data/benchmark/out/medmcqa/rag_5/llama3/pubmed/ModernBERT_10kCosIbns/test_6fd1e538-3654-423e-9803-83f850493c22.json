["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the effect of a drug that blocks the permeability of Z on the resting membrane potential. Since the equilibrium potentials of X and Y are -30mV and -40mV respectively, this means that there is a net inward current for both X and Y at the resting membrane potential. The presence of Z ions would normally allow for an outward current to balance out the inward currents of X and Y, resulting in a stable resting membrane potential. However, if the drug blocks the permeability of Z, then the outward current carried by Z ions will be reduced or eliminated. This means that the net inward current for X and Y will no longer be balanced, leading to a depolarization.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
