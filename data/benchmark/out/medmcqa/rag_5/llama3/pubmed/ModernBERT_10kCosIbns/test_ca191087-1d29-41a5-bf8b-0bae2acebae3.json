["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the cause of medial dislocation of fractured condyle in subcondylar fracture. None of the given options (A: Lateral pterygoid, B: Medial pterygoid, C: Masseter, D: Temporalis) are directly related to condylar fractures or its treatment. Therefore, we need to rely on the provided documents to find any relevant information. From [The therapy of condylar fractures. Clinical study for the evaluation of various modes of treatment], we can see that conservative treatment leads to the most favourable results and functional treatment does not restore the function of medial pterygoid muscle in majority of cases. This suggests that medial pterygoid might be involved in the process. However, this is not directly related to the cause of medial dislocation. From [Mandibular condyle fractures in childhood--the clinico-roentgenological follow-up], we can see that best results were achieved after unilateral displaced fractures, while only few children showed a 'restitutio ad integrum' after bilateral fractures or/and after fracture dislocations. This suggests that medial dislocation might be caused by bilateral or multiple fractures rather than a specific muscle.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
