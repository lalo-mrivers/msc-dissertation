["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about intraocular metastasis in a female. The relevant documents are the ones related to ocular myiasis and ophthalmic manifestations of systemic cancer. From the information provided, we know that ocular myiasis can be caused by various parasites, but it's not directly related to the question. The document on ophthalmic manifestations of systemic cancer mentions that the incidence of ocular metastases is approximately 300,000 cases a year, most often from breast or lung primaries.
