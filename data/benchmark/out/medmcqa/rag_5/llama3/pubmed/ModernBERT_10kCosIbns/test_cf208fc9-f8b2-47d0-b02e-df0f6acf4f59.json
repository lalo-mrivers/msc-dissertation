["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"After reviewing the provided documents, we can focus on the pulp tissue and its characteristics. The document '[Ultrastructural study of human pulp cells cultured in vitro]' describes the morphology of human dental pulp cells. It mentions the presence of a cilium, endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, secretion granules, multivesicular bodies, and microtubules. This suggests that these cells are capable of complex cellular functions, including nerve fiber production.\n\nThe document 'Healing of pulp exposures: an ultrastructural study' provides insight into the early changes that occur during pulp exposure and capping with a hard setting Ca(OH)2 cement. It mentions differentiation of cells at the wound surface, which have the characteristic features of odontoblasts and form a predentin-like collagen matrix. This suggests that these cells are involved in the development of dentin.\n\nConsidering these findings, we can infer that nerve fibers in pulp are likely to be autonomic parasympathetic and sympathetic fibres.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
