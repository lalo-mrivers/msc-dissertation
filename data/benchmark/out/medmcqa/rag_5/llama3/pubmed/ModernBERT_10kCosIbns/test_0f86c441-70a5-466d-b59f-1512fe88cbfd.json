["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for the most likely cause of hypernatremia (Serum sodium > 170m Eq/L) in a breast fed child. The provided documents discuss various causes of hypernatremia, including gastrointestinal loss, increased 'forced loss', and insufficiency parenteral feeding. In this case, the child's urine sodium is 70 mEq/L, which suggests that the child is losing both sodium and water. This is consistent with the description in the document '[Physiopathological and clinical features of hypernatremia]', where it is stated that 'sodium and water losses go together to bring about a fall in both intracellular and extracellular volume'. Given this information, the most likely cause of hypernatremia in this child is severe dehydration.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
