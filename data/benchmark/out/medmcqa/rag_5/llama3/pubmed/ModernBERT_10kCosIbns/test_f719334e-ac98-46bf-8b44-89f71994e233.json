["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents discuss various aspects of biomechanics, mechanics, and elasticity. The concept of modulus of elasticity is mentioned in the document '[Fundamentals of the biomechanics of hard tissues]', where it is stated that mechanical phenomena of living matter can be investigated merely by their own movements whereby the differing qualities and reactions of the material have to be taken into priority consideration. This implies that modulus of elasticity refers to a measure of stiffness or rigidity of a material, rather than its ability to be stretched with permanent deformation (choice B) or its ductility (choice C). The document '[Bending strength in modeling materials]' also provides information on the modulus of elasticity, stating that 12 out of 15 materials exceeded the necessary bending strength of 20 N/mm2. This suggests that modulus of elasticity is a measure of rigidity or stiffness.\",\n\"answer_choice\": A"]
