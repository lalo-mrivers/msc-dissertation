["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is undergoing epidural anesthesia with 3% Xylocaine with adrenaline. The sudden development of hypotension after 3 minutes of administration suggests that the anesthetic agent may have caused the hypotension. Since the study 'Hypotension after lumbar epidural analgesia' found that a fall in mean arterial pressure was recorded in 66% of patients after standard epidural analgesia, and the maximal fall in blood pressure always occurred within the first 25 minutes after administration of the local anaesthetic agent, it is likely that the anesthetic agent itself caused the hypotension. The study 'Common features associated with spinal-anesthesia-induced hypotension' found that physical status was less important, with the exception of emergency surgeries, and preoperative medication--especially narcotics--was associated with hypotension. Since the patient developed hypotension after only 3 minutes of administration, it is unlikely that preoperative factors contributed to the hypotension. Therefore, the most likely cause for this is systemic absorption of the drug.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
