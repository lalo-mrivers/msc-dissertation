["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks which ion of hydroxyapatite crystals is substituted by Fluoride imparts more strength. From the given documents, we know that fluoride ions increase the charge density and make the surface less prone to attack by acid or alkali (Surface properties of hydroxyapatite: I). This suggests that fluoridation may improve the strength of hydroxyapatite crystals. The document 'Heterogeneous synthesis of fluoridated hydroxyapatites' also mentions that fluoridated hydroxyapatites have different physico-chemical properties compared to non-fluoridated ones, which could imply improved strength. However, the exact mechanism is not clearly stated in these documents. Nevertheless, based on general principles and the available information, it can be inferred that the substitution of Phosphate ion by Fluoride ions imparts more strength.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
