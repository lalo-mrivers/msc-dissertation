["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the types of information carried by the dorsal column. From the provided documents, it can be inferred that the dorsal column is responsible for transmitting proprioception and vibration information. The document 'Dual dorsal columns: a review' mentions that dorsal column lesions cause motor disturbances, which supports the idea that the dorsal column plays a role in proprioception. Additionally, the document 'Dorsal column stimulation: optimization of application' discusses the use of dorsal column stimulation (DCS) to improve proprioception and motor function. The document 'Projections to the inferior colliculus from the dorsal column nuclei' also suggests that the dorsal column is involved in transmitting information related to vibration. Therefore, it can be concluded that the dorsal column primarily carries proprioception and vibration information.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
