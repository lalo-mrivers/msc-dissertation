["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents discuss amino acids and their properties. The first document talks about the inhibition of complement pathways by amino acids and their derivatives. It highlights that SH-compounds (cysteine, homocysteine, and glutathione) had the strongest inhibitory effects among these amino acids on both classical and alternative pathways. This suggests that glutamine is not just a structural component but also plays a functional role in biological processes.\n\nThe second document presents a comparative study of residue usage correlations of various organism protein sets. It reveals three major tendencies: charge compensation, positive correlations of functionally and structurally similar amino acids, and negative correlation of the aggregate strong codon group amino acids versus the weak codon group amino acids. This suggests that amino acid substitution can have functional implications.\n\nThe third document discusses the therapeutic potential of essential amino acid analogues. It highlights the possibility that these compounds may prove to be useful inducers of protein anabolism, suggesting that amino acids play a role in regulating metabolism.\n\nThe fourth document describes new developments in the synthesis of natural and unnatural amino acids. It highlights the commercialization of a process for the synthesis of natural as well as synthetic optically pure amino acids using an enzymatic kinetic resolution step on racemic amino acid amides.\n\nConsidering these points, replacing amino acid will change its functions if it affects the biological processes or metabolic pathways that depend on that amino acid. Therefore, this option is not applicable to all amino acids.\n\nThe options provided are:\n\n* Glutamine to Asparagine: This substitution changes the charge and function of the amino acid, so it may affect the biological processes that rely on glutamine.\n* Aspaate and Glutamate: These amino acids have different properties and functions, so replacing one with the other would likely change its functions.\n* Alanine to tryptophan: This is a significant substitution that changes the chemical properties and function of the amino acid.\n\nThe correct answer is D: None of these.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
