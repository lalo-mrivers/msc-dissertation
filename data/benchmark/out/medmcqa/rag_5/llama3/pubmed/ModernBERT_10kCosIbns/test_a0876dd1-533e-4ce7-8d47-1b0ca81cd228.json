["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks for something that is NOT true about piperacilline. From the provided documents, we can see that piperacilline is a ureido penicillin (document 1), but it does not inhibit Beta-lactamase (no mention in any of the documents). Piperacilline is active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (document 3) and is given parenterally (not explicitly mentioned, but as an antibiotic, it would typically be administered parenterally). Therefore, option B: Inhibits Beta-lactamase is not true about piperacilline.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
