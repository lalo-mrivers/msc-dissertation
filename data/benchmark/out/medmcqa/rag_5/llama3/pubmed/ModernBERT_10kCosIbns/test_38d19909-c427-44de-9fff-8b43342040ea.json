["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks to calculate the net filtration pressure. PGC stands for Pressure at Gas Cap, pGC is the Pressure at Gas Cap, and PBC is the Pressure at Blood Cell layer. Since no proteins were filtered, we don't need to consider any pressure related to protein filtration. We can directly use the given values: PGC = 42 mm Hg, pGC = 12 mm Hg, PBC = 16 mm Hg. The net filtration pressure is calculated by subtracting the pressure at gas cap (pGC) from the pressure at blood cell layer (PBC), which gives us: PNC = PBC - pGC = 16 mm Hg - 12 mm Hg = 4 mm Hg. Finally, we need to add the Pressure at Gas Cap (PGC): Net Filtration Pressure = PNC + PGC = 4 mm Hg + 42 mm Hg = 46 mm Hg.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
