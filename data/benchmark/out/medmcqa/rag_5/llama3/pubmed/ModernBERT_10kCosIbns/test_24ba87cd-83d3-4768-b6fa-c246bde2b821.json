["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The provided documents describe various parasitic diseases found in stool samples. From the studies on intestinal parasitic disease agents in stools of people in a rural area of Nigeria, we know that Entamoeba coli was present at a rate of 19.0%. The document 'Laboratory diagnosis of worms and miscellaneous specimens' does not specifically mention the cysts of parasites seen in stool microscopy. However, the study on intestinal and blood parasites of man in Bireuen and Takengon, Aceh Province, Sumatra, Indonesia mentions Entamoeba coli as one of the common parasites detected. The document 'Methods for sampling, collecting, preserving and carrying materials for parasitic tests (author's transl)' does not provide information about stool microscopy. Finally, the review on participant performance in the Special Parasitology Survey of the College of American Pathologists does not provide specific information about stool microscopy either. Therefore, based on the information provided in the studies on intestinal parasitic disease agents and intestinal parasites of man, we can conclude that the cyst of parasite seen in stool microscopy is likely Entamoeba coli.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
