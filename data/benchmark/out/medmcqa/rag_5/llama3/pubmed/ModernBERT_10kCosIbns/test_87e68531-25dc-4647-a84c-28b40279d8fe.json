["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question states that an affected male does not have affected children but an affected female always has affected children. This suggests that the trait or condition being inherited is sex-linked. Since an affected male does not transmit the condition to his children, it is likely that the affected males are hemizygous for the recessive allele, meaning they only have one copy of the gene. On the other hand, an affected female always has affected children, indicating that females who are homozygous or heterozygous for the recessive allele will transmit the condition to their offspring. This is consistent with X-linked recessive inheritance.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
