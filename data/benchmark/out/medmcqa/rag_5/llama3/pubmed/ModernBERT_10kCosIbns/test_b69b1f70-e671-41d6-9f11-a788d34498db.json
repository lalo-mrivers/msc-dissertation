["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks which amino acid does not include post-translational modification. The provided documents describe the extensive modification of proteins through various reactions, resulting in a substantial increase in the number of amino acids found in different proteins. However, it is mentioned that only 20 primary amino acids are specified in the genetic code and are involved as monomer building blocks in the assembly of the polypeptide chain. This suggests that any post-translational modification would be added to these 20 primary amino acids. Therefore, the answer must be one of the 20 primary amino acids.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
