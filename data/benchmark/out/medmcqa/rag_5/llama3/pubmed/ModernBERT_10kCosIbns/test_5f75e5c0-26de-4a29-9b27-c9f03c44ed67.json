["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presented with palpitations, a fast pulse, and hypotension (80/50 mmHg) that was refractory to vagal maneuver. The administration of adenosine did not change the rhythm. Given this information, it is likely that the cardiac failure or loss of vagal tone has unmasks the direct negative chronotropic effect of exogenous adenosine on the sinoatrial node (as seen in dogs with failing hearts). Therefore, further doses of adenosine are unlikely to be effective. The patient's condition suggests a supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) that is resistant to vagal maneuver and adenosine.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
