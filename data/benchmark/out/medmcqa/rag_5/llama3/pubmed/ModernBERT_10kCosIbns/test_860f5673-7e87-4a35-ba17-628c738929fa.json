["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the first document, we can see that pharmacokinetics provides a new approach to three fundamental aspects in oncology: drug toxicity, relationship between drug schedule and response in each individual, drug resistance to anticancer drugs. In the second document, we learn about the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAI) to potentiate L.M.W.H. activity in thrombosis. Since this is a study on antithrombotic efficacy, it's likely that the drug used for cancer-associated thromboembolism would be heparin-based. The third document talks about the assessment of efficacy, toxicity and quality of care in long-term drug treatment.
