["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the function of Golgi tendon organs (GTOs) as biological force transducers under static loading conditions. The mechanical events that occur within the GTO appear to explain how it may function as a position and force detector. Additionally, the studies show that GTOs can signal the contraction of motor units with different physiological properties, monitoring the contraction of every motor unit in a muscle. From these findings, it is clear that GTOs detect Muscle Tension.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
