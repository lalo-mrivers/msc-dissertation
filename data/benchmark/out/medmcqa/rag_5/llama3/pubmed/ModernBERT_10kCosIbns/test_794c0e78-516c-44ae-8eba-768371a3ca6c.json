["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the angle subtended by the largest letter in the Snellen chart on a person's eye who is reading it from a distance of 6 meters, we need to find the value of one minute of arc. According to the article 'Measuring the size of mental images', each letter occupied about 2.5 degrees of visual angle for the four-letter strings in the control/default size condition. Since the Snellen chart is typically used at a distance of 20 feet (6 meters), we can use this value as an approximation. We also know that one minute of arc is equal to about 1/60th of a degree, or approximately 2.5 minutes per letter. Therefore, we can conclude that the largest letter on the Snellen chart subtends an angle of approximately 50 minutes.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C\n}"]
