["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"After reviewing the provided documents, I can see that there is no direct mention of the best stimulator of respiratory center. However, one document [Criteria for quantitative assessment of respiratory system reactions] mentions that lung ventilation and activity of diaphragmal motoneurons are parameters that can reflect the efferent output of the respiratory center. This implies that the respiratory center is stimulated by changes in these parameters. Since there is no specific information about what specifically stimulates the respiratory center, I will rely on general physiological principles to make an educated guess.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
