["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The problem is asking for the lower limit of the average IOP that can be expected 95% of times. To solve this, we need to find the value that corresponds to the 2.5th percentile (since it's a 95% confidence interval). We are given the mean and standard deviation of the distribution, which is normal since the problem assumes so. Using the Z-table or calculator, we can find that for a mean of 30 and SD of 1, the value corresponding to the 2.5th percentile is approximately 28.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
