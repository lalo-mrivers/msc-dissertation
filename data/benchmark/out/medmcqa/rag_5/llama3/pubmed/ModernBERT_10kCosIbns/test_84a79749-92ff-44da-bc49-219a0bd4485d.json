["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to the provided documents, bacteriocin is a toxic substance produced by certain bacteria that inhibits bacterial growth. It can inhibit protein and RNA synthesis immediately after its addition to sensitive cells, and DNA synthesis is inhibited 10 minutes later. Additionally, it can kill sensitive cells rapidly but cell lysis does not appear to be involved. Furthermore, bacteriocins are antagonic for other closely related bacteria by inhibiting their growth. They can also regulate bacterial growth rate in a population as a competence mechanism for a given ecological habitat.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
