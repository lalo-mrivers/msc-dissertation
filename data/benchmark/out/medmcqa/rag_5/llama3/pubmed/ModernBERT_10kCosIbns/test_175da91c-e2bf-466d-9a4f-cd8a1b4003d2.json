["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the metabolic changes that occur during fasting. In the first document, it is mentioned that the rate of body mass loss reflects the changes in nitrogen excretion that occur over three phases of fasting. During phase III, the 10-fold higher daily locomotor activity occurred with a higher proportion of diurnal activity. This suggests that the utilization of energy reserves may change during prolonged fasting.\n\nIn the second document, it is stated that restriction of dietary carbohydrate, not the general absence of energy intake itself, is responsible for initiating the metabolic response to short-term fasting. Glycerol and palmitic acid rates of appearance in plasma were determined by infusing [2H5]glycerol and [1-13C]palmitic acid, respectively, after 12 and 84 h of oral fasting.\n\nThe third document discusses the redox state and regulation of amino acid metabolism in man. It suggests that the protein conservation evidenced by fasting man may be dependent on the reduced state of muscle tissue.\n\nThe fourth document describes the effect of total fasting on polymorphonuclear granulocyte functions, plasma iron, and serum transferrin. It notes a statistically significant depression in granulocyte bactericidal capacity against Staph. aureus.\n\nThe fifth document discusses the effect of total fasting on serum protein concentrations. It notes that haptoglobin, transferrin, and beta1A-globin showed a marked, continuous decline during a three-week period of total fasting.\n\nConsidering these documents, it can be inferred that during the fasting state, red blood cells (RBCs) use ketone bodies as their primary energy source. This is because ketone bodies are an alternative source of energy for RBCs when glucose is not available.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
