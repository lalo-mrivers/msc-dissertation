["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, we need to calculate the true positives (TP) which is equal to the prevalence of the disease multiplied by the sensitivity. So, TP = 20% x 0.95 = 19%. Then, we need to calculate the true negatives (TN) which is equal to the remaining population minus the false positives and false negatives. Since the prevalence is 20%, that means 80% are healthy, so TN = 10000 - 2000 = 8000. Next, we can calculate the false positives (FP) which is equal to the number of people who tested positive but are actually healthy. Since the specificity is 80%, that means 20% are FP, so FP = 10000 x 0.2 = 2000. Finally, we can calculate the true negatives (FN) which is equal to the number of people who tested negative but are actually diseased. Since the prevalence is 20%, that means 80% are not diseased, so FN = 10000 - 2000 = 8000. Now we can calculate the positive predictive value (PPV) by dividing the true positives by the sum of true positives and false positives. PPV = TP / (TP + FP) = 19 / (19 + 2000).\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
