["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the cause of obstructive sleep apnoea. Upon reviewing the relevant documents, I found that obstructive sleep apnoea is caused by upper airway obstruction or repetitive obstructive aponea during sleep (Sleep apnoea: causes, consequences and treatment). This is supported by another document stating that 'upper airway sleep apnoea is sleep related; the type of sleep (REM or NREM) is critical in the appearance of abnormalities.' None of the given options (A-D) are related to upper airway obstruction.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"None of the above\"\n}"]
