["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about Young's formula for calculating pediatric dose. The documents provided discuss pediatric pharmacokinetics, therapeutic drug monitoring, and novel methods for determining pediatric dosages. Upon reviewing the documents, it seems that one of the relevant pieces of information is that pediatric patients require individualized dosing due to unique differences in pharmacokinetic parameters compared to adults. This information suggests that a formula taking into account age or weight might be used to calculate pediatric doses. Therefore, we can deduce that Young's formula involves some calculation based on patient characteristics such as age or weight.\",\n\"answer_choice\": A"]
