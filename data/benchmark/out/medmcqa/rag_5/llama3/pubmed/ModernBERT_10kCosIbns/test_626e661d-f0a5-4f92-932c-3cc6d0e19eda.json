["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the factors that govern dentine permeability. From the provided documents, we can see that the permeability of dentin can be affected by chemicals such as potassium oxalate and calcium hydroxide, time elapsed since preparation, acid treatment, polyacrylic acid, chlorhexidin-digluconate, phosphoric acid, and calciumhydroxide suspension. Additionally, the documents mention that carious lesions have a low permeability, which increases after excavation of the lesion and removal of the smear layer. Based on this information, we can conclude that all of these factors govern dentine permeability EXCEPT one factor: the length of dentinal tubules.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
