["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the branches of external carotid artery in Kiesselbach's plexus. The provided documents do not directly discuss Kiesselbach's plexus or its branches. However, we can use our knowledge to identify which option is not a branch of external carotid artery. The internal carotid artery is a direct branch of the common carotid artery, and it does not have any branches. This means that the options A, B, C, and D must be branches of the external carotid artery. Upon reviewing the documents, we see that the internal carotid artery is discussed in relation to its innervation, reactivity to nerve stimulation, noradrenaline, and 5-hydroxytryptamine, but not as a branch of the external carotid artery. Therefore, it is likely that option D (Septal branch of superior labial aery) is not a branch of external carotid artery in Kiesselbach's plexus.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
