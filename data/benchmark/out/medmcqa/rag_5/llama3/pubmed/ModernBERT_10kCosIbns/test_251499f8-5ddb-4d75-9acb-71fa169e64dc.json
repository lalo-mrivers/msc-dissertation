["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"After reviewing the relevant documents, we can identify that laryngeal nerve palsy is a complication of thyroid surgery. The first document 'Surgical treatment of post-thyroidectomy laryngeal paralysis' mentions that total thyroidectomy is a frequent cause of this condition.
