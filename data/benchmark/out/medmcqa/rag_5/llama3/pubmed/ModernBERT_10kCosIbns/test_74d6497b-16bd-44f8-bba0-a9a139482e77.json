["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about wave patterns of EEF, ECG, and EMG. The given documents are related to decomposition of ECG by linear filtering, combinatorial relations in the EEG spectrum, component wave delineation of ECG by filtering in the Fourier domain, advanced time-frequency methods for signal-averaged ECG analysis, and analysis of ECG from pole-zero models. However, none of these documents mention B pattern or wave patterns of EEF, EMG. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the correct answer based on the provided information.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"None of the above\"\n}"]
