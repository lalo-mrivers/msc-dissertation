["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the posterior triangle of the neck. The relevant documents are those that describe the anatomy of the neck and cervical spine. Based on the descriptions provided, we can infer that the posterior triangle of the neck contains muscles such as the levator scapulae and the splenius capitis, as well as nerves like the spinal accessory nerve (which is not present in this question). The external jugular vein is also mentioned as running superficially through the posterior triangle. Therefore, we can conclude that the phrenic nerve, subclavian nerve, and hypoglossal nerve are not present in the posterior triangle of the neck.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
