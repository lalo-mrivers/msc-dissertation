["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Pilocarpine has an action on sphincter papillae. The dilator pupillae is the opposite of the sphincter papillae. Looking at the provided documents, pilocarpine increases outflow facility and reduces intraocular pressure. This suggests that pilocarpine's action on the sphincter papillae is to constrict it. Therefore, we are looking for a drug that has an analogous action on the dilator pupillae, which would be to constrict it. Tropicamide is a muscarinic agonist and can cause constriction of the dilator pupillae.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
