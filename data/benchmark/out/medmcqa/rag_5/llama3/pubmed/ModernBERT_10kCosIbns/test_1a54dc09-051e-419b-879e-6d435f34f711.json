["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents mention risk factors for life-threatening conditions (LTC) among infants. These risk factors are consanguineous marriages, unsatisfactory living conditions, low family incomes, maternal age under 20, third ordinal number of delivery or more, prematurity of the fetus, and peculiarities of the course and nature of pathology. None of the options A to D directly relate to these risk factors. Therefore, we need to look for other relevant information. The document 'Premature baby statistics' mentions that premature babies are considered high-risk infants. This implies that prematurity is a risk factor for high-risk infants. Option D, Twins, can also be a risk factor as it is often associated with prematurity. Hence, options D and possibly those related to prematurity could be considered high-risk infants.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
