["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the primary transmission of nociceptive signals. The provided documents discuss various structures involved in pain processing. From the study on neurophysiological data on transmission and integration of nociceptive messages, we know that ascending projections of those cells activated by nociceptive stimuli are discussed. At the same time, the problem of the ascending projections of those cells is also considered at the supra-spinal level. Among these structures, the PO group of nuclei seem to have a particular role in pain processes. The other documents discuss various aspects of nociception, such as visceral nociceptors, neuroimmunohistochemical analysis of peridiscal nociceptive neural elements, and neurotransmitters in nociceptive modulatory circuits. However, they do not specifically mention the primary transmission of nociceptive signals.\n\nThe study on sympathetic reflex responses presumably specific for nociceptive stimulation provides some insight into this issue. It suggests that the very late A response reflects the excitation of just those central structures that on repetitive stimulation organize the three-phasic command. This implies that these central structures are involved in transmitting nociceptive signals. Among the options, only one structure is mentioned as being involved in pain processing: the nucleus caudalis.\n\nTherefore, based on this information, the primary transmission of nociceptive signals is likely to occur through the nucleus caudalis.\",\n\"answer_choice\": A"]
