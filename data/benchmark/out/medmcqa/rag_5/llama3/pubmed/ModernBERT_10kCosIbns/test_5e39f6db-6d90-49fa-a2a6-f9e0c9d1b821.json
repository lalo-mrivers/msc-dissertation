["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the injuries sustained by the 2 persons who died in the bomb blast. The relevant documents describe the types of injuries that occur due to bomb blasts, including those caused by blast effect, flash, and shrapnel. The document 'The injuries of terrorist bombing: a study of 1532 consecutive patients' mentions that primary blast lung was apparent in only 2 patients and major limb amputations occurred in 16 patients. It also states that the majority of the patients suffered from emotional shock. This information suggests that the injuries caused by the bomb blast may not be due to burns or air blast.\n\nThe document 'Report on injuries sustained by patients treated at the Birmingham General Hospital following the recent bomb explosions' mentions that injuries were predominantly to the head and neck and limbs, suggesting the protective effect of clothing. It also states that half of the patients suffered from emotional shock, most with no physical injury. This information suggests that the injuries may not be due to burns or air blast.\n\nThe document 'An analysis of the post-mortem findings in the 21 victims of the Birmingham pub bombings' mentions that all 21 cases showed the terrible multiple injuries associated with close proximity to a powerful explosion within a confined space. Although all the victims suffered one or more injuries which alone would have been fatal, certain patterns of injury were noted which, if appreciated early in any future similar incident, may help to save the lives of those who are further removed from the centre of the explosion or exposed to one of lesser force.\n\nBased on this information, it is likely that the injuries sustained by the 2 persons who died in the bomb blast were not due to burns air blast.\n\nThe document 'A 38-year-old female trauma victim of a car bomb' mentions that most Midwestern areas have small cities and towns, and most of our trauma results from accidents, not deliberate, senseless human acts. There is a quality of life in our community that does not involve doing things like this to others. If our staff was this affected, it is sobering to think of the profound adjustment required of the victim.\n\nThe document '[Terrorist explosions--medical aspects]' mentions that we present the review of medical and organizational aspects of terroristic explosion as a type of urban disaster. We have focused on consequences of the explosion of unfragmented explosive devices, particularly regarding the type and localization of injuries. The definitions of urban disaster is given and organizational problems in these situations are classified.\n\nBased on this information, it is likely that the injuries sustained by the 2 persons who died in the bomb blast were not due to burns air blast.\n\nThe document 'Report on injuries sustained by patients treated at the Birmingham General Hospital following the recent bomb explosions' mentions that major limb amputations occurred in 16 patients of whom 4 died. None of the 50 patients with burns required skin grafts.\n\nBased on this information, it is likely that the injuries sustained by the 2 persons who died in the bomb blast were not due to burns air blast.\n\nThe document 'An analysis of the post-mortem findings in the 21 victims of the Birmingham pub bombings' mentions that all 21 cases showed the terrible multiple injuries associated with close proximity to a powerful explosion within a confined space.
