["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about Moyer's classification of Class II type D malocclusion. The relevant documents are the cephalometric distinction of class II, division 2 malocclusion and The class II malocclusion: differential diagnosis and clinical application of activators, extraoral traction, and fixed appliances. Upon reviewing these documents, we can conclude that Moyer's classification is not mentioned in either document, as they do not provide a detailed classification system for Class II malocclusions. Therefore, we must look at other sources or references to answer this question.\n\nOne possible source of information could be the diagnostic approach to malocclusions in dogs, which provides a standardized diagnostic plan and terminology for classifying canine malocclusions. However, since the question is asking about Moyer's classification of Class II type D malocclusion, we must look elsewhere for an answer.\n\nAnother possible source of information could be the clinical application of the ACCO appliance, which discusses the treatment of various malocclusions, including Class II malocclusions. However, again, this document does not provide a detailed classification system for Class II malocclusions.\n\nThe class II malocclusion: differential diagnosis and clinical application of activators, extraoral traction, and fixed appliances is also mentioned in the question, but it too does not provide a detailed classification system for Class II malocclusions. Therefore, we must look at other sources or references to answer this question.\n\nUnfortunately, none of the provided documents provide information about Moyer's classification of Class II type D malocclusion. Therefore, we cannot provide an answer based on the provided information.\", \"answer_choice\": null}"]
