["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the properties of polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA). From the provided documents, we can find information about PMMA. The first document mentions that the molecular weight distribution was determined by gel permeability measurements and viscosity measurements in the hardened material. This suggests that PMMA has a certain level of molecular weight distribution. The second document states that the mechanical properties of heterocyclic methacrylates have been studied, including their potential for low polymerization shrinkage systems. However, it does not provide specific information about PMMA's mechanical properties. The third and fourth documents do not mention PMMA specifically, but they do discuss various aspects of methacrylate monomers and polymers. Based on this information, we can infer that PMMA is a type of polymer with certain physical properties.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
