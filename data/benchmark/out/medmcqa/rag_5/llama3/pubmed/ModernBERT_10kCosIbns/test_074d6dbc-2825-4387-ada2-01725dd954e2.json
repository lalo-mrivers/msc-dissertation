["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The provided documents discuss various methods for measuring body fluid volume changes. One method uses tritiated water or radio-sodium to model an open, interconnected two-compartment system. Another method measures interstitial pressure during acute interstitial volume depletion in normally hydrated rats. The papers also discuss the use of radioactive markers and ion-sensitive micro-electrodes to determine interstitial volume fraction and tortuosity.\n\nThe provided question asks about determining interstitial fluid volume. From the documents, we can see that one method uses radioactive tracers such as radio-sodium and radioactive water to model an open, interconnected two-compartment system. This suggests that option C: Radioactive sodium and radioactive water is the correct answer.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
