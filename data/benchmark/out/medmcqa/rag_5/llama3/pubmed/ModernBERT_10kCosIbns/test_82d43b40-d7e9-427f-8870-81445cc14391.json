["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the most posteriorly present foramen in the base of skull. From the given documents, we can analyze the structures of the base of the skull. In 'CT of the base of the skull', it is mentioned that the posterior migration of the foramen magnum contributes to its posterior position. The document 'Ontogenic growth changes of the skull base' also describes the posterior portion of the skull base exhibiting significant elongation as the mammalian evolutionary scale ascends, which directly contributes to the posterior migration of the foramen magnum. Therefore, we can deduce that the foramen magnum is the most posteriorly present foramen.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: All at same level\"\n}"]
