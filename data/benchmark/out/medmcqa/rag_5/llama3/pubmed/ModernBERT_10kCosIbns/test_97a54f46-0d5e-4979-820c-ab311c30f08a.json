["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, I will analyze the effects of exercise on cardiac output and contractility indices. The document 'Cardiac output and contractility indices: establishing a standard in response to low-to-moderate level exercise in healthy men' states that cardiac output during sitting, fully supported rest was slightly higher than that at 2METS on treadmill owing to higher stroke volume. From 2METS through 6METS the curvilinear mean heart rate and stroke volume were mirror images, producing a linear increase in mean cardiac output which at 6METS was 145% of basal and 160% of the 2MET value, while the contractility index increased to 217% of basal. This suggests that exercise increases cardiac output by increasing stroke volume.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C: ESV remain unchanged\"\n}"]
