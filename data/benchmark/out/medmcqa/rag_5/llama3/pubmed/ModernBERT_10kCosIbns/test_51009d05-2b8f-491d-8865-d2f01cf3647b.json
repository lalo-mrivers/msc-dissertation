["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"None of the relevant documents mention 'reverse bevel incision' or its purpose. However, since most surgical incisions require lengthening when retracted, it can be inferred that this type of incision is made to achieve a specific goal. The guidelines for placement of elective incisions suggest considering the direction of skin tension lines and wrinkles, but they do not provide information about the reverse bevel incision.
