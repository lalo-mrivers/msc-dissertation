["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about supracondylar fracture of the humerus. We need to look at the relevant documents provided. The first document discusses severe fractures of the lower end of the humerus in adults and mentions that there are 5 main types, including supracondylar fractures. However, it does not provide information about the characteristics of supracondylar fractures. The second document is about supracondylar fracture of the humerus in children and provides details about the long-term follow-up study. It states that rotational displacement and displacement in the frontal or sagittal plane remodelled by the end of the growth period, whereas tilting of the distal fragment into varus or valgus remained. This suggests that the distal segment can be dislocated anteriorly more than posterior. The question does not ask about children or long-term follow-up, but it provides a clue to answer option A. Option D is also possible as supracondylar fractures can cause weakness of elbow flexion.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
