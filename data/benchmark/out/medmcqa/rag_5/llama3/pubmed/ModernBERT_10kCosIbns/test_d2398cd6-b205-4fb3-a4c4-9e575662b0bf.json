["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about which option is not involved in iron metabolism. The relevant documents provided are related to iron bioavailability, dietary iron, and iron requirements. From the documents, it can be seen that ferrous sulfate was used as a reference standard for estimating iron bioavailability. Ferric citrate had a high relative biological value (96) compared to ferric orthophosphate (11). Heme iron has been defined and estimates of nonheme iron availability based on enhancing substances appear possible. Factors such as pH, oxidation potential, structure of food, and time of digestion affect iron bioavailability. The documents also mention studies on Bantu siderosis, hemochromatosis, and other overload pathologies, which provide insight into the intake and storage of iron. Based on this information, it can be concluded that ceruloplasmin is not involved in iron metabolism.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
