["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the provided documents, we can see that the volar fascicles of the interosseous muscles possess two separate components: the proximal and glenoidal one, and the distal and aponeurotic other. This implies that each finger has multiple interossei muscles, not just one or two. The document also describes the anatomy of the dorsal aponeurosis, which is made up of three types of reactions: gliding on the sides of the pyramid, displacement of axes of insertion and rotation of retinacular ligaments, and modifications of the way of transmission. This suggests that each finger has multiple interossei muscles that work together to produce movement. Therefore, we can infer that the little finger (which is mentioned in document [Extension of the fingers. III. Morphologic and structural study]) likely has two dorsal interossei.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
