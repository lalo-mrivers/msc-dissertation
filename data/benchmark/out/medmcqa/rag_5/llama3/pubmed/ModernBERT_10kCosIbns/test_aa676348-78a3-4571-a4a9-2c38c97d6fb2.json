["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the document 'Time-dependent deformation of some direct compression excipients', it is evident that decreasing the rate of loading can lead to time-dependent deformation. This suggests that the material may exhibit viscoelastic behavior, which means its mechanical properties change over time in response to changes in stress or strain.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
