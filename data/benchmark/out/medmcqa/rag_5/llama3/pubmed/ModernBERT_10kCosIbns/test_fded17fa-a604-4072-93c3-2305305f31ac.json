["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about sequencing for panfacial trauma. The first reduction and fixation would likely involve the most critical structures and bones to ensure proper alignment and stabilization. Panfacial trauma often involves multiple facial fractures, including those of the maxilla, zygoma, nasal, orbital, and ethmoid regions. Based on this information, it is reasonable to assume that the sequence should prioritize the most critical structures. The maxilla is a crucial structure that serves as a base for many other facial bones. Fixation of the maxilla would provide a stable foundation for further reconstruction. Therefore, the step-by-step thinking leads me to choose option D: First can be any of the above but it should end with maxilla.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
