["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to the documents provided, occlusal interferences are related to neuromuscular or temporomandibular articulation dysfunction. The harmony of the occlusal components of the teeth, mandibular joint and muscles is important for normal function. The presence of disharmony at median occlusal position (MOP) can cause pain-dysfunction of the masticatory system. In one study, patients with histories of functional disturbances of the masticatory system had prolonged EMG silent periods and muscle incoordination with mandibular dysfunction, which suggests a link between occlusal interferences and nervous tension. This information is consistent with the concept that occlusal interferences can trigger bruxism.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
