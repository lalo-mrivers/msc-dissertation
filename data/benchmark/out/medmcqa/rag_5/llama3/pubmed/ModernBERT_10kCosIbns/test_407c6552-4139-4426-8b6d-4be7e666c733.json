["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about a material that speeds up a chemical reaction without chemically becoming involved. This means the material is not reacting with the reactants or products of the reaction. The relevant documents mention enzyme-catalysed reactions, biocatalytic methods, and designing enzyme-like catalysts. These suggest that enzymes can catalyze reactions without being chemically involved. Therefore, we can infer that a catalyst is a material that speeds up a chemical reaction without becoming involved in the chemical process.\", \"answer_choice\": C}"]
