["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the tooth with bifurcated roots. The relevant documents are Topographical characteristics of root trunk length related to guided tissue regeneration, Submergence of roots for alveolar bone preservation, Root formation in ectopically transplanted teeth of the frog, Rana pipiens I. Tooth morphogenesis, and [The anatomical characteristics of the root furcations in the molar teeth]. The only document that mentions bifurcated roots is [The anatomical characteristics of the root furcations in the molar teeth], which states that 'the second upper molar is the most frequently extracted tooth'. This implies that the second upper molar has a complex root structure, including bifurcation. Therefore, the answer is likely to be related to this document.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
