["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The study records the sale of anti-asthma drugs over a period of 15 years (1975-1990) and measures the number of deaths due to asthma. This suggests that the study is examining a population or group, rather than individual patients. The outcome variable is death from asthma, which is likely correlated with the exposure variable (sale of anti-asthma drugs). This type of study design allows for the examination of temporal trends in both variables.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
