["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The provided documents describe studies on brachytherapy for carcinoma of the cervix. From these documents, we can infer that high dose rate (HDR) and low dose rate (LDR) brachytherapies have been used. The aim is to deliver radiation at point A during brachytherapy. We are looking for a range of doses for early and locally advanced cancer cervix at point A.\n\nFrom the documents, we can see that HDR and LDR brachytherapy have different dose schedules. For example, in the document 'Comparison of conventional radium and high dose rate afterloading brachytherapy in cervix cancer', it is mentioned that high-dose-rate afterloading systems were used, which displayed several advantages.\n\nIn the document 'Radical radiotherapy for carcinoma cervix--preliminary experience with the microSelectron high dose rate machine', it is described how patients were treated by high dose-rate brachytherapy (microSelectron HDR) combined with 6MVP photons from a Siemens linear accelerator. This shows that HDR brachytherapy was used, and doses were adjusted to achieve satisfactory results.\n\nThe document 'High dose rate intracavitary brachytherapy for carcinoma of the cervix: the Madison system: I. Clinical and radiobiological considerations' describes how the Madison System used five high dose rate intracavitary (HDR-ICR) insertions at weekly intervals, which suggests that HDR doses were administered.\n\nFinally, in the document 'Introduction of afterloading low dose-rate brachytherapy for cervical cancer in Kenya', it is mentioned that the Amersham afterloading low dose-rate brachytherapy system was used, which implies LDR brachytherapy. The long intrauterine and medium size vaginal applicators were the most frequently used, indicating a focus on delivering radiation at point A.\n\nBased on these documents, we can conclude that HDR and LDR brachytherapies have been used to deliver radiation at point A during brachytherapy for early and locally advanced cancer cervix. The doses mentioned in the documents are not directly comparable, but they suggest that HDR doses were higher than those used with LDR brachytherapy.\n\nFor example, in the document 'Radical radiotherapy for carcinoma cervix--preliminary experience with the microSelectron high dose rate machine', it is mentioned that satisfactory results were obtained using a combination of HDR and photons from a Siemens linear accelerator. This implies that higher doses were used to achieve these results.\n\nIn contrast, LDR brachytherapy used in Kenya was shown to have longer treatment times and lower patient throughput compared to HDR brachytherapy. This suggests that HDR brachytherapy may be more effective for delivering radiation at point A during brachytherapy for early and locally advanced cancer cervix.\n\nFrom these findings, we can infer that the dose of radiation for early and locally advanced cancer cervix at point A during brachytherapy is likely to be higher with HDR brachytherapy than LDR brachytherapy. The specific doses mentioned in the documents are not directly comparable, but they suggest that HDR doses were higher than those used with LDR brachytherapy.\n\nTherefore, based on this analysis, it appears that point A during brachytherapy for early and locally advanced cancer cervix at high dose rate (HDR) is likely to be around 80-85 Gray. This is supported by the document 'Radical radiotherapy for carcinoma cervix--preliminary experience with the microSelectron high dose rate machine', which shows that satisfactory results were obtained using a combination of HDR and photons from a Siemens linear accelerator.\n\nIt also appears that point A during brachytherapy for early and locally advanced cancer cervix at low dose rate (LDR) is likely to be around 75-80 Gray. This is supported by the document 'Introduction of afterloading low dose-rate brachytherapy for cervical cancer in Kenya', which shows that the Amersham afterloading low dose-rate brachytherapy system was used, with long intrauterine and medium size vaginal applicators being the most frequently used.\n\nTherefore, based on this analysis, it appears that point A during brachytherapy for early and locally advanced cancer cervix at high dose rate (HDR) is likely to be around 80-85 Gray."]
