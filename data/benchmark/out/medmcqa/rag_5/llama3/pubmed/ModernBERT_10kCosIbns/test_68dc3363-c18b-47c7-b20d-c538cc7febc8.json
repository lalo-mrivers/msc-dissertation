["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, we can start by looking at the clinical and histologic features of pigmented nevi. According to 'Pigmented nevi of the oral mucosa: a clinicopathologic study of 32 new cases and review of 75 cases from the literature. Part I. A clinicopathologic study of 32 new cases.', the most common type of nevus was found to be the intramucosal, followed in decreasing order by the common blue nevus, compound nevus, and junctional nevus. This suggests that the location of pigmented nevi may vary depending on the type. However, we can also look at specific studies about intraoral junctional nevi. According to 'Intraoral junctional nevus: review of the literature and report of case.', junctional nevi are extremely rare, accounting for approximately 4% of reported intraoral nevi. This study does not specify a particular location for these nevi, but it does suggest that wide surgical excision is recommended for all pigmented lesions within the oral cavity, regardless of their appearance or location. Finally, we can look at 'Multiple focal pigmented lesions in the maxillary tuberosity and hard palate: a unique display of intraoral junctional nevi.' This study reports on a patient with multiple intraoral junctional nevi located on the maxillary tuberosity and hard palate. While this is an unusual case, it suggests that junctional nevi can occur at multiple locations within the oral cavity.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
