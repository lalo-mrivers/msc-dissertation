["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"FEV1 and FVC are values mentioned in the provided documents. FEV1 is a measure of pulmonary function, and FVC is forced vital capacity. To calculate the FEV1/FVC ratio, I would need to look at the values given for FEV1 and FVC in the patient's spirometry curve. The documents do not provide this information, so I will rely on general knowledge that a normal FEV1/FVC ratio is typically around 70-80%. However, without specific data from the patient's spirometry curve, it would be difficult to make an accurate calculation.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
