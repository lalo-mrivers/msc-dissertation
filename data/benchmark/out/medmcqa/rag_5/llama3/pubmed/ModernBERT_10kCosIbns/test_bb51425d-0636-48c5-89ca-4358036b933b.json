["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the effect of multiple firing on an opaque layer of dental porcelain. According to the document 'Viscosity of dental porcelain as a function of temperature', thermal history of the porcelain is shown to be important only over a relatively small temperature interval in affecting residual stresses.
