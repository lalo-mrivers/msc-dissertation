["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents mention that the most common site of mandibular fracture resulting from altercation is the angle (39.1%), which implies that the proximal segment of mandibular angle fracture may be displaced in a certain direction. The documents also mention that assaults most frequently caused fracture of the angle of the mandible, which suggests that the direction of displacement may be related to the mechanism of injury. Based on this information, we can infer that the direction of displacement is likely to be posterior and superior.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
