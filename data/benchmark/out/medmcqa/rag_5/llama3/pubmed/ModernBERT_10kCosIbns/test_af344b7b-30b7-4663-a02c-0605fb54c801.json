["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"There are several documents related to blood storage. The first document discusses the use of heparin solution as an anticoagulant for storing dried blood specimens. However, it does not mention storing blood for 35 days. The second document discusses the effect of various anticoagulants on the mean corpuscular volume (MCV) of blood after storage. It does not provide information about storing blood for 35 days.\n\nThe third document describes a new anticoagulant solution for canine blood that allows for up to 6 weeks of storage at 4Â°C. This is close, but still short of 35 days. The fourth document discusses the quality of blood used for transfusion and the importance of removing non-red cell elements from stored blood.\n\nAfter reviewing these documents, it appears that there is no specific anticoagulant mentioned as being suitable for storing blood for 35 days. Therefore, I must rely on general information about anticoagulants to provide an answer.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
