["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The provided documents describe the blood circulation of the tongue, morphofunctional characteristics of the accessory structures of the cat lingual receptors, development of the accessory apparatus of the chemosensitive structures of the rat tongue during ontogenesis, and ultrastructure of the nerve endings in the rat tongue mucosa. To answer this question, I will look for information about the sensory nerve fibers supplying the posterior one-third of the tongue. According to Frog's tongue receptive areas: neural organization and gustatory function, the lateral branch of the IXth nerve innervates the rostral third of the tongue surface, while the medial branch innervates the caudal two-thirds, including the posterior one-third. Therefore, I will choose option B.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
