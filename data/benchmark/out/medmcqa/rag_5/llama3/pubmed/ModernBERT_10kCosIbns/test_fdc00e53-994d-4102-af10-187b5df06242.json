["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"In a polytrauma patient with sudden drainage of 1,500 mL blood from the left side, the immediate concern is to ensure that the patient is hemodynamically stable and not bleeding excessively. Since oxygen saturation is still 92%, it's unlikely that the patient is in severe hemorrhagic shock. Considering the possibility of a ruptured diaphragm or a massive hematothorax, which are common complications in thoracic trauma (as mentioned in 'Dangers of Thoracic Drainage'), I would suggest auscultating for left chest breath sounds to confirm the presence of lung tissue and waiting for saturation to rise. This approach will allow me to assess the patient's respiratory status before making any further decisions.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C\n}"]
