["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents provide information on frequency range. In the 'Frequency discrimination for pulsed versus modulated tones' document, it is mentioned that estimates of frequency discrimination were obtained by 11 observers at 350, 500, 1000, 4000, and 8000 Hz. This suggests that the sonic frequency range includes at least these frequencies. Additionally, the 'Pitch ratings of harmonic series' document mentions that when the components of a harmonic series are of equal amplitude, pitch ratings are determined almost exclusively by the fundamental frequency of the series. Only by extreme modification of the amplitudes of the several components was it possible to modify the pitch ratings assigned to the harmonic series in a direction opposite to that determined by the fundamental frequency. This implies that frequencies above 1000 Hz may also be included in the sonic frequency range. Therefore, based on these hints, we can infer that the sonic frequency range is likely to be broad and extend beyond 10,000 Hz.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
