["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the various complications and manifestations of primary Sjogren's syndrome. We need to focus on the salivary gland output in these patients. The [Neurologic complications of primary Sjogren's syndrome] document does not provide information about salivary gland output, so we move on to other documents. The [Vascular endothelium and lymphocyte adhesion molecules in minor salivary glands of patients with Sjogren's syndrome] study examines the distribution and types of adhesion molecules expressed over endothelial cells and the ligands present on lymphocytes which infiltrate exocrine glands in patients with Sjogren's syndrome. There is no mention of salivary gland output. The [Sjogren's syndrome in SLE: Part I] study finds clinical features of Sjogren's syndrome in 31 percent of 32 patients with SLE, but does not provide information about salivary gland output. The [Primed and naive helper T cells in labial glands from patients with Sjogren's syndrome] study examines the presence and distribution of B cells, T cells, and T-cell subsets within labial glands of patients with primary Sjogren's syndrome, but does not provide information about salivary gland output. Finally, [The manifestations of the nervous system in primary Sjogren syndrome] reports 9 cases of primary Sjogren syndrome who were complicated with nervous system involvement, but again, there is no mention of salivary gland output.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
