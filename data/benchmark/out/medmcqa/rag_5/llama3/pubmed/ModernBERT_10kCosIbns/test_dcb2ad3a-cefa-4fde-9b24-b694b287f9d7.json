["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the management of transverse symphyseal fracture of mandible. The relevant documents suggest that closed reduction and intermaxillary fixation are commonly used for fractures of the mandible in children. However, this approach may not be suitable for all types of fractures, especially those with severe comminution or a mobile central fragment. Open reduction and internal fixation may be required in such cases. The options provided include different plate and screw combinations that can be used for fixation. Based on the information available, lag screws are unlikely to be suitable for managing transverse symphyseal fracture of mandible.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
