["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about an advantage of mediolateral episiotomy over midline episiotomy. We need to look for the relevant documents that compare these two methods. In the first document, it is mentioned that 'the complication rate following mediolateral episiotomy is higher than following median episiotomy including the complication rate with extensions into the rectum.' This suggests that mediolateral episiotomy has a higher chance of extension compared to midline episiotomy. The opposite of this statement would be an advantage of mediolateral episiotomy, which is less chance of extension. Therefore, option A is correct.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
