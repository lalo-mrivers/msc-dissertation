["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 26-year-old female with mild pain in the lower abdomen. She has had two full-term normal deliveries earlier, indicating that she is likely fertile. The palpable mass in the adnexa and the USG pelvis showing a 5 cm ovarian cyst suggest a possible ovarian pathology.
