["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the binding of Eukaryotic mRNA to Ribosomes. From the provided documents, we can see that ribosomes select initiator regions in mRNA through base pair formation between the 3' terminus of 16S rRNA and the mRNA during initiation of protein synthesis in Escherichia coli. This suggests that the 3' end of 16S RNA base pairs with the polypurine stretch common to initiator regions in E. coli and bacteriophage mRNAs. There is no mention of capping, poly-A tail, tRNA or Shine-Dalgarno sequence in this process. Therefore, the answer must be related to the interaction between mRNA and 16S rRNA.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
