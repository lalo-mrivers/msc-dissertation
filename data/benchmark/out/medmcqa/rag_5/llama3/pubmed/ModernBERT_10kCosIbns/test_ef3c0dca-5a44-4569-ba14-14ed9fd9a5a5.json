["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the provided documents, it can be seen that glucose is absorbed from the small intestine lumen into the enterocyte through a diffusive pathway (Contribution of diffusive pathway in intestinal absorption of glucose in rat under normal feeding condition). This suggests that simple diffusion (C) is one way for glucose to transport in the intestine. Additionally, regulation of glucose transport in response to nutritional stimuli involves mechanisms at the brush-border membrane and basolateral membrane of the enterocyte (Regulation of intestinal glucose transport), which also supports the idea of simple diffusion.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
