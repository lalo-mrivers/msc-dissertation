["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant document is 'Microscopical aspects of root resorption of human deciduous teeth'. The passage describes the stages of physiological root resorption. It states that during the early stage of resorption, linear resorption and redeposition of hard tissue are more pronounced. In contrast, lacunar resorption is more prominent at the late stage. At this stage, there are haemorrhagic and inflammatory infiltrates within the pulp, indicating a response to the process of resorption. This suggests that the dental pulp is actively involved in the process of root resorption.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
