["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks for complications of supracondylar fracture of the humerus in children, except one. The provided documents describe the common results and treatments of this type of fracture. Supracondylar fractures can result in posterior and medial displacement of the distal fragment, rotational displacement, and tilting of the distal fragment into varus or valgus. Rotational displacement and displacement in the frontal or sagittal plane remodelled by the end of the growth period, whereas tilting of the distal fragment into varus or valgus remained.\n\nComplications mentioned in the documents include neuropathies, ischemia, technical failures with angular deformities, brachial artery damage, and compartment syndrome. Myositis ossificans is not explicitly mentioned as a complication in these documents.\n\nThe correct answer choice is B: Myositis ossificans.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
