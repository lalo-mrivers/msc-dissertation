["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the mechanism of dry heat destruction of microorganisms. The relevant documents are about human body heat exchange with environment, calorimetry, and climatic conditions. There is no direct mention of microorganism destruction by dry heat. However, we can infer that dry heat refers to convective heat transfer (heat loss via evaporation), which is one of the forms of heat exchange mentioned in the documents. This form of heat transfer is important for maintaining human body temperature and is affected by environmental conditions such as air velocity and water vapor pressure.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
