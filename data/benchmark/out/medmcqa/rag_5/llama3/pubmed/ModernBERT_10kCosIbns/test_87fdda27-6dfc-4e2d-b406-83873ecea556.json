["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe treatment options for haemophilia B. The study [A controlled study of long-term treatment of haemophilia B on an out-patient basis (author's transl)] suggests that the ideal dosage scheme is twice 9 U/kg weekly, which led to a significant reduction in bleeding episodes. Another study [Prophylactic replacement therapy in hemophilia. A case report (author's transl)] also recommends prophylactic substitution of factor VIII with a dosage of 18 U/kg body-weight given three times a week. Based on these studies, it is likely that the ideal dosage for surgery would be similar to this regimen. Therefore, we can infer that the recommended rate for factor replacement in a haemophilia B patient undergoing major surgery would be around 18-27 units/kg every 24 hours.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
