["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the need for non-working contact in different dental restorations. Non-working contact refers to the relationship between two surfaces that don't make contact when the teeth or dentures are closed. Based on the given documents, none of them provide direct information about dental restorations or the need for non-working contact.\n\nHowever, we can analyze each option:\n\nA: Natural dentition - This is the natural state of human teeth and does not require any restoration or prosthesis that would involve non-working contacts.\n\nB: Complete denture - A complete denture replaces all missing teeth in an arch. It requires a specific arrangement to ensure proper function, including working contacts between adjacent artificial teeth.\n\nC: Distal extension RPDs - A distal extension removable partial denture (RPD) is a type of dental prosthesis that covers multiple teeth. It may require non-working contact surfaces, depending on the design and placement of the RPD.\n\nConsidering these points, the correct answer is C: Distal extension RPDs\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"]
