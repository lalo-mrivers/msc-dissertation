["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant document that discusses the residual mercury content is [Toxicological implications of amalgams]. According to this document, it states that 'the amount of mercury vapour from amalgam restoration achieves--not even in adverse conditions--the quarter of the daily mercury intake by food.' This implies that the residual mercury content is relatively low. Therefore, we can infer that the correct answer choice is below 25%. Another relevant document is [Effectiveness of oxide films in reducing mercury release from amalgams], which states that 'mercury release was reduced to a negligible level within three to four hours after trituration.' This further supports our initial inference that the residual mercury content is low.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
