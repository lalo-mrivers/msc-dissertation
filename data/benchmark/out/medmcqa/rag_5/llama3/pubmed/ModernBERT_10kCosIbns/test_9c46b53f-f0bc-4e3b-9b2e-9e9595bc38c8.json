["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the ratio of polymer to monomer in cold cure resin. Since the documents provided are related to dental resins, we can consider the relevant information from [Aging effect on mechanical properties in fluid resin. (Part 1). Affection of residual monomer (author's transl)] and [On the polymerization of pour type resin (author's transl)]. The first document discusses the amount of residual monomer in a fluid resin, which must be mainly at the surface. This suggests that the ratio of polymer to monomer can be affected by the conditions under which the resin is cured.\n\nThe second document provides information on the polymerization process of pour type resins. It mentions that the initial polymerization point and the polymerization progress have been observed on powder-liquid pour type acrylic resin. This implies that the ratio of polymer to monomer can change during the curing process, depending on factors such as temperature, pressure, and composition.\n\nBased on this information, we can infer that the ratio of polymer to monomer in cold cure resin may not be a fixed value, but rather it can vary depending on the conditions under which the resin is cured. Therefore, we cannot pinpoint a specific ratio that applies universally to all cold cure resins.\", \"answer_choice\": C}"]
