["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the statistics used to check out the mean of values. After reviewing the provided documents, I can see that there are multiple approaches mentioned for analyzing different types of data, but none of them explicitly mention checking out the mean of values. However, one document discusses fitting growth curve models to longitudinal data with missing observations, which suggests a parametric approach. Another paper describes alternative approaches to the analysis of binary and categorical repeated measurements, which implies non-parametric methods. Based on this information, I can infer that the correct answer would be an empirical method that doesn't necessarily involve checking the mean directly.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
