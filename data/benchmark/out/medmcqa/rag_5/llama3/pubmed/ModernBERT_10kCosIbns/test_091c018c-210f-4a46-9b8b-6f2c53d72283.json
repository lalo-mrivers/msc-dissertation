["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for features of benign intracranial hypertension that are NOT present. Benign intracranial hypertension is characterized by increased intracranial pressure without localizing signs, papilledema, and headache. According to the provided documents, most patients with benign intracranial hypertension have normal mental status, negative brain scan, and normal electroencephalogram. The document also states that no patient with a normal mental status, negative brain scan, and normal electroencephalogram was found subsequently to harbor a mass lesion. Therefore, we can conclude that proptosis is not a feature of benign intracranial hypertension because it would imply the presence of a mass lesion. Normal size ventricles are also mentioned in one of the documents as a characteristic of benign intracranial hypertension. Headache and papilledema are well-established symptoms of this condition. Therefore, proptosis is the correct answer.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
