["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents provide information about deciduous teeth containing histories of developmental disturbances, tooth ontogeny in the upper jaw and tongue of rainbow trout, a step function model using tooth counts to assess developmental timing, clinical, histologic and micro-radiographic study of natal, neonatal and pre-erupted teeth, and tooth morphogenesis.
