["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Calcium hydroxide pulpotomy is a procedure that involves filling a tooth pulp cavity with calcium hydroxide. The study [Effect of calciumhydroxide and its modified forms] states that the singular physicochemical properties which give calcium hydroxide a special place in dentistry only apply to water-containing pastes. With organic hardeners, setting preparations based on 'calcium hydroxide' do not have this property and cannot replace water-containing pastes of calcium hydroxide. This implies that the calcium hydroxide used in the pulpotomy procedure is likely to react with the surrounding tissue, releasing calcium ions which can then form a calcific bridge. Therefore, it is likely that the source of calcium ions of a calcific bridge in a tooth after calcium hydroxide pulpotomy is from the calcium hydroxide itself.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
