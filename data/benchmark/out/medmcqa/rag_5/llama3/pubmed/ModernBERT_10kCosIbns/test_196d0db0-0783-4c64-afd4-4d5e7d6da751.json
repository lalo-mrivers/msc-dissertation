["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Upon reviewing the provided documents, I noticed that the 'Aesthetic Analysis of the Face' discusses facial proportions and harmony, but it does not specifically mention segmenting the face into a certain number of segments. The 'Biostereometric Analysis of Surgically Corrected Abnormal Faces' mentions a coordinate system for quantifying geometric changes of facial form, but it does not address facial proportions or segmentation. The 'Proportional Analysis of Soft Tissue Facial Profile in Young Adults with Normal Occlusion' discusses soft tissue profile analysis and norms for 11 indices expressing vertical and horizontal soft tissue proportions of the face, but again, it does not mention segmenting the face into a certain number of segments. Therefore, I will focus on the 'British and West African Facial Form in Ideal Occlusion', which presents a facial polygon joining the points Nasion, Sella, Articulare, Gonion, and Menton. This suggests that the face is divided into at least 5 segments.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
