["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the articular disc of TMJ. We need to find relevant information from the provided documents to determine the correct answer. From the first document 'Observation of the Articular Disc', we can see that there is no mention of lateral pterygoid contributing to the strength of the disc. The second and third documents discuss gross anatomy, collagen fiber orientation, and biomechanical properties of TMJ discs in dogs and human hands, but they do not provide information about the thickness or structure of the articular disc in humans. However, from the fourth document 'Neural Elements in the Human Temporomandibular Articular Disc', we can infer that the population density of neural elements is greatest at the periphery and progressively decreases towards the center, which could imply that the disc might be thicker posteriorly. Therefore, we cannot conclude with certainty about the thickness or structure of the articular disc in humans. However, based on the available information, it seems more plausible that the disc might be thicker posteriorly.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
