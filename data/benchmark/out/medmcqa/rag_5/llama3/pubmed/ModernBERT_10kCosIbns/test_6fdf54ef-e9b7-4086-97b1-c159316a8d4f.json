["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to the document 'Stimulation of peripheral blood T cells by an activated T-cell line', we can see that activated T-cell clones stimulated the proliferation of resting T cells mainly through a mechanism involving cell-to-cell contact. This suggests that activated T cells can activate naive T cells. The document also mentions that some activated T cells, probably by expression of a surface molecule, can stimulate resting T cells thereby allowing for antigen-non-specific augmentation of the immune response. Therefore, it is likely that naive T cells get activated by other activated T cells.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
