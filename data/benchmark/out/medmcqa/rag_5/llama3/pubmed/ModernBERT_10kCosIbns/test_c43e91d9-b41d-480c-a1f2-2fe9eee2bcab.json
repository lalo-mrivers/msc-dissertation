["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about cholesterol crystals in apical periodontitis lesions. The relevant documents are studies on apical border plaque in chronic adult periodontitis, the pathomorphology of chronic apical periodontitis, identification of osteoclasts and their mononuclear precursors, and alveolar bone remodeling in experimental apical periodontitis.
