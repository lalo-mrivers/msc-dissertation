["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the given documents, we know that the periodontal ligament is a type of tissue that connects the tooth to the surrounding bone. The document 'Morphology of neural endings in the human periodontal ligament: an electron microscopic study' describes three types of nerve endings found in the periodontal ligament: free nerve endings, Ruffini-like endings and lamellated corpuscles. None of these descriptions mention fibers embedded in the bone. The document 'Bovine periodontal ligament. An investigation of the collagen, glycosaminoglycan and insoluble glycoprotein components at different stages of tissue development' does not provide any information about fibers embedded in the bone either. The document 'In vitro strength of the human periodontal ligament' only discusses the tensile properties of the periodontal ligament and does not mention fibers embedded in the bone. Finally, the document 'The structure and functions of the dentogingival junction and periodontal ligament' describes the unique functions of the dentogingival junction and periodontal ligament but does not provide any information about fibers embedded in the bone. Therefore, we can rule out all options except one which is...\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
