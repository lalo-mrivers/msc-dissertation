["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant document for this question is 'Heterogeneity of motor units activating single Golgi tendon organs in cat leg muscles'. This study examined the properties of motor units that activate a given Golgi tendon organ. The results showed that the motor units which were found to activate a given tendon organ had contractile properties dispersed over the same range as those of the whole muscle population. There is no information about high threshold, dynamic response only or detects length change in this study. However, it is mentioned that an individual Golgi tendon organ can signal the contraction of motor units with different physiological properties.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
