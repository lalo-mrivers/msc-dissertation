["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the most sensitive test for nitrous oxide detection to prevent toxicity in office personnel. From the provided documents, we can see that there is a concern about occupational exposure to nitrous oxide and its potential health risks. Nitrous oxide reacts with vitamin B12, which may lead to non-anesthetic-related adverse effects. To assess environmental health concerns, monitoring of nitrous oxide concentrations is necessary. The document 'Nitrous oxide levels in operating room air with various gas flows' discusses the use of an infra-red analyzer for measuring nitrous oxide concentrations. This suggests that infrared technology could be used for detection.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
