["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to the provided documents, the thermal behavior of gypsum-bonded investments is discussed. Specifically, the document '[Thermal behavior of gypsum bonded investments. (Part I) Thermal behavior in heating process(author's transl)]' explains that the dehydration of gypsum causes the first shrinkage between 100 degrees C and 200 degrees C, while the transformation of soluble anhydrite to insoluble anhydrite causes the second shrinkage between 300 degrees C and 400 degrees C. The third shrinkage is considered to be related to the sintering of insoluble anhydrite. Therefore, it can be inferred that the thermal expansion of the investment increases with temperature. This information suggests that a thinner mix of the gypsum-bonded investment will not significantly affect its thermal expansion.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
