["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about excessive occlusal forces. The relevant documents describe changes that may occur in an occlusion due to instability, including both horizontal and vertical changes. Horizontal changes can be accommodated, while vertical changes require more extensive treatment. Muscle deconditioning is also discussed as a factor in occlusal corrective procedures. The concept of median occlusal position (MOP) is mentioned as being important for harmony within the biologic range.\n\nGiven this information, it seems that excessive occlusal forces can be superimposed in cases where there are vertical changes in the occlusion, which require a more extensive treatment procedure. This would not apply to normal periodontium with normal or reduced height of bone, as these conditions do not suggest vertical changes.\n\nThe other options (marginal periodontitis) imply some degree of damage or instability that could lead to excessive occlusal forces being superimposed.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
