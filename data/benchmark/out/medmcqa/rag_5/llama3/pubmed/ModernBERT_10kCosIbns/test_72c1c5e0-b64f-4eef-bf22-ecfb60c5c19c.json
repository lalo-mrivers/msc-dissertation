["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about a low insulin to glucagon ratio. We can analyze the given documents to identify situations where this ratio is normal or abnormal. In general, a high concentration of circulating insulin suppresses the glucagon response to hypoglycemia. This is seen in normal individuals and also in type I diabetic patients. However, in adult-onset diabetics, the glucose-induced decline in IRG (immunoreactive glucagon) was normal despite a subnormal glucose-induced insulin rise. Similarly, in juvenile-type diabetics, basal IRG levels were normal following overnight insulin infusion, but the glucose-induced IRG decline was only half that of nondiabetics. However, it became normal when hyperinsulinemia was acutely produced by supplementary insulin. This suggests that a low insulin to glucagon ratio is not typically seen in these situations.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
