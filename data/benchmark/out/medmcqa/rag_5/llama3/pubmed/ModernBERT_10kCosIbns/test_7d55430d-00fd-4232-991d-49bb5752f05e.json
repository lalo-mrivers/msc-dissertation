["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks which cell releases a vasoactive amine to increase vascular permeability. We can start by looking at the documents provided. In the article 'Structural aspects of the permeability of the microvascular endothelium', it is mentioned that substances that stimulate EDRF release from arterial endothelium also increase venular microvessel permeability. This suggests that endothelial cells may play a role in increasing vascular permeability. Furthermore, in the article 'Modulation of venular microvessel permeability by calcium influx into endothelial cells', it is mentioned that substances that increase permeability stimulate EDRF release from arterial endothelium and increase venular microvessel permeability. This further supports the idea that endothelial cells may be involved in increasing vascular permeability.\n\nIn the article 'Signals regulating arterial vasomotricity and vasotrophicity', it is mentioned that the arterial cyclic GMP pathway is predominantly under control of the endothelial function to secrete NO rather than influenced by the atrial natriuretic factor. This suggests that endothelial cells may have a role in controlling vascular permeability.\n\nTherefore, based on these findings, it seems likely that endothelial cells are involved in releasing vasoactive amine to increase vascular permeability.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
