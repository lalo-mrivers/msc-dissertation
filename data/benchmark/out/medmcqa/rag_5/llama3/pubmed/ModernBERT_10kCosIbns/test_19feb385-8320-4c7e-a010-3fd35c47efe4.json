["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The concept of pattern in craniofacial growth does not seem relevant to this question. The document on ergonomic analysis of the results of radial keratotomy is also not directly related. The study on three-dimensional measuring system for the human face mentions facial coordinates, but it's a measurement system and doesn't provide information about angles between different facial lines. The quantification of error in measurement of radial inclination angle and radial-carpal distance provides some context about radiographic measurements, but it's not directly related to rake face or radial line. Therefore, the most relevant document is 'The directions of static skin tensions in the face: their roles in facial incisions', which discusses the shape and orientation of facial skin tensions.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
