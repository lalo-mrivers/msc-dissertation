["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about 'eburnation' of the dentine. Eburnation is a term used to describe the process of hollowing out or destruction of the peritubular dentin. This can be seen in the study on Experimental erosion of dentin, where it was observed that longer times of immersion resulted in hollowing of the tubular openings by complete destruction of the peritubular dentin. Considering this information, it is likely that eburnation of the dentine would be seen in a lesion associated with erosion or acid damage. Options A to D do not explicitly mention erosion or acid damage, but option C 'Arrested caries' could potentially include erosion.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
