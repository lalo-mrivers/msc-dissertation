["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe glucose determination methods using different enzymes, such as glucose dehydrogenase or glucose oxidase. The chemical structure of glucose is not explicitly mentioned. However, the method comparison and specificity tests in the documents suggest that glucose can be classified as a ketose sugar (C-4 epimer). This information is provided in the [Investigation of a new method for the determination of glucose, using the Greiner Selective Analyzer II (GSA II) (author's transl)] document. The other options do not seem to relate directly to biochemical descriptions of glucose.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A: Exists as ketose sugar\""]
