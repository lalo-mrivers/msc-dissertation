["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents discuss the morphology of mandibular premolars. The first study mentions that 15.7% of patients had at least one premolar tooth with either divided canals or roots, and it does not specify the ethnicity. Another study discusses the root canal configuration of mandibular first premolars and notes that an interesting finding was the number of C-shaped canals which were associated predominantly with Type IV canal systems, occurring in 14% of the roots. There is no information provided about Africa or Caucasians. Therefore, based on the available data, it seems reasonable to conclude that multiple canals in mandibular premolars are not specific to any particular ethnicity.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
