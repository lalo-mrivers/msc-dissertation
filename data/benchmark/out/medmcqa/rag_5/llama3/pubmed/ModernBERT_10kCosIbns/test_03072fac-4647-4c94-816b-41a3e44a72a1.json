["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents discuss the formation of cementum on roots and its association with bone regeneration. In the first document, it is mentioned that cementum covered the cut end of submerged roots, making the end similar to a normal apex. This suggests that cementum can form on roots. The second document discusses the revascularization process of pulp tissue after tooth replantation or autotransplantation and mentions the formation of anastomoses between pulpal vessels. This suggests that blood vessels can grow into pulp tissue. The third document describes the resorption of deciduous teeth, including the deposition of cementum against secondary dentine. It also discusses the formation of odontoblastic processes protruding above the resected surface of a root after apicoectomy. These findings collectively suggest that cementum and bone can form on roots over time.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
