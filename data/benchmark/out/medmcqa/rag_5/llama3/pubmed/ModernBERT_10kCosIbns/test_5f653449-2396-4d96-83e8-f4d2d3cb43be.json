["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the process of transfer of information from RNA to proteins. In the provided documents, it can be seen that the process of translation is mentioned as a step where activated transcriptons produce pre-mRNA and these primary transcripts are processed into secondary pre-mRNA's by extragenic cleavage and intragenic ('splicing') processing, giving rise stepwise to functional mRNA. Finally, translation yields either potentially functional polypeptides or polycistronic polyproteins subject to further processing.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
