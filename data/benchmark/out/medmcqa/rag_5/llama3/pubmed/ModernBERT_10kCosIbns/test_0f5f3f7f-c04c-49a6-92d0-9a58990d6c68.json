["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents suggest that death due to smoke inhalation is related to severe respiratory distress. The first document mentions that patients with severe injuries have a mortality rate of 30% to 50%, and the third document recommends steroids administration 'forthwith' in substantial doses if evidence of this respiratory syndrome appears, suggesting that rapid progression of the injury can lead to death.
