["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe cardiolipin as a specific phospholipid of mitochondria. It is mentioned that the enzyme cardiolipin synthase requires CO2+ for activity and has an alkaline pH optimum (pH 8-9). The document 'Turnover of fatty acids in rat liver cardiolipin: comparison with other mitochondrial phospholipids' suggests that the half-life of acyl moieties of cardiolipin is ca. 20% higher than that of the same components of other mitochondrial phospholipids. There is no information about the location of cardiolipin in the inner mitochondrial membrane, its role in apoptosis or its chemical structure. Therefore, we can conclude that cardiolipin is Diphosphatidyl glycerol and has choline base which has labile methyl group.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
