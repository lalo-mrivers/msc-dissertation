["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents describe the effects of various substances on ACh release. The Termination of transmitter release by stimulation of sodium-potassium activated ATPase document suggests that removal of external K ions increases ACh release. In contrast, substitution of Rb+ for K+ reduces ACh release. This implies that K channels play a role in regulating ACh release. Therefore, an increase in ACh release would be caused by blocking K channels on the presynaptic neuron.\", \"answer_choice\": D}"]
