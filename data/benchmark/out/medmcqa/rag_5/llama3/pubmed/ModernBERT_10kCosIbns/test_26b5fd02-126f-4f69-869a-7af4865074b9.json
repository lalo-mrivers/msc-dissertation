["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the endo-cochlear potential. Based on the provided documents, electrocochleography (ECoG) involves the recording of electrical responses to sound from the vicinity of the cochlea. The technique utilizes a trans-tympanic recording needle situated on the promontory of the middle ear. Filtered clicks in the frequency range between 500 and 8,000 Hz are presented to the ear under test at a rate of 10/sec. Repetitive clicks of a given frequency are first presented at high intensity and the responses summed (averaged) in a computer. The click is systematically lowered in intensity, and an average is collected at each level until the normal dynamic range of hearing has been explored.\n\nTwo major electrical indices are present in the recording: these are 1. the whole-nerve action potential (AP) derived from the first-order auditory neurons, and 2. the cochlear microphonic (CM) derived from the hair cells. Inspection of the whole nerve AP as intensity is lowered allows the estimation of the response threshold, which correlates well with behavioral threshold.\n\nNo specific information about endo-cochlear potential is provided in these documents. However, we can conclude that electrocochleography does not directly measure the endo-cochlear potential because it records electrical responses to sound from the vicinity of the cochlea, and not specifically from the endo-cochlear space.\n\nConsidering this information, we can infer that the endo-cochlear potential is not explicitly mentioned in these documents. Therefore, we cannot determine its value based on the provided information.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: Not specified (or none of the above)\""]
