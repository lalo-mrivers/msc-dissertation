["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The main purpose of tracheostomy is to bypass life-threatening obstructions of the upper airway or facilitate surgical procedures in the head and neck region. This suggests that tracheostomy aims to improve respiratory function, not impede it. Additionally, complications mentioned include obstruction of the tube or stoma, which would be exacerbated by an increase in dead air space (A). The use of low-pressure cuffs during tracheostomy also indicates a focus on preventing complications rather than increasing respiratory resistance (B) or decreasing respiratory work (C). Therefore, considering the context and potential complications, it is likely that tracheostomy will not cause obstruction in respiration (D).\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
