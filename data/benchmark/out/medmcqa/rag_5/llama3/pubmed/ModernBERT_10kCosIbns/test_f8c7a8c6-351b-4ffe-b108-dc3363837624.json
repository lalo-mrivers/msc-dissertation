["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the validity and reliability of a new method for measuring Haemoglobin levels. The provided data shows 10 successive readings of a single sample, which are slightly scattered around a mean value. However, the standard calorimetry result was 10.2, indicating that the new method has some variation. This suggests that there may be some error or inconsistency in the new method's measurement. Therefore, I would conclude that the validity is high, as it is consistent with other methods (standard calorimetry), but the reliability is low, due to the scattered readings.\", \"answer_choice\": C}"]
