["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents discuss the effects of norepinephrine on patients with septic shock. In one study, it was found that arterial or mixed venous plasma norepinephrine levels were higher in nonsurvivors than survivors. Another study showed that norepinephrine infusion can increase pulmonary shunt and mean pulmonary artery pressure.

None of these studies mention a decrease in heart rate, renal perfusion or urine output as a response to norepinephrine infusion.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
