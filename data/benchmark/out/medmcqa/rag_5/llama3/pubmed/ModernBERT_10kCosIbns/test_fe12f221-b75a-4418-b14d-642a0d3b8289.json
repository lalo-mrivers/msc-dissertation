["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, it is clear that the AS/BS occlusal angle, Wits appraisal, and ANB angle are used to determine sagittal jaw relationship. None of these measurements directly relate to the colum angle. Therefore, we need to look for another relevant measurement. The document 'A study of reference lines for mandibular plane angles' discusses various methods for measuring mandibular plane angles, including MP-sella nasion and MP-gnathion occiput. The colum angle is a part of the mandibular plane angle. Therefore, we can infer that increased colum angle is related to a specific class of malocclusion.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: Class III\""]
