["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the lingual extension of a Lower denture being limited by certain anatomical structures. Based on the provided documents, we can identify the anatomic structures that may limit the lingual extension of a Lower denture. Modiolus is not mentioned in any of the documents as a structure that would limit the lingual extension of a Lower denture. Mylohyoid muscle is also not mentioned as a limiting factor. The origin of genioglossus is an important landmark in the oral cavity, but it's not directly related to the lingual extension of a Lower denture. Sublingual salivary glands are present beneath the tongue and do not appear to be a structure that would limit the lingual extension of a Lower denture.\n\nThe relevant document that provides information on the anatomic structures that may limit the lingual extension of a Lower denture is [Ecologic changes in the oral cavity caused by removable partial dentures. 1]. According to this document, plaque formation and ecologic changes in the oral cavity can be influenced by the introduction of a removable partial denture. This does not provide direct information on the lingual extension of a Lower denture.\n\nAfter carefully reviewing all the provided documents, I conclude that none of the options mentioned (A-D) are directly related to limiting the lingual extension of a Lower denture.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
