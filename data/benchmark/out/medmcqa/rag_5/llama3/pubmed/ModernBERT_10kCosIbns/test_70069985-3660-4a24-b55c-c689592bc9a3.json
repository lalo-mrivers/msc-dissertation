["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the factors that affect the rate of dentinal fluid permeability. The provided documents discuss the hydrodynamic theory of dentin sensitivity, the effect of endodontic procedures on root dentin permeability, and the sensory mechanism in human dentin. Based on these documents, it can be inferred that temperature variation, pressure gradient across dentinal tubule, increase viscosity of dentinal fluid, and rate of removal of substances by blood vessels are all factors that could affect the rate of dentinal fluid permeability.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
