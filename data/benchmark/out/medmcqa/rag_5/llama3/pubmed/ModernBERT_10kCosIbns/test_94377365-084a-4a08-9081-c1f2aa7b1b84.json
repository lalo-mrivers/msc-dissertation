["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the sequence that a restriction endonuclease cuts at. From the provided documents, it seems that Class II restriction endonucleases recognize and cleave specific duplex DNA sequences. The document on [Distribution of DNA sequences recognized by specific endonucleases] mentions that EcoRI recognizes and cleaves a specific duplex DNA sequence. This is also mentioned in the review article 'Restriction endonucleases'. Since the question does not specify which enzyme, we can look at the possible choices. Comparing the given sequences to those recognized by Class II restriction endonucleases like EcoRI (GGCCCGC), it seems that AAGCTT is a recognized sequence.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D\n}"]
