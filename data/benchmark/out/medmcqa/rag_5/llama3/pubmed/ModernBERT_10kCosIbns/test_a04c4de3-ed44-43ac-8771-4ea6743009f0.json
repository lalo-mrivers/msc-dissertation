["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Since the initial substrate concentration is 1000 times the Km value of the enzyme, we can consider it as saturated. As a result, the reaction will be dependent on the enzyme concentration only. When the enzyme concentration is reduced to 1/3, the reaction rate will also decrease accordingly.\n\nThe amount of product formed initially (12 microgram/ml) corresponds to 170 substrate converted into product. Since the substrate concentration is doubled while the enzyme concentration remains the same, the reaction rate will increase twofold.\n\nWe can apply the Michaelis-Menten equation to solve this problem:\n\nv = Vmax [S]/(Km + [S])\n\nwhere v is the reaction rate, Vmax is the maximum velocity, S is the substrate concentration, and Km is the Michaelis constant.\n\nSince the initial amount of product formed (12 microgram/ml) corresponds to 170 substrate converted into product, we can set up an equation based on the amount of product formed:\n\nproduct = Vmax [S]/(Km + [S]) * time\n\nSubstituting the given values and solving for time, we get:\n\ntime = (product / (Vmax * [S])) * (Km + [S])\n\nUsing the given values, we can solve for time. First, let's find the Vmax value. Since the initial substrate concentration is 1000 times the Km value of the enzyme, we can consider it as saturated. Therefore:\n\nv = Vmax\n\nSubstituting this into the Michaelis-Menten equation, we get:\n\nVmax = v * (Km + [S]) / [S]\n\nNow, let's find the time taken to convert substrate into the same amount of product (12 microgram/ml), i.e., 170 substrate converted into product.\n\ntime = (product / (Vmax * [S])) * (Km + [S])\n\nSubstituting the given values and solving for time, we get:\n\ntime = (12 / ((Vmax * 2[S]) * [S])) * (Km + [S])\n\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
