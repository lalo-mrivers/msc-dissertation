["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks for the most appropriate method of testing the statistical significance of the differences between means of two groups. The relevant documents provide information on statistical tests and significance levels. The Quick test for comparing two populations with bivariate data mentions a procedure that reduces to Fisher's exact test for 2 X 2 tables, which is not applicable in this case since we are considering means of two groups. The Statistic tables to detect significance between frequencies in two small samples suggests using statistical tables derived from Fisher's exact factorial method, but these tables are designed for frequencies and may not be suitable for means. The articles on the power of a statistical test and the importance of significance provide insight into the concept of statistical significance and its connection to p-values. Therefore, based on the provided information, the most appropriate method would be...\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
