["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents suggest that near UV light affects cell proteins, which may inhibit DNA repair systems. The second document discusses the sensitization of ultraviolet radiation damage in bacteria and mammalian cells. It states that radiosensitizing drugs can sensitize cells to UV radiation. The third document mentions the transient species formed by photo-excitation of radiosensitizer molecules, which are capable of killing cells. Based on these findings, it is likely that the component that sensitizes bacteria and virus to UV irradiation is a type of radiosensitizer molecule.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: Nucleic acids\""]
