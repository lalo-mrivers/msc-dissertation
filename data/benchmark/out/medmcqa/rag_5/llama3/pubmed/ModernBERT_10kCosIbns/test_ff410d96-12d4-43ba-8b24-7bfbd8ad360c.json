["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks how enzymes help. The relevant documents describe enzymes as operating components of sophisticated regulatory systems, allowing flexibility for control by variation in ligand concentration. This suggests that enzymes are involved in regulating metabolic processes. The concept of constant proportion enzyme groups implies that enzymes play a role in maintaining biochemical homoeostasis. The adaptation strategies mentioned involve regulation of catalytic function through adjustments to the properties of different enzymes. Therefore, it can be inferred that enzymes help by.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
