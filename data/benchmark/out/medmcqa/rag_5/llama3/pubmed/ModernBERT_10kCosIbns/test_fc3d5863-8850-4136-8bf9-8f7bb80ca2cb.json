["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks which of the options is not true for rifabutin as compared to rifampicin. Rifabutin has been compared to rifampicin in several studies. One study found that rifabutin was less active than rifampicin against extracellular bacilli in pulmonary cavities, with a lower early bactericidal activity (EBA). Another study showed that the peak plasma concentrations of rifabutin after an initial dose were approximately 7 times lower than those after the same dose size of rifampicin. Rifabutin's relative bioavailability was also found to be slightly lower than that of rifampicin. Therefore, option D is not true as rifabutin has been shown to be less efficacious for pulmonary TB compared to rifampicin.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
