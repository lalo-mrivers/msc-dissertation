["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks which drug can be given safely in renal failure. To answer this, we need to consider the documents provided. The key point is that drugs usually eliminated by the kidneys require the most modification in patients with renal dysfunction. Since saxagliptin and sitagliptin are both DPP-4 inhibitors, they are eliminated primarily through kidney excretion.
