["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevance of radiographic resolution capacity is discussed in the provided documents. It is mentioned that resolution capacity is traditionally evaluated by radiography of metal objects (lead bar grids or fine slits). The document highlights the importance of signal/noise ratio and amplitude of signals in determining the resolution capacity. Therefore, it can be inferred that the resolution of IOPA radiograph depends on the signal/noise ratio.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
