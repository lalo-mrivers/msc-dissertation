["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The document about Alexander Fleming discusses the discovery of penicillin and its inhibition of staphylococcus growth. It also mentions that subsequent resistance by this organism to penicillin was marked by the production of penicillinase, an enzyme that inactivates penicillin and related antibiotics.
