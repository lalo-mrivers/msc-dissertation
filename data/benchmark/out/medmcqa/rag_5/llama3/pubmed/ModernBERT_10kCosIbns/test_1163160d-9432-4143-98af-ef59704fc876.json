["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents discuss periodontal disease in patients with Down's syndrome. According to 'Periodontal disease associated with Down's syndrome: an orthopantomographic evaluation', the study found that 84% of young adults (19-39 years old) with Down's syndrome showed advanced alveolar bone loss of 2.5 mm or more, compared to 27% in matched controls.

This suggests that the severity of periodontal disease is more pronounced in Down's syndrome patients, particularly in the lower molars.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
