["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about a cephalogram of a 10-year-old child. The values given are ANB = -4° and facial angle of 98°. We need to determine the case based on these values. According to the document 'Cephalic measures in normal pre-school children 3 to 7-years of age', the cephalic index (nCI) is useful in detecting changes in head shape mainly in cases of precocious cranioestenosis. Although this is not directly related to the given values, we can use it as a reference. The document 'Centile charts of cephalometric characteristics of Warsaw's children from 1 month to 7 years of age' provides centile charts and tables for various head dimensions including cephalic index (CI). Since the given values are not exactly matching with any specific criterion, we need to consider other possibilities.\n\nFrom the document 'A new cephalic index (nCI) was also determined (Diament, 1968)', it is mentioned that this index is useful in detecting changes in head shape mainly in cases of precocious cranioestenosis. Since ANB = -4° and facial angle of 98° are not indicating any significant difference in the shape of the head, we can rule out precocious cranioestenosis.\n\nThe document 'From piecemeal to configurational representation of faces' is not directly related to this question, but it provides information on face recognition and processing.\n\nThe document 'Infants' perception of similarity between live people and their photographs' also does not provide any relevant information for this case.\n\nBased on the given values ANB = -4° and facial angle of 98°, we can conclude that the cephalic index is likely to be normal. This is because a cephalic index of -4° is indicating a moderate degree of maxillary hypoplasia, but it is not extreme enough to cause significant changes in the shape of the head.\n\nAccordingly, the case is likely to be Maxillary hypoplasia (A).\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
