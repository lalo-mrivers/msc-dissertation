["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the documents, we know that blood flow is related to vessel diameter. The relationship for blood flow as a function of diameter is Q = 108d3.101 for arteries, arterioles and capillaries in the diameter range 5 to 900 mum. To find the rise of blood flow if the radius of blood vessels is increased by 50%, we need to increase the diameter by 1.5 times (since the radius is half the diameter). Then, we can calculate the new blood flow using the equation: Q = 108d3.101.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
