["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the increased risk of malformations due to lithium use during pregnancy. We have two relevant documents: one discussing cardiovascular malformations with lithium use during pregnancy and another prospectively studying pregnancy outcomes after lithium exposure during the first trimester. The latter study found no significant difference in major congenital malformations between the lithium group and controls, but there was 1 patient in the lithium group who chose to terminate pregnancy after Ebstein's anomaly was detected by a prenatal echocardiogram. This suggests that in-utero exposure to lithium during the first trimester might be associated with an increased risk of cardiac malformations, especially Ebstein's anomaly.\", \"answer_choice\": B}"]
