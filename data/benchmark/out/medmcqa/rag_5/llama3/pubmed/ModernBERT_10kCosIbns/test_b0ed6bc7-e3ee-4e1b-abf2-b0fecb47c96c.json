["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question states that no agglutination is seen after adding antiserum A and antiserum B and Rh +ve factor to a blood sample. This suggests that the blood sample's Rh status is not affecting the agglutination reaction, as both Rh+ve and Rh-ve factors are added. Therefore, the focus shifts to the ABO group system. Since no agglutination is seen, it implies that the blood sample does not have any A or B antigens present. Given that antiserum A and antiserum B were used, this suggests that the blood sample must be O-grouped.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
