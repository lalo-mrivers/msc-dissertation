["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the antiemetic action of metoclopramide. According to the documents, metoclopramide produces catalepsy by blocking striatal dopamine receptors. This suggests that metoclopramide has a D2 antagonist property. Additionally, the document 'Pharmacological evidence for cerebral dopamine receptor blockade by metoclopramide in rodents' states that metoclopramide antagonises apomorphine-induced stereotypy in rats and apomorphine reversal of reserpine-induced locomotor suppression in mice, which suggests a D2 antagonist property. Therefore, the antiemetic action is likely due to its D2 antagonist property.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
