["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the preference for chemically cured composite for core built up on a molar tooth. We can rule out options B and C as they are related to the appearance or brittleness of light cure resin, but not directly relevant to chemically cured composites. Option A is also unlikely as it only mentions light cure resin's strength, without considering its suitability for cores. Therefore, we focus on option D which highlights the benefits of lower viscosity in chemically cured composite for core construction.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
