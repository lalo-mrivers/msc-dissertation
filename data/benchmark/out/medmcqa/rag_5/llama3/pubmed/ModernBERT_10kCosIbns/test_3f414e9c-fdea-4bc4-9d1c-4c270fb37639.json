["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about digoxin toxicity. We need to find the true statements from the given options. The relevant documents are about post-mortem digoxin levels, monitoring digoxin therapy, acute digoxin poisonings, and interpreting digoxin concentrations. From these documents, we can conclude that: gastrointestinal symptoms may not be the earliest manifestation of digoxin toxicity (monitoring digoxin therapy), non-specific vision changes may be noted in digoxin toxicity (interpreting digoxin concentrations), and early toxicity may not correlate with serum levels (interpreting digoxin concentrations). Neurological symptoms may occur without corresponding cardiovascular changes is also supported by the document 'Monitoring digoxin therapy'. Therefore, the correct statements are B, C, and D.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
