["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for the best noninvasive investigation to check for the viability of myocardium. The relevant document 'Differing attenuation coefficients of normal and infarcted myocardium' mentions computerized transaxial tomographic scanner which can measure significant differences in attenuation coefficients between normal and infarcted myocardium, offering a new approach to evaluating and understanding the processes of tissue injury and death. This suggests that computed tomography (CT) scan or positron emission tomography (PET) scan could be used for viability assessment. Additionally, 'Evaluation of myocardial function' mentions indices of contractility which can reflect events occurring during isometric contraction prior to ejection, such as rate of change in intraventricular pressure, maximum velocity of muscle shortening, and velocity of shortening of contractile elements. This suggests that echocardiogram could also be used for viability assessment. However, 'Resistance and tolerance of myocardium in ischemia: experimental results' does not provide relevant information to answer the question.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
