["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about CPR techniques. Statement 1 mentions giving Czan (which is not a known medical term) irrespective of rib fracture. This statement seems unclear or incorrect. Statements 2 and 3 discuss the adult and infant CPR ratio, which can be found in the provided documents. Statement 4 discusses the chest compression rate for adults and infants.\n\nAfter reviewing the provided documents, I found that the document on 'External cardiac compression' mentions that mechanical chest compression may be employed when trained personnel are not readily available or where manual compression is technically difficult to perform. This suggests that CPR technique can vary depending on the situation.\n\nThe document on 'Respiratory responses to chest compression in human subjects' provides information on respiratory frequency, tidal volume, and minute ventilation during different magnitudes of chest compression. This does not provide direct answers to the question but offers insights into the effects of chest compression.\n\nThe document on 'Active compression-decompression resuscitation: a novel method of cardiopulmonary resuscitation' presents a new technique for CPR that incorporates both active compression and decompression of the chest. This study found that active compression-decompression CPR improved coronary perfusion pressure, systolic arterial pressure, cardiac output, and minute ventilation compared to standard CPR.\n\nThe document on 'Impairment of cerebral bloodflow by chest compression' provides a case report on the effects of prolonged chest compression on a patient's cerebral blood flow. This study does not offer direct answers to the question but provides insights into the potential complications of incorrect CPR technique.\n\nThe document on 'A new technique for external heart compression' presents an alternative method for external heart compression using the leg-heel method. This study found that this method can be effective, especially when performed by weak or fatigued rescuers.\n\nAfter reviewing all the documents, I found that Statement 2 is true (an adult chest compression : breath ratio of 30 : 2 to 15 : 2 even if a second rescuer is present), and Statement 4 is true (chest compression rates for adults are typically 100-120 per minute, while those for infants are usually around 90 per minute).\n\nStatement 3 seems unclear, as it discusses changing the infant CPR ratio when a second rescuer arrives. However, this information cannot be directly found in any of the provided documents.\n\nStatement 1 mentions giving Czan, which is not a known medical term and may indicate incorrect information. Therefore, Statement 1 is likely false.\",\n\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
