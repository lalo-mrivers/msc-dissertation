["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, P-glycoproteins are thought to act as ATP-dependent drug efflux pumps, actively extruding a range of structurally different, hydrophobic drugs from the cell. This suggests that P-glycoprotein inducers would be drugs that interact with this pump and increase its activity. Rifampicin is an enzyme-inducing antibiotic that has been shown to enhance P-glycoprotein expression in certain studies.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: Rifampicin\"\n}"]
