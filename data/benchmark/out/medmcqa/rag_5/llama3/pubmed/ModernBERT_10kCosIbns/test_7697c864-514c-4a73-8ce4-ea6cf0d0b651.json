["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the sequential arrangement of fetal scans. The relevant documents discuss various aspects of ultrasound imaging in pregnancy, including anatomic exploration, physiologic inference, and detection of abnormalities. Fetal growth and development are also mentioned as being assessed through ultrasound. Based on this information, it can be inferred that a comprehensive approach to fetal scanning involves a sequence of scans that provide information about the fetus's anatomy, physiology, and potential abnormalities. This suggests that all types of scans may be involved in such an approach.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
