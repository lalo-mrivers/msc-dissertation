["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents discuss various aspects of gingival autografts, gingivectomy, and vascular morphology. Since we are discussing embrasures, which are the spaces between teeth, we should focus on the information related to the anatomy and histology of the gingiva. The documents do not explicitly describe the size of embrasures as a function of position along the anterior-posterior axis. However, they do provide insights into the morphology of the gingival tissues and their vasculature. The study on vascular morphology in noninflamed healed gingiva of dogs describes the regular network of vessels found in marginal gingiva, which may be relevant to our question. Furthermore, the study on rebuilding of microvascularization following surgical gingival elimination by split flap provides information on the formation of new capillaries and the connection between superficial blood vessels and periosteal vasculature. Considering these points, we can infer that the size of embrasures might be influenced by the vascular patterns in the surrounding tissues.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C: Remain same\""]
