["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the synthesis of inosine from 5-amino-1-beta-D-ribofuranosyl-4-imidazolecarboxamide (AICA-riboside) and the use of iodine as a carbene source. Additionally, there are discussions about iodine-substituted nucleotides, amylose-iodine complexes, and reactivity of imino acids formed in amino acid oxidase reactions. Therefore, it can be inferred that iodine is primarily important in biochemical synthesis of nucleotides.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
