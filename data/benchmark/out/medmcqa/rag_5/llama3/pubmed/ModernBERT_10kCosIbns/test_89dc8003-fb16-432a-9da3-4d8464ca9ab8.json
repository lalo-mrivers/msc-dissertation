["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents are related to various aspects of surgery, including plastic surgery of splenic wounds with heterogenic preserved peritoneum, treatment of perforated peptic ulcer by primary gastric resection, evaluation of chromo-endoscopy for diagnosis of histological repair of gastric ulcer, and gastric resection after suturing of perforated ulcers. Perforated peptic ulcer is a topic that is mentioned in several documents. There is no mention of haemostatic agents specifically, so we need to look at the context and see if any of these options could be related to haemostasis. Freeze dried bone, Calcium Hydroxide, Ferric Sulphate, and Collagen are all substances that could potentially be used for haemostasis. However, freeze dried bone is not a typical haemostatic agent, so we can rule it out. The other options are more plausible, but we need to look at the context more closely to determine which one is most likely.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
