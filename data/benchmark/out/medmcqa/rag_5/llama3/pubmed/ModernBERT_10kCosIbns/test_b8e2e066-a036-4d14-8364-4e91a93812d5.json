["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the documents provided, uncontrolled diabetes mellitus is associated with hypertriglyceridemia (high triglyceride levels) and increased VLDL (very-low-density lipoprotein) levels. This suggests that the activity of enzymes involved in triglyceride metabolism may be altered. Lipoprotein lipase breaks down triglycerides into free fatty acids and glycerol, while hormone-sensitive lipase also breaks down triglycerides but is sensitive to hormones such as insulin. Given that uncontrolled diabetes mellitus is characterized by insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia (high insulin levels), it is possible that the activity of hormone-sensitive lipase may be decreased. This would lead to increased triglyceride and VLDL levels.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A: Increased activity of lipoprotein lipase and decreased activity of hormone sensitive lipase\""]
