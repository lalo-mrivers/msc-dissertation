["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about electrostatics and the B-to-Z transition of DNA. The documents provided explain the electrostatic free energy of DNA in a salt solution. We are asked to find the value of Z at resting membrane potential (RMP) when there is no net electrogenic transfer. Since this information is not present in the given documents, we need to analyze the provided texts to find any relevant information.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
