["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the instrument shown in fig. The provided documents describe various instruments such as acumeters, ultrasonic cleaning apparatus, and impact noise measurement techniques. Among these, the document '[History of instrumental measuring of hearing acuity: the first acumeter]' describes an instrument with a pendulum-like hammer that strikes against a plate swinging down from varying heights that could be read in degrees of angle from a scale. This instrument is likely the one shown in fig. The description of this instrument does not involve separation, so we can rule out choices A and B. Moreover, it is not used for rapid or slow separation, as it measures hearing acuity. Therefore, option C (Not used for separation) seems most plausible.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
