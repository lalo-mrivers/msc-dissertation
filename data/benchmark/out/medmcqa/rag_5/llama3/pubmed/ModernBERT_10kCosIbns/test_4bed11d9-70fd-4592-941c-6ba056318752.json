["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about modifying a property of alginate powder by adding Mgo. Based on the provided documents, we can find relevant information about alginate and its properties. The 'Alginate as immobilization matrix for cells' document describes alginate as an immobilization material for cells, but it doesn't mention anything about Mgo or its addition to alginate. The 'Comparative study of selected alginate materials and devices' document compares different brands of alginate impression materials, but again, there's no information about adding Mgo. The other documents seem unrelated to the question.\n\nThe closest relevant information can be found in the 'Alginate as immobilization matrix for cells' document, which discusses the structural and functional relationships in alginate gels. However, this information doesn't provide any specific insights into how Mgo addition affects alginate's properties. Therefore, we need to rely on general knowledge about alginate materials.\n\nAlginate is a natural polymer derived from seaweed, known for its viscoelastic properties and ability to form hydrogels when mixed with water. The addition of Mgo (magnesium oxide) can enhance the properties of alginate by forming a complex with the alginate molecules. This complexation can affect the rheological and mechanical properties of alginate, such as shear and tear strength.\n\nBased on this general knowledge, it's reasonable to assume that adding Mgo to alginate powder would increase its shear and tear strength (C). This is because the magnesium ions in Mgo can form a network with the alginate molecules, leading to improved mechanical properties.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"]
