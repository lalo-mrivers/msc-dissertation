["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about treatment resins for a specific type of edentulous ridges. Upon reviewing the provided documents, I noticed that none of the texts specifically mention edentulous ridges or their classification (abused, flabby, with large tori, or with bony resorption). However, we can infer some information from the text about cavity liners for composite resin restorations. It suggests that Dycal and Tubulitec may be suitable for dentin as they have a stronger adherence to it compared to other materials. This could imply that these materials might be useful for restoring ridges with bony resorption, which is characterized by the loss of bone tissue.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
