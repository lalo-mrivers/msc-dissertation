["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 7-year-old child with fever, tibial swelling, and X-ray shows periosteal reaction. Laboratory results show raised ESR and TLC. Given the location of the lesion (tibia) and the age of the patient, I consider the possibility of traumatic lesions of the upper tibial epiphysis in children or adolescents. The authors' recommendation is to perform surgical operation as soon as possible. However, before that, it would be important to exclude other possibilities such as infection.
