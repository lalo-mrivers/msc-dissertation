["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the position and movement of articular disc of TMJ. We need to identify the fibers that control it. From the provided documents, we can see that the articular disc of the hand has an extensive fibrous system that comes from the ulnar edge of the distal end of the radius and reaches the base of metacarpal V. Similarly, in the temporomandibular joint (TMJ), the articular disc is also controlled by fibers. In Part 1 of Biomechanical properties and collagen fiber orientation of TMJ discs in dogs, we see that the mediolateral fibers are composed of loose and less wavy bundles, and they are crossed perpendicularly by anteroposterior fibers in anterior and posterior bands. This suggests a stabilizing function.\n\nIn Part 2 of Biomechanical properties and collagen fiber orientation of TMJ discs in dogs, we see that the fibrous anulus in the periphery of the disc is composed of mediolateral fibers of anterior and posterior bands and anteroposterior fibers of medial and lateral portions of the middle band. This also suggests a stabilizing function.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that the position and movement of articular disc of TMJ are controlled by the mediolateral fibers.\", \"answer_choice\": B}"]
