["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the type of antibody involved in chronic allergy. We can look at the provided documents to find the answer. In 'Relationship between IgE and IgG antibodies in type I allergy', it is mentioned that immune stimulation in atopic individuals affects both IgE and IgG-producing antibody systems, indicating a correlation between the titers of anti-allergen antibodies of both isotypes. This suggests that IgE and IgG are involved in allergic reactions. In 'Allergens and atopic diseases', it is stated that allergen-specific IgE antibodies bind to mast-cells and basophils, leading to the production and/or release of various inflammatory mediators. The high production of allergen-specific IgE antibodies is a hallmark of atopic diseases. Therefore, we can conclude that IgE is involved in chronic allergy.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
