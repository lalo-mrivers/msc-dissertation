["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the indicators used at Anganwadi centers for growth monitoring in children. The relevant documents discuss biometric parameters of choice for a general medical assessment of growth and development, including attained height, weight for height, and weight. This information suggests that weight for age is not a common indicator used in general medical assessments. Therefore, the answer must be one of the other options. Mid-arm circumference is mentioned as an important measurement in one of the documents, but it is not explicitly stated as being used for growth monitoring.

The most likely correct answer is Height for Age.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
