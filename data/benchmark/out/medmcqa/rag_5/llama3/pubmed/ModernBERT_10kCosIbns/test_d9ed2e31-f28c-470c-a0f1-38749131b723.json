["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the features of a newborn's skull. The relevant documents provide information on the growth and development of the human skull during prenatal and postnatal periods. From these studies, we can infer that at birth, the diploe (the spongy layer of bone between the outer and inner tables) has not formed yet because it develops gradually after birth. The styloid process is also expected to be unfused with the rest of the temporal bone in a newborn as it fuses during childhood. The anterior fontanelle is open at birth, allowing for the passage of blood vessels and cerebrospinal fluid. Mastoid processes are not fully developed at birth and continue to grow throughout childhood. Based on these findings, options B and C seem plausible, while options A and D do not fit with our current understanding.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
