["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents discuss the molecular aspects of insulin action, its evolution, and the synthesis of biologically active insulin analogues. From these discussions, it is clear that certain modifications to the N-terminal amino acid residues of the A chain can affect the biological activity and immunoreactivity of insulin. Specifically, replacing asparagine at position 21 with isoasparagine resulted in a analogue with similar biological potency but lower immunoreactivity compared to the natural hormone.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
