["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Post-translational modification refers to the modification of a protein after its synthesis. The passage describes various post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, acetylation, and derivatization. Triiodothyronine is a thyroid hormone and not an amino acid, so it does not undergo post-translational modification. Hydroxyproline and hydroxylysine are both post-translationally modified forms of proline and lysine, respectively. Selenocysteine is another type of amino acid that can be incorporated into proteins during translation.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
