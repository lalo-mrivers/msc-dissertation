["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents do not provide information directly linking Class II division 1 malocclusion to specific oral motor habits such as hypertonic or hypotonic lower or upper lips. However, it is possible to infer the relationship by analyzing the cephalometric profile of patients with Class II, Division 2 malocclusions, which are described in The cephalometric distinction of class II, division 2 malocclusion document. This document shows that Class II, Division 2 malocclusions have a different skeletal and dental morphology compared to normal occlusions. Similarly, the mandibular mobility showed only minor changes from 12 to 15 years of age in A survey of craniomandibular disorders in 800 15-year-olds document. This suggests that oral motor habits may not be significantly affected by Class II division 1 malocclusion.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
