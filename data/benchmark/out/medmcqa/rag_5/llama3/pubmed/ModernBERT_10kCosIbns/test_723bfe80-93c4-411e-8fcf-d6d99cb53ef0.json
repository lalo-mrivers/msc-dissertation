["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to the relevant documents, especially 'Jawbone enlargement using immediate implant placement associated with a split-crest technique and guided tissue regeneration', we know that implants can be placed after splitting the alveolar ridge longitudinally in two parts. A chisel was used to make a fine cut and spread apart the two cortical plates. Implants were then placed, and expanded polytetrafluoroethylene membranes covered the implants and defects. This technique showed a gain in bone width, varying between 1 and 4 mm; maxillary sites showed greater ridge enlargement. Therefore, we can infer that the minimum width required for implant placement is at least 8 mm (4 mm per implant), considering the maximum gain in bone width.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
