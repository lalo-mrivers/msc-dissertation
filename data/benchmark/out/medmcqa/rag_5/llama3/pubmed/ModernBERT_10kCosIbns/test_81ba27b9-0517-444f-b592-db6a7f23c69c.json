["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Acetazolamide is a non-competitive inhibitor of carbonic anhydrase enzyme. This means that it binds to the enzyme at a site other than the active site, and prevents the enzyme from catalyzing the reaction. As a result, the maximum velocity (Vmax) of the reaction is decreased. The Km (Michaelis constant) is not directly affected by non-competitive inhibition.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A: Decrease in Vmax\""]
