["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, we can see that chronic mercury toxicity is a result of exposure to low-level concentrations over an extended period. The Agency for Toxic Substance and Disease Registry states that 'mercury toxicity can be a difficult diagnosis to establish because it produces subtle effects at chronic low-level exposures.' Additionally, the Clinical toxicology of mercury document highlights the importance of early detection and prevention of overexposures, indicating that prolonged exposure can lead to chronic toxicity. Finally, Total mercury levels in selected human tissues, Idaho-1973-74(1,2) suggests that mercury residues can accumulate in human tissues, potentially leading to chronic toxicity. Given this information, it is likely that chronic mercury toxicity results from a combination of factors, including exposure through various routes.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D\n}"]
