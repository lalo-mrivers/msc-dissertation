["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the mandibular molar, which is a type of tooth. After reviewing the documents, I found that none of them specifically discuss the characteristics or classification of teeth. However, I can use my knowledge as a medical expert to informally answer this question. Mandibular molars are typically classified into two main categories: Tritubercular and Quadritubercular. Tritubercular molars have three roots, while Quadritubercular molars have four roots. Since the documents do not provide any information about teeth classification, I will rely on my general knowledge to informally answer this question.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: Triconodont\""]
