["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the lead with maximum voltage of R wave for an ECG with 'mean' axis of 90deg. The mean axis refers to the direction of the QRS complex in relation to the standard leads I, II and III. For a 90 degree mean axis, the R wave would be maximized in lead II as it is the most lateral lead.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
