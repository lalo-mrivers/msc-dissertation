["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks which zone is characterized by macrophages and osteoclasts. We can analyze the given documents to find the answer. In the first document, it is mentioned that macrophages disrupt calcified tissue extracellularly and appear to engulf large fragments of mineralized matrix.
