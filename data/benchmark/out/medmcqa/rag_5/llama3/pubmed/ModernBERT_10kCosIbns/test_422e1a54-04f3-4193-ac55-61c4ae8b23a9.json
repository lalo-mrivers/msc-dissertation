["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant document for this question is '[Heme biosynthesis]. 300--400 mg of heme is synthesized daily in the organism. Heme is the prosthetic groups of hemoglobulin, cytochromes and other hemoproteins. Major sites of heme synthesis are bone marrow and liver. At least 7 enzymes and intermediary products are involved in the sequence of reactions that lead from glycine and succinyl coenzyme A to heme.' This document indicates that succinyl-CoA is one of the intermediate products involved in the sequence of reactions leading to heme synthesis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
