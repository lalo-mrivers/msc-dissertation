["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the condition that usually results in a liver biopsy showing features of 'Giant Cell/Neonatal hepatitis'. From the given documents, we can infer that Giant Cell/Neonatal hepatitis is associated with poor prognosis and liver failure. In the document 'Fate of infants with neonatal hepatitis: pediatric surgeons' dilemma', it is mentioned that 7 out of 10 patients who died had periportal fibrosis, inflammation in the periportal area, and diffuse giant cell transformation on histological examination.
