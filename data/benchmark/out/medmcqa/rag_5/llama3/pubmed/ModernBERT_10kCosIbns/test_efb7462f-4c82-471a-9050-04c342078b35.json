["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant document is [Letter: Velocity of passive conductance in a branching fiber]. This letter discusses the conduction velocity of electrotonic potentials in fibers with infinitely long branches. Another relevant document is 'A supernormal period in central axons following single cell stimulation.' This study obtained intracellular recordings from caudate nucleus efferent neurons in cats and found that the impulse activity of a single fiber can modulate excitability and conduction velocity independent of surround impulse activity. The third relevant document is 'Supernormal period in central axons following single cell stimulation.' This study also discusses the modulation of excitability and conduction velocity by single-fiber impulse activity. These documents do not mention any of the options A, B, C, or D.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
