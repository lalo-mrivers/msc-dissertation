["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking which pressure defines the vascular system in the absence of blood flow. We can see from the documents that when there is no blood flow, the pressure drops significantly. According to the document 'Influence of pressure and flow on constriction of blood vessels', the forces of pressure and shear force play a role in controlling vascular resistance. In the absence of blood flow, these forces would not be present or would be minimal. The document 'Transmural pressures and tissue perfusion in man' mentions that at high tissue pressures there may be a sharp decline in blood flow. This suggests that in the absence of blood flow, the pressure would be relatively low. Therefore, I think the answer is likely related to the concept of critical closing pressure.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
