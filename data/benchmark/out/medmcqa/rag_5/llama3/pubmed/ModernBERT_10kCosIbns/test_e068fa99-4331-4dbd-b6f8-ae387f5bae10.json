["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"After reviewing the documents, it is clear that tetanus is a significant problem in developing countries, with high mortality rates. The need for an improved treatment is emphasized. A retrospective study of 98 patients with tetanus treatment over three years suggests that a specialized centre and well-organized program are necessary. The Dakar International Conference on Tetanus concluded that tetanus can be eliminated by proper use of tetanus toxoid, highlighting the importance of prophylaxis and immunization. A review of the literature also emphasizes the need for continued stress on prophylaxis to eradicate the disease.
