["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the role of barrier membrane in GTR (Gap Junction Regulation). The provided documents discuss various topics such as ion transport, potential energy curves, surface charge distributions, and channel models. However, none of these documents explicitly mention 'GTR' or 'barrier membrane'. Therefore, I will analyze each document to see if any information can be applied to this question.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
