["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant study for this question is the first one, which compares cephalic proportions between a group of male Caucasian trisomic Mongoloids (people with Down's syndrome) and a control group of male Caucasians. The ratios studied include midfacial area/endocranial area, mandibular area/endocranial area, and midfacial area/mandibular area. The study found that the Mongoloid group had significantly smaller ratios in all three areas. Specifically, it was mentioned that there was a significant degree of deficiency in midfacial area, mandibular area, and endocranial area in the Mongoloid group. This suggests that people with Down's syndrome have a general deficiency in facial structure. However, one ratio, midfacial area to mandibular area, remained nearly constant with age and was comparable to that of the normal group.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
