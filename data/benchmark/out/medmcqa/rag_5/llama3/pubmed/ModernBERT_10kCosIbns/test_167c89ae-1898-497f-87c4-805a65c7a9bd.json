["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the occlusion of supporting cusps. From the 'Application of \\\"cusp writer\\\" findings to practical and theoretical occlusal problems' document, we know that cusp angulations are determined by various occlusal determinants such as incisal guidance, condylar guidance, plane of occlusion, curve of Spee, and plane of motion. The optimal height and angulation of the cusps depend on the reciprocal relationships between these determinants. Therefore, the supporting cusps occlude in the **Embrassures**, which is a region where the cusp angulations are determined by the plane of occlusion and curve of Spee.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
