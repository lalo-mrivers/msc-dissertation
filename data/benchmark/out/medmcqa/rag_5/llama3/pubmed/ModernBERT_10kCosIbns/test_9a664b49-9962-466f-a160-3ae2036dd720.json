["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The provided documents seem to be related to craniofacial growth and development. A study of craniofacial skeleton and the concept of pattern in craniofacial growth do not mention remodelling theory explicitly. Vertebrate craniofacial development: the relation between ontogenetic process and morphological outcome does not provide any information about remodelling theory either. Anatomical macroelements in the study of craniofacial rat growth is a separate study that uses mathematical methods to analyze growth, but it does not mention remodelling theory. A note on craniofacial sutural growth discusses local growth phenomena and fibre orientation in sutures, which may be related to remodelling, but the term 'remodelling theory' is not mentioned. The most relevant document seems to be 'The concept of pattern in craniofacial growth', which discusses the complex interaction between brain case and facial skeleton during growth, but it does not mention a specific person or study that provided the remodelling theory. \",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
