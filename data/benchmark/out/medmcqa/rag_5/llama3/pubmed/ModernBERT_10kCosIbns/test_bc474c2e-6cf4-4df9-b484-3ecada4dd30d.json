["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The muscle spindle is a sensory organ that detects changes in muscle length. According to the provided documents, muscle spindles are found in various muscles, including the anterior tibial and toe extensor muscles (Recruitment order of human spindle endings...). The document 'Movement-dependent after-effects...' states that spindle reactions evoked by changes in muscle length or external load were studied on de-efferented muscles. This suggests that muscle spindles are receptors for detecting changes in muscle length, which can be caused by stretching or shortening of the muscle.\n\nFrom the document 'Morphogenesis of rat muscle spindles...', we know that muscle spindle morphogenesis is influenced by innervation and that the differentiation of intrafusal fibers is dictated by their specific pattern of innervation. This also suggests that muscle spindles are receptors for detecting changes in muscle length, as they respond to stretch or shortening.\n\nThe document 'A muscle spindle model...' describes a simulation of intrafusal mechanical events, which further supports the idea that muscle spindles detect changes in muscle length. The model includes linear elastic elements representing sensory parts and muscle fibers representing muscular parts, all of which generate depolarization on increasing stretch.\n\nTherefore, based on the provided documents, it can be concluded that muscle spindle is a receptor for detecting changes in muscle length.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
