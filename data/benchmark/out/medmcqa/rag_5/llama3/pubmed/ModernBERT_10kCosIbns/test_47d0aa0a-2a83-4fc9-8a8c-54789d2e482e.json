["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the provided documents, we can see that MRSA is a significant problem in hospitals. The documents highlight the importance of proper treatment and prevention to combat MRSA infections. We also know from [Considerations on MRSA infections in relation to modern chemotherapy] that many antibiotics have lost their effectiveness against MRSA due to resistance. Additionally, [Multiple resistance to drugs by MRSA] states that most MRSA isolates are multiply resistant to various antimicrobial agents.\n\nLooking at the potential choices for the drug not useful for MRSA, we can see that Cefaclor is a third-generation cephalosporin which may not be effective against MRSA. Cotrimoxazole has been shown to be effective against some MRSA strains, as mentioned in [Epidemic outbreak of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in a general hospital. Preliminary report]. Ciprofloxacin is also ineffective against many MRSA strains, as seen in the same document.\n\nVancomycin has been shown to be effective against some MRSA strains, particularly those resistant to other antibiotics. Therefore, based on the information provided, Vancomycin would not be considered useless for MRSA treatment.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
