["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant document that addresses condensation shrinkage of porcelain during firing is 'Hot-pressed porcelain process for porcelain-fused-to-metal restorations.' The passage states that the technique records shrinkage of 0.001 to 0.005 inch at the supporting cusp tips and fossae. This suggests that the shrinkage depends on the temperature and pressure applied during firing, rather than factors such as rate of arriving at firing temperature, uniformity of particle size, shape and size of particle, or type of investment used.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
