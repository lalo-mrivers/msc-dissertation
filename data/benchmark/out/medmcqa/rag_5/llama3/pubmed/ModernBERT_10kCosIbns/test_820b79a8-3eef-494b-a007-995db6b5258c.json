["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking which type of nerve fibre is least susceptible to LA blockade. From the provided documents, we can infer that myelinated fibers are less susceptible to LA blockade compared to unmyelinated fibers. The document 'Subblocking concentrations of local anesthetics: effects on impulse generation and conduction in single myelinated sciatic nerve axons in frog' suggests that the interfiber variation in susceptibility to LA block could result from differences in the density of sodium and potassium channels, which is more pronounced in unmyelinated fibers. Additionally, the document 'Morphologic basis of conduction block' highlights that myelination can contribute to the resistance of a nerve fiber to blockade. Therefore, it is likely that A alpha or B fibers, being myelinated, are less susceptible to LA blockade compared to C fibers.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
