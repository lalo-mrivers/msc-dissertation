["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"This question is about the shape of access cavity in mandibular 1st molar with 4 canals. There are no relevant documents provided that describe the anatomy of mandibular 1st molar's root canal configuration or access cavity shape for teeth with 4 canals. However, we do have information on the root canal morphology of mandibular premolars and molars. Since the question is about a specific type of tooth (mandibular 1st molar) and there are no specific documents provided that describe this tooth's anatomy, we cannot rely solely on the given documents for our answer. We must consider the possible shapes of access cavity based on general knowledge of dental anatomy.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
