["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the pathology of pancreatic endocrine tumors, a clinicopathologic study of 24 cases, and immunohistochemical remarks. The studies highlight the multiple hormone synthesis of endocrine neoplasms of the pancreas. In particular, the study on pancreatic tumors in multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 indicates that patients with hyperinsulinism tend to have a favorable long-term outcome after surgery. This suggests that insulinomas are one type of functional tumor of the pancreas. Additionally, the study notes that many lesions are positive for immunostaining with multiple hormones, including pancreatic polypeptide, insulin, glucagon, and somatostatin.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
