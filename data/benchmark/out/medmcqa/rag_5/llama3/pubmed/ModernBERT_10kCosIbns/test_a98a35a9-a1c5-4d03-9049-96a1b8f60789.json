["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe odontoblasts, which are cells that form dentin, a tissue found in teeth. The first document discusses the development of bone tissue-like organization in primary osteoblast cultures and mentions the transition from uniform distribution of cuboidal osteoblasts to multilayered nodules with smaller cells. There is no mention of cell size in this context. The second document discusses odontoblast metabolism in rats deficient in vitamin D and calcium, but does not provide information about cell size either. The third document measures calcium ion activity and pH in the odontoblast-predentin region and provides data on intracellular pH, but it does not relate to cell size. The fourth document characterizes the cytoskeleton in human normal and otosclerotic osteoblast-like cells, which is also unrelated to cell size. Based on these documents, there is no direct evidence that can be used to determine the odontoblastic layer's cell size.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
