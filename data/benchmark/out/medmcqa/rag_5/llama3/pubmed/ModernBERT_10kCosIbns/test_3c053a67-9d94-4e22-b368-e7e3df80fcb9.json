["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks when direct pulp capping is not done. The options provided are mechanical exposure, no bleeding, pinpoint exposure, and carious exposure with more than 1 mm in size. Based on the given documents, direct pulp capping is a technique used to cover the pulp of a tooth. Mechanical exposure, no bleeding, and pinpoint exposure do not necessarily indicate when direct pulp capping should be avoided. Carious exposure with more than 1 mm in size could be an indication for indirect pulp capping rather than direct pulp capping. Therefore, option D: Carious exposure with more than 1 mm in size is the correct answer.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
