["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question describes a male infant born at term who develops respiratory distress shortly after birth. The chest radiograph shows a diffuse ground glass appearance to the lung fields, which suggests surfactant deficiency or dysfunction. Surfactant replacement fails to improve gas exchange, suggesting that the issue is not just surfactant deficiency. Over the first week of life, hypoxemia worsens, indicating a progressive disease. The absence of routing culture and echocardiographic findings indicates that infection or cardiac anomalies are unlikely. Considering the presence of respiratory distress in the term female sibling who died at 1 month of age, it is likely that this infant has an inherited disorder affecting surfactant function.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
