["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the effect of 2,3-BPG on haemoglobin oxygen affinity. The relevant documents describe the binding of 2,3-BPG to haemoglobin and its effects on oxygen affinity. Hb Rancho Mirage has a substitution at position 143 in the beta chain that contributes to the anionic 2,3-DPG binding site in Hb. This variant exhibited normal oxygen affinity at physiologic pH and reduced affinity at alkaline pH. The properties of Hb Rancho Mirage suggest that there appear to be no major perturbation of the critical C-terminal residues. Species differences in the binding of compounds designed to fit a site of known structure in adult human haemoglobin show that the size of the shifts of the dissociation curves are in the sequence expected from the postulated numbers of interactions made by each compound with each haemoglobin type, based on the assumption of a common receptor site for the three compounds. Multiple linear regression analysis shows that the free energies of interaction of the compounds with the haemoglobins may be predicted, to a first approximation, by summing the number of ionic and covalent bonds predicted for each effector-receptor combination.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
