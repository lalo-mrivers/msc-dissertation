["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The passage describes the immediate physiological response of odontoblasts to pathological processes or iatrogenic trauma. The study investigated changes in primary and replacement odontoblast activity after cavity preparation or pulpal exposure. It is mentioned that 125I-fibrinogen was demonstrated within the dentinal tubules and in the floor of the cavity preparation as early as 5 minutes after completion of the cavity preparation. This suggests that operative trauma can effect very rapid changes to the dental pulp, leading to leakage of plasma proteins from the circulation.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
