["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant document for this question is [Measuring the turbidity of amniotic fluid, a possibility to assess fetal maturity before birth (author's transl)]. The turbidity of amniotic fluid was measured in 125 cases. No correlation was found between turbidity and length of gestation from day 261 to day 287 after last menstruation. However, there is strong and significant contingency between turbidity of amniotic fluid and maturity of fetal skin (quantity of vernix caseosa) or clinical maturity assessed according to Farr et al. Based on this information, we can infer that the color of normal amniotic fluid during delivery would not be affected by gestational age.\", \"answer_choice\": C}"]
