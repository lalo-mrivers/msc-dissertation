["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking which of the given options has an intracellular receptor. To answer this, we need to refer to the relevant documents provided. The structure-activity relationships for transmembrane signaling mention that receptors can be classified into three superfamilies: 1) ligand-regulated oligomeric ion channels, 2) ligand-regulated tyrosine kinases, and 3) G protein-linked rhodopsin-related receptors. This suggests that some receptors have intracellular components. Furthermore, the classification of cell receptors mentions that some receptors are sevenfold membrane-spanning receptors with known conformation and dynamics of biological function. This also implies that some receptors may have intracellular domains.\n\nThe immunological approaches for probing receptor structure and function mention that certain receptors can be used as templates for analyzing topographical models of membrane proteins with immunological probes, especially anti-peptide antibodies. This suggests that some receptors may have specific regions or domains within the cell that can interact with these probes.\n\nConsidering these points, we can deduce that receptors involved in signal transduction and internalization processes are more likely to have intracellular components. Endocytosis and signals for internalization discuss common structural features and chemistry of internalization sequences, which further supports the idea that some receptors may have intracellular domains.\n\nBased on this step-by-step thinking process, we can conclude that...\", \n\"answer_choice\": \"D: Thyroxine\""]
