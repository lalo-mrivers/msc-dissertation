["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the most accurate and safe method to diagnose a bleeding pregnancy at 6 weeks. The relevant documents mention different diagnostic methods such as real-time ultrasound, Doppler ultrasound, pregnancy kits, and urinary Beta-hCG determination. Since the patient has a bleeding pregnancy, it's likely that the pregnancy is already confirmed, and we're looking for a way to confirm the gestational age.

Urinary Beta-hCG determination may not provide enough information about the gestational age.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
