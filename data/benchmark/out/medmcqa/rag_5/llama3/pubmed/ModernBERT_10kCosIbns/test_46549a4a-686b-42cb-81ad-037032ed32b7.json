["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the properties of high Cu alloys. We can look at the documents provided to find the information. Document 1 talks about the strength of amalgam alloys, and it mentions that single melt high copper type alloys generally possess the greatest strength. This suggests that high Cu alloys have high tensile strength (Option A). Document 2 does not mention anything specific about creep or corrosion. Document 3 discusses the addition of alloying elements to improve oxidation resistance, but it does not mention high Cu alloys specifically. Document 4 reviews modern methods for preparing metallic alloys and their potential applications, but it does not provide information on the properties of high Cu alloys. Finally, Document 5 talks about the relationship between mechanical properties and casting porosities in an Au-Pd-Ag-Cu alloy, but it is not directly related to high Cu alloys. Therefore, we can conclude that high Cu alloys have high tensile strength (Option A), low creep (B) and high corrosion resistance (C). However, the question asks for exceptions, so we need to find out what they do not have. According to Document 1, single melt high copper type alloys generally possess the greatest strength, which means that high Cu alloys tend to achieve maximum tensile strength more rapidly than maximum compressive strength. This does not suggest low creep or high corrosion resistance.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: None of the above\"\n}"]
