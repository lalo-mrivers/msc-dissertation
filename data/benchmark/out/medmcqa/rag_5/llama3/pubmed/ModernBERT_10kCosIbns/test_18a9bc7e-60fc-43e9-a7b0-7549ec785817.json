["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The provided documents describe the digastric muscle's functions related to electromyography, anatomical variations, and its interaction with the sympathetic nervous system. One of the main findings is a linear relationship between force and integrated electrical activity during isometric contraction. Additionally, there are descriptions of bilateral anatomical anomalies and anti-fatigue actions exerted by the sympathetic nervous system. Considering these points, it becomes clear that the digastric muscle is primarily involved in the depression of the mandible.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
