["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the properties of gold-nickel binary alloys. It is mentioned that Au-Ni alloys have mechanical properties equal to those of hardened Au added Pt alloy or type IV Au alloy. Additionally, it is stated that Ni-59-65Cr26-23Mo11-9 alloys released distinctly lower quantities of nickel in lactic acid/saline solutions at pH 2.3, 4.2, or 6.5 than other tested alloys. This suggests that nickel has a beneficial effect on the properties of gold-nickel alloys and is not detrimental to their corrosion resistance. Therefore, it can be concluded that nickel is added to wrought gold alloys as a.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
