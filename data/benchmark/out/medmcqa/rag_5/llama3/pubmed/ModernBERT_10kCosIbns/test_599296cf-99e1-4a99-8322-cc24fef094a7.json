["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is Rh-negative and had a negative Indirect Coombs Test (ICT). She received Anti-D during 28 weeks of pregnancy. This suggests that the patient has not yet developed significant antibodies to Rh-positive antigens. The question does not mention any specific concerns about the baby's blood group or health, so we can focus on providing prophylactic measures for the mother.
