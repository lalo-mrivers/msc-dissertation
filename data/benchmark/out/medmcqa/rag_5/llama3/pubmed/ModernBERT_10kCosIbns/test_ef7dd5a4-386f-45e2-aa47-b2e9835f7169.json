["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about autogenic inhibition. The relevant documents discuss different types of inhibition, including modification of cell proliferation with inhibitors, detection of nootropic activity indicated by acute inhibition of orientation reaction, combination rules for inhibitory stimuli, and stimulus controllability and the latent inhibition effect. However, none of these documents specifically mention autogenic inhibition or its relationship to any specific anatomical structure. Therefore, we need to look at the possible choices provided.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: Golgi tendon organ\"\n}"]
