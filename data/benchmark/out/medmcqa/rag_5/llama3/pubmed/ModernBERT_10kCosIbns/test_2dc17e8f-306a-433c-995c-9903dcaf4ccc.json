["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, we can see that cartilage is mentioned as a precursor to bone in some regions. In 'The remodeling of the edentulous mandible', it is stated that the basal bone on both medial and lateral sides of the corpus is depository in nature, suggesting that this region ossifies from cartilage. Additionally, in 'Three-dimensional finite element stress analysis of the dentate human mandible', it is mentioned that the biomechanical events which accompany functional loading of the human mandible are not fully understood, but it does provide comparative data for the second model, which had an increased vertical corpus depth. This suggests that the corpus has some degree of flexibility and may be able to ossify from cartilage. Therefore, we can conclude that the part of the mandible which ossifies in cartilage is likely related to the corpus.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: All of the above\"\n}"]
