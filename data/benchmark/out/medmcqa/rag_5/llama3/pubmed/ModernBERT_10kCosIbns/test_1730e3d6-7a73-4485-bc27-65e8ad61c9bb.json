["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the advantages of intensifying screens in reducing radiation dose to patients. Specifically, they mention that rare-earth intensifying screens can decrease X-ray exposure for patients by a factor of 2 to 2.5 (Experimental study of intensifying screens used in diagnostic radiography). This reduction in radiation dose is due to the increased efficiency of the screen-film combination. In the context of extraoral radiographs, this means that using an intensifying screen can decrease radiation exposure to the patient.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
