["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about chronic hyperplastic pulpitis. Pulpal vascular changes in inflammation suggest that there is no information about hyperplastic pulpitis. However, [Pulpitis chronica clausa, diagnosis and therapy] mentions chronical pulpitis. According to this study, it does not specify the type of chronical pulpitis but suggests that regressive metamorphoses and pulpal biomorphose are examined by histological findings. It implies that there might be information about chronical hyperplastic pulpitis in literature reviews. The [Induction of autoallergic pulpitis in rabbit (author's transl)] study discusses experimental auto-allergic pulpitis, which is different from chronic hyperplastic pulpitis. Therefore, the answer cannot be found in these studies. No relevant information was found about chronic hyperplastic pulpitis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
