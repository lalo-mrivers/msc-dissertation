["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The depth of clinical gingival sulcus is defined as the distance between the gingival margin to... We need to find the correct anatomical landmark. The gingival sulcus is formed by the space between the sulcular epithelium, the junctional epithelium, and the wall of the tooth. The relevant document [Physiology of the gingivo-dental sulcus] explains that the sulcus is normally sterile and will tend to eliminate any foreign particle. Leucocytes and desquamated epithelial cells will also tend to leave the gingival sulcus and will be found in saliva. Based on this information, we can exclude options A (Cementoenamel Junction), B (Alveolar crest) and D (Apical penetration of the probe). The correct answer is C (Apical extension of junctional epithelium) because it is the point where the sulcus meets the tooth.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
