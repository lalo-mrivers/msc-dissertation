["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the surface structure of dentin after routine treatments, the sensory mechanism in human dentin, oxalate desensitising treatment of dentinal surface, variability of clinical dentin substrates, and morphology of the mineralizing front. These documents do not provide direct information about sealer penetration into dentinal tubules. However, they provide insights into the morphology of dentin surfaces, including the presence of dentinal tubules and their potential obstruction. Based on these findings, it can be inferred that sealer penetration into dentinal tubules may depend on the condition of the dentin surface, which could affect the ability of the sealer to penetrate and adhere to the dentin.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B: Method of obturation\"\n}"]
