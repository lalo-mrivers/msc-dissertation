["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The physiological active form of cholesterol is discussed in the document 'Modulation of membrane function by cholesterol'. The mechanism of modulation is due to two main reasons: first, cholesterol antagonizes the requirement of 'free volume' by integral membrane proteins for conformational changes as part of their functional cycle; secondly, it modulates membrane protein function through direct sterol-protein interactions. This suggests that the active form of cholesterol is likely to be either free or in a specific interaction with membrane proteins.\", \"answer_choice\": C}"]
