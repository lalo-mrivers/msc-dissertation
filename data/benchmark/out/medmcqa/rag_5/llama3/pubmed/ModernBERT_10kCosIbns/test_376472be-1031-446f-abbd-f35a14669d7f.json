["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is an 8-year-old child who had a maxillary central incisor fracture 10 months ago. The pulp shows no response, but there is no periapical lesion on the radiograph. This indicates that the pulp has likely necrosed and the root canal treatment is necessary. The primary concern is to preserve the remaining healthy pulp and prevent further complications. Considering the child's age and the time elapsed since the fracture, a conservative approach would be more suitable.\n\nThe available options for treatment are: A) Ca(OH)2 pulp capping, B) Formocresol pulpotomy, C) Conventional root canal treatment, D) Complete debridement and apexification. Since the pulp is non-vital, neither pulp capping nor pulpotomy would be effective.\n\nOption C) Conventional root canal treatment might not be suitable for a child of this age, as it may require multiple appointments and could be traumatic for the young patient.\n\nOption D) Complete debridement and apexification seems to be the most conservative and effective approach in this scenario. It aims to clean and shape the root canal system, remove any debris or infected tissue, and then fill the canal with a suitable material to prevent further complications.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
