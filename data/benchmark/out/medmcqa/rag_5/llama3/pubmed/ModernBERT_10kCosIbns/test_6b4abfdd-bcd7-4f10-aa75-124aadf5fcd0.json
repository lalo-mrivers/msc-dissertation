["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine how many divisions in the 2 ml syringe will be filled to give 180 mg ceftriaxone, we need to first calculate the total number of milliliters needed. Since each mL contains 500 mg of ceftriaxone, we can divide the required amount (180 mg) by the concentration per mL (500 mg/mL). This gives us 0.36 mL. The syringe has 2 mL, and we need to fill it up to 0.36 mL. Since there are 10 divisions per mL on the syringe, each division represents 0.1 mL. To get the required amount of 0.36 mL, we need to add 3.6 divisions (0.1 mL x 3.6 = 0.36 mL).\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
