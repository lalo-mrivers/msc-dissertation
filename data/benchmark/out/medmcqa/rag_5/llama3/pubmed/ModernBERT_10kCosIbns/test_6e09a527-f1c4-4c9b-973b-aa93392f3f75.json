["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the mechanism of adverse events, which is increased binding to secondary targets. The key point is that these secondary targets are proteins. According to the documents, particularly Protein toxin inhibitors of protein synthesis, one class of toxins kill eukaryotic cells by covalently modifying unique structural features of components essential for protein synthesis. This means that the primary target is a component involved in protein synthesis. Therefore, the secondary target should have similar binding sites.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
