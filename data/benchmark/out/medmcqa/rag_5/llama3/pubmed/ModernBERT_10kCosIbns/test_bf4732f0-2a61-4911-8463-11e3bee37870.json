["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The primary anti-caries activity of fluoride (F) is via topical action. According to the study 'Fluoride concentrations in plaque, whole saliva, and ductal saliva after application of home-use topical fluorides', the retention of F in the mouth after topical fluoride treatment is considered to be an important factor in the clinical efficacy of F. The paper emphasizes that the method of F delivery, the F concentration of the agent, and the time of application (daytime vs. night-time) are important factors influencing F levels in the mouth. This suggests that the primary action of topical fluoride is related to its retention in the mouth.\",\n\"answer_choice\": A"]
