["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the direction of axonal transport. The relevant documents describe fast axoplasmic transport as a crest of labelled activity moving down nerve fibres (anterograde) followed by a plateau representing later egress of labelled components from cell bodies and materials left behind the advancing crest. Additionally, it mentions that later additions of labelled materials compartmented in the cell bodies also contribute to the later pattern of outflow. Furthermore, the documents describe slow axonal flow as transporting cytoskeletal proteins along axons, which is likely a form of anterograde transport. No evidence suggests retrograde transport.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
