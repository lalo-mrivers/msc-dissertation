["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the location of the visual cortex. We can look at the provided documents for information on the rat visual cortex and mouse visual cortex. The rat visual cortex has a field striata (field 17) with a medial (field 18) and lateral (field 18a) lying peristriatic area, which suggests that it is located in the occipital lobe. Similarly, the mouse visual cortex also has a topography similar to that found in other mammals, including the human, where the upper visual field projects posteriorly, suggesting again that it is located in the occipital lobe.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
