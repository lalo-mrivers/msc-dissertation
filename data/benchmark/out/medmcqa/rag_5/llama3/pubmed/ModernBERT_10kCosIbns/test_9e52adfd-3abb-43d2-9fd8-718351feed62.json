["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about maximum penetration among different types of radiation. The given documents are not directly related to the topic, but one can deduce that the document [Comments on the paper by D. Tausch et al.] might be relevant as it discusses penetration power of various bullets into skin and muscle tissue. Since we are looking for a type of radiation, we need to focus on the types mentioned in the context of radiation or energy transfer. Alpha, Beta, Gamma, and Electron Beam are all types of ionizing radiation. Among these, Gamma rays have the highest penetrating power.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C\n}"]
