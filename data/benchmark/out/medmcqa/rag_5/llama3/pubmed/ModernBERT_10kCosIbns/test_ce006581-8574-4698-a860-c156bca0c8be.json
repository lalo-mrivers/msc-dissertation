["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant document is 'The estimation of disease frequency using a population sample.' This paper discusses the estimation of disease frequency using a population sample. It states that 'the statistical theory allows the estimation of incidence or prevalence credibility intervals both for the collection of all cases and where resources are such that only a representative sample of all cases is used.' The sample size in this case is 100, which is a representative sample of all cases. Therefore, we can estimate the confidence interval using the formula: CI = p ± (1.96 * sqrt((p*(1-p))/n)), where p is the estimated prevalence (10%), and n is the sample size (100). Plugging in the values, we get: CI = 0.10 ± (1.96 * sqrt((0.10*(1-0.10))/100)) = 0.10 ± 0.032.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
