["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The darkening of radiograph X-ray depends on the interaction between the object's thickness, quality and quantity of X-rays emitted from the cathode. The angulation cone is used to control the direction of X-ray beam, but it does not directly affect the darkening of the radiograph. Velocity of electron emitted from cathode is also not relevant to the darkening process.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
