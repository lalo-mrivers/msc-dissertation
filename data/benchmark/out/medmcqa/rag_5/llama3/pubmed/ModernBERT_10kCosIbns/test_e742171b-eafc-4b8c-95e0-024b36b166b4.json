["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about a situation where there is bone resorption but no tooth resorption. According to Wein, this means that we need to subtract some value from the radiographic length. The relevant document for this question is [Notes on osteoclastic resorption]. In this document, it is mentioned that after methylene blue staining, no osteoclasts have been observed but only small mononucleated cells (fig. 3 and 4). This suggests that there may be some confusion between bone resorption and tooth resorption. However, based on the provided documents, I found that [A case of progressive external root resorption] is the most relevant document for this question. This case report describes a radiographical, histological and histochemical study of an extracted mandibular tooth with progressive external root resorption. The cells which appeared to be responsible for the hard tissue resorption showed an intense acid phosphatase activity, similar to that of bone-resorbing cells.\",\n\"answer_choice\": A"]
