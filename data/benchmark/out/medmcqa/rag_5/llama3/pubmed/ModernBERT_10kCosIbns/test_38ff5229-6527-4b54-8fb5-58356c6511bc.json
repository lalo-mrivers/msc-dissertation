["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about adrenocorticosteroids in excess, which refers to Cushing's syndrome. The first document describes patients with elevated plasma cortisol concentrations and a normal response to exogenous ACTH, but the axis was not suppressed by oral dexamethasone. This suggests Cushing's syndrome. The third document discusses the effects of ACTH on adrenal polyphosphoinositides, which may play a role in hormonal modulation of membrane-associated metabolic events. However, it does not directly relate to the question about adrenocorticosteroids in excess. The second and fourth documents discuss the regulation of mineralocorticoid hormones and the effect of ACTH on aldosterone and cortisol biosynthesis. While these topics are relevant to the adrenal axis, they do not directly address the question about adrenocorticosteroids in excess. Therefore, based on the provided information, Cushing's syndrome is the most likely explanation for adrenocorticosteroids in excess.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D: None of the above\"}"]
