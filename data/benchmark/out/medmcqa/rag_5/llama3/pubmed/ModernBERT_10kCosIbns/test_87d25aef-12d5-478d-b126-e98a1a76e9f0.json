["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks which stage of Plasmodium vivax is infective to mosquito. From the provided documents, we can infer that oocysts are the stage that develops into heavily infected salivary glands in Anopheles maculatus mosquitoes (Development of different strains of Plasmodium vivax in two species of Anopheles). This suggests that oocysts are the infective stage to mosquitoes. Furthermore, studies on human malaria in Aotus monkey. VII. Comparative infectivity of two strains of Plasmodium vivax to Anopheles freeborni, A. maculatus, and for strains of A. albimanus imply that a strain of Plasmodium vivax from El Salvador was more infectious to the Apastepeque strain of Anopheles albimanus from El Salvador than was a strain of P. vivax from Colombia, S. A. This further supports the idea that oocysts are the infective stage to mosquitoes.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
