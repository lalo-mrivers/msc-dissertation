["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, we need to calculate the total number of live births. Since 456 births occurred, but 56 showed no signs of life at birth, we subtract 56 from 456 to get 400. Then, we subtract 56 deaths before 28 days and 34 deaths between 28-1 year from the total live births to get the number of surviving children: 400 - (56 + 34) = 300. Finally, we divide the total number of deaths by the number of surviving children to get the infant mortality rate.\",\n\"answer_choice\": A"]
