["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for features of non-paralytic polio. A quick glance at the provided documents reveals that they are mostly related to poliomyelitis or poliovirus, which may not directly answer the question. However, a closer look at the symptoms and characteristics mentioned in the documents can help us identify relevant information. For instance, [Poliomyelitis in the German Federal Republic 1974-1975] mentions 'typical for poliomyelitis' disease symptoms in some cases, which might imply that non-paralytic polio would not have those specific symptoms. Similarly, [Epidemiologic study of risk factors in polio--case-control study on 117 pairs.] discusses the major risk factors for polio, but does not explicitly mention features of non-paralytic polio. [Seroepidemiology of poliomyelitis in Mexico] is an epidemiological study that doesn't provide direct information about symptoms or characteristics of non-paralytic polio either. Finally, [Genetic susceptibility to wild and vaccine polio virus: genotypes and their frequency.] talks about genetic predisposition and frequency of certain genotypes, but does not address the question directly.\",\n\"answer_choice\": A"]
