["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to the provided documents, it is mentioned that reactivation of a silent Ac following tissue culture is associated with heritable alterations in its methylation pattern. Additionally, enzymatic DNA methylation may be hardly realized through the modification of gene regulatory elements. This suggests that methylation can affect gene expression without changing the content of the gene. Similarly, X inactivation and differentiation are proposed to be initiated and maintained by sequence-specific DNA methylases that methylate half-methylated sites.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
