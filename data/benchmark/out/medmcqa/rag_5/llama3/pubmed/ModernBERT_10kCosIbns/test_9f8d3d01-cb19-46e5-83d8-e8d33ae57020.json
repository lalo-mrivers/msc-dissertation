["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about making an impression for a patient treated with radiation therapy. The treatment information suggests that the patient has a squamous cell carcinoma involving 2/3rd of tongue. This indicates that the tumor is quite extensive and may have caused tissue damage or scarring. Given this, it's likely that traditional impression materials like polysulfide or polyether might not be ideal due to their potential to amplify any existing tissue defects.
