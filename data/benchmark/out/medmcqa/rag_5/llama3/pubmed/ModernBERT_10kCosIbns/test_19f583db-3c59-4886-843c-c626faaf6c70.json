["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking to test the statistical significance of the difference in height between a group of 20 boys aged 10 years and a group of 20 girls of the same age. The variances are given as ±13 cm for boys and ±7 cm for girls, which indicates that we have unequal variances. Therefore, we cannot use the t-test (C) because it assumes equal variances. We also can't use X2 (A) because it's used for categorical data, not continuous data like height. The F-test (D) is used to compare two or more variances, but that's not what we're trying to do here. Therefore, the only test left is Z (B), which is a one-sample test that can be used to compare means between groups with unequal variances.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
