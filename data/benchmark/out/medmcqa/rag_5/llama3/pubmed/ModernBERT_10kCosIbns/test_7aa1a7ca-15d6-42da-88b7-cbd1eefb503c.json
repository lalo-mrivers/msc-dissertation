["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks for the cause of death in congenital diaphragmatic hernia. We have three relevant documents that describe the pathology, clinical presentation, and management of congenital diaphragmatic hernia. In the first document, it is mentioned that the mortality rate has increased in recent years, with an overall mortality rate of 26.7%. The poor prognostic factors include low PH value of initial blood gas, early onset of symptoms at birth, and total absence of hemidiaphragm. This suggests that death can be caused by a combination of these factors. In the second document, it is mentioned that low PH value of initial blood gas was one of the poor prognostic factors. This implies that acidosis may be a cause of death in some cases. The third document discusses long-term outcome and does not mention mortality directly. However, it does suggest that pulmonary hypoplasia can lead to respiratory complications that need to be treated to preserve respiratory function in adulthood. Therefore, the answer is likely to be related to the lungs. Based on this information, we can conclude that the cause of death in congenital diaphragmatic hernia is primarily due to respiratory failure.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
