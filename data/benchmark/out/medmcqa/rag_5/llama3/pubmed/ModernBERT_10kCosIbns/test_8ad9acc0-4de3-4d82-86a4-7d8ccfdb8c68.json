["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the provided documents, we can infer that periapical bone resorption occurs due to the activity of osteoclasts. In the [New views on morphology and function of osteoclasts] document, it is mentioned that uninuclear metabolically very active cells of bone are responsible for normally caused bone absorption. These cells conglomerate and form a second line that always links with rising bone absorption.\n\nIn the Three-dimensional studies on resorption spaces and developing osteons document, we can see that osteoclasts tunnel preferentially into highly mineralized bone, and usually do not use previously existing canals as templates for their advance.\n\nFrom these findings, we can conclude that periapical bone resorption is caused by the activity of osteoclasts.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
