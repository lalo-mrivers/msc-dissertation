["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the given documents, we can see that the Partogram (also referred to as 'Partogramme' or 'partograph') is a graphical guide to progress in labor. It represents various stages of labor with respect to time and cervical dilatation. The Partogram provides alerts and actions lines for early detection of abnormal labor patterns.
