The technique for modification of dentures during the implant healing phase highlights the risk of loading fixtures during occlusal movements if the tissue surface is relieved. This suggests that careful consideration should be given to the design of clasps and their interaction with the surrounding teeth. Furthermore, the article on A device for fixation of partial removable dentures in cases of single-standing teeth emphasizes the importance of enhancing design rigidity and denture fixation safety through the use of telescopic crowns.\n\nConsidering these points, it appears that poor clasp design can indeed lead to failure of partial dentures. Therefore, to avoid this failure, careful consideration should be given to the design of clasps and their interaction with the surrounding teeth.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
