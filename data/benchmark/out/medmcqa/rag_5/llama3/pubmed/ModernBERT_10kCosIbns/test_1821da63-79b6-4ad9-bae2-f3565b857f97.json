["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe two types of hemorrhagic shock models. The first model is characterized by fixed hypotension, where blood pressure remains low throughout the experiment. The second model is normotensive, where blood pressure returns to normal after an initial decrease. Both models have a mortality rate of 80%. In both groups, heart rate increases to more than 200 beats/min. However, in hypotensive shock, it decreases in the late stage of hypovolemia. Cardiac output is higher in normotensive animals throughout the hypovolemic phase.\n\nThe documents also describe the changes in cerebral blood flow and distribution during hemorrhagic shock. In both groups, total cerebral blood flow decreased slightly immediately after hemorrhage. However, in the late hypotensive stage, there was a decrease in flow calculated as a percentage of cardiac output and absolute flow compared to the initial response to hemorrhage.\n\nFurthermore, the documents discuss the changes in arterial plasma osmolality and glucose concentration during graded hemorrhagic hypotension. The results show that bleeding evokes significant increases in plasma osmolality at all three hypotension levels and the responses are quantitatively related to the degree of hypotension.\n\nBased on these findings, it can be inferred that hypotension occurs when blood loss is more than 30% - 40%. This is because both models have a mortality rate of 80%, which suggests that a significant amount of blood loss is required to induce hypotension. Additionally, the changes in cardiac output and cerebral blood flow suggest that the body's compensatory mechanisms are overwhelmed at this level of blood loss.\n\nTherefore, it can be concluded that hypotension occurs when blood loss is more than 30% - 40%. This conclusion is supported by the findings from both models.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
