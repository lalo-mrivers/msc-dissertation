["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks which anticonvulsant causes contraction of the visual field. The relevant documents are about visually evoked responses (VERs) in albino rats, visual-vestibular interactions, eye-head movement coordination, and contrast sensitivity of individual color mechanisms of human vision. None of these documents mention the specific anticonvulsants listed as options (Levetiracetam, Phenytoin, Vigabatrin, Ethosuximide). Therefore, we cannot determine which anticonvulsant causes contraction of the visual field based on the provided information.\", \"answer_choice\": \"None of the above\""]
