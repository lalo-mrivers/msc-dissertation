["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, we can analyze the information regarding thrombolysis in acute ischemic stroke. The overview analysis shows a 20% increase in the odds of death and a 30% reduction in the odds of death or deterioration after thrombolytic treatment for acute ischemic stroke. Exclusion of the two trials conducted without the benefit of computed tomographic scanning shows a 37% reduction in the odds of death and a significant reduction of 56% in the odds of death or deterioration after thrombolytic treatment. There does not appear to be an excess risk of hemorrhagic transformation of the cerebral infarct or of severe edema formation. The experimental cerebral ischemia data have pointed to the need to treat acute clinical stroke within only a few hours or less to effectively reduce stroke morbidity and mortality. Therefore, thrombolysis is considered a treatment option for patients with acute ischemic stroke.,\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
