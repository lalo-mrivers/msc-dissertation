["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking when to start treatment for an adult patient with panfacial trauma. The relevant documents suggest that the cranial problem is often explored during the first 3 or 4 days after trauma, and maxillofacial treatment can be undertaken early. Additionally, one of the documents suggests that the best time for operation is around the 10th day following trauma. However, another document emphasizes the importance of immediate attention to patency of the airway and to circulation in patients with facial injuries. Given these conflicting information, it seems that the question is asking about the timing of treatment for the craniofacial injury itself, rather than the overall care of the patient. Therefore, I would focus on the documents discussing the management of craniofacial trauma.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
