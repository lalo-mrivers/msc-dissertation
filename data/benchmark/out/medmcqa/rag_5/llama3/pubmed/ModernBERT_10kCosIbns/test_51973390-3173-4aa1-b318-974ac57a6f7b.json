["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about suitable techniques for diagnosing posterior interproximal caries in children. After reviewing the provided documents, we can see that they mainly discuss various methods for detecting and monitoring dental caries, including radiographic scoring codes, intra-oral roentgenograms, and bitewing radiographs. Specifically, one of the documents mentions a study on the progression of proximal caries in primary teeth using posterior bitewing radiographs. This suggests that bitewing radiographs are suitable for diagnosing posterior interproximal caries in children. Furthermore, another document discusses the use of bitewing radiographs with Bisecting angle and Paralleling techniques, but does not mention RVG or Panoramic Radiography as methods for detecting posterior interproximal caries.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
