["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the provided documents, it can be inferred that fibrinolytic therapy involves the activation of plasminogen to form plasmin, which then breaks down fibrin and dissolves thrombi. The documents also mention that all four currently available fibrinolytic agents are capable of initiating thrombus dissolution and cause degradation of fibrinogen and predispose to bleeding complications.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe document 'Experimental defibrination and bothropase: a study on the fibrinolytic mechanism in vivo' mentions that plasmin activity was blocked completely by aprotinin (Trasylol) but not by EACA. This suggests that EACA may be an antidote for fibrinolytic therapy.\\r\\n\\r\\nTherefore, based on these findings, it is concluded that Epsilon aminocaproic acid (EACA) is the antidote for fibrinolytic therapy.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
