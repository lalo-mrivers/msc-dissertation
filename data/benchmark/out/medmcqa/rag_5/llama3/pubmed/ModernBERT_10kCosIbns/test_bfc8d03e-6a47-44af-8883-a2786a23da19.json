["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the most common side effect of oral ampicillin administration. We can rule out A because there is no mention of anaphylactic shock or any severe allergic reaction in the provided documents. Among the remaining options, we see that the pharmacokinetics study mentioned that the esters (bacampicillin and pivampicillin) had a higher bioavailability than ampicillin itself, which suggests that oral administration might not be as well-absorbed as expected. We also see that high doses of oral ampicillin led to incomplete absorption. This information does not indicate any of the more severe side effects mentioned in options A-D.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
