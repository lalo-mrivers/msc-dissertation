["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the most accurate method of determining working length in a tooth with an open apex. From the given documents, we can see that there are different methods used to determine tooth length or working length, such as radiographic measuring method, sliding caliper, and electrical devices. However, the provided options only include moisture on paperpoint, electronic apex locator, other digital method, and a combination of both 1 and 2. Among these options, only the electronic apex locator is directly related to determining working length in a tooth with an open apex.
