["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, we can conclude that estimating dental age from radiographs is a common method used to determine an individual's age. The most reliable tooth for this estimation is the second molar (Position 7), which is mentioned in the first document. Since no specific information about the tooth examined is given, we will consider the general methods used for dental age estimation. According to the third document, a method combining multiple regression analysis of data from Gustafson's and Maples's scoring system, direct morphological measurements obtained with a Kontron image analysis system, and logarithmic data transformation was found to provide smaller standard errors of estimate compared to previous studies. As this method seems to be more precise, we will use it as our basis for estimation.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
