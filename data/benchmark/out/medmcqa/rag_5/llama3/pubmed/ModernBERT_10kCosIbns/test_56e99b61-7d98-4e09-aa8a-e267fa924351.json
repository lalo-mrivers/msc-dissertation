["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the location of receptors for olfactory sensation. According to the provided documents, we can see that there are descriptions of the structure of the olfactory region and the presence of cilia-like processes in the olfactory cells. We also know that the olfactory epithelium has a pseudostratified columnar organization and consists of olfactory neurons, supporting and basal cells. Near the mucosal surface, there are microvillar cells which have neuron-like features and may be chemoreceptors. Based on this information, we can conclude that the receptors for olfactory sensation are present in\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
