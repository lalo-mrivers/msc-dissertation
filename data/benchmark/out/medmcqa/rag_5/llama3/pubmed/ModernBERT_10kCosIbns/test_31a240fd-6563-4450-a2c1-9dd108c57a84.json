["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks which of the following is not used in polymerase chain reaction. From the given documents, we know that Taq polymerase is a main enzyme used in the PCR method. DNA Polymerase is also mentioned as one of the enzymes that can be used for high-fidelity PCR. Dideoxyribonucleotides are not explicitly mentioned but are related to sequencing techniques which involve PCR. DNA template is essential for PCR as it provides the target sequence to be amplified. Based on this information, we can conclude that none of the options are actually 'not used' in PCR.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
