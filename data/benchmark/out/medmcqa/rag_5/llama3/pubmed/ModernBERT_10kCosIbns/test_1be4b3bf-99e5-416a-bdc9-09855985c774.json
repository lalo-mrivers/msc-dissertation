["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents provide information on human growth and development during prenatal life. The 'Patterns of Retarded Fetal Growth' document discusses the measurement of weight, length, and head circumference at birth to document the size and shape of infants born at term. It proposes different patterns of intrauterine growth to explain variation in infant appearance at birth. The document also mentions that most small-for-gestational-age infants were proportionately stunted, suggesting prolonged intrauterine growth retardation.\n\nThe 'Birth Weight, Length, Head and Chest Circumference and Haemoglobin Level of Newborn' document reports on the birth weight, length, head circumference, and haemoglobin level of 1002 full-term newborn babies. It compares these results with similar data from other countries.\n\nFrom this information, it is not explicitly stated that a specific part of the body is underdeveloped at birth. However, we can infer that since most small-for-gestational-age infants were proportionately stunted, there might be some underdevelopment in size or growth.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
