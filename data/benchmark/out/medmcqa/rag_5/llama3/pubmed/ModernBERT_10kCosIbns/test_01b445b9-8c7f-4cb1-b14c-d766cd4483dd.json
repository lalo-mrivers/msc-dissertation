["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, it seems that none of the texts directly mention a tooth numbering system. However, one of the documents mentions arranging artificial teeth according to anatomic landmarks. This suggests that a specific system might be used for this purpose.
