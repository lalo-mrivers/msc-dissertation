["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about coarse tremors of the tongue. From the given documents, we can infer that resting tremor is characteristic of Parkinson's disease and responds to treatment with L-dopa. Action tremor is maximal when hands are outstretched and intention tremor occurs during movement. Orthostatic tremor associated with voice tremor was reported in a patient diagnosed as 'forme fruste' of essential tremor. The document doesn't mention anything about coarse tremors of the tongue being associated with Parkinson's disease, which suggests that it might not be related to Parkinsonism. Coarse tremors of the tongue can be caused by various conditions including thyrotoxicosis and neurosyphilitic disorders such as general paresis. Therefore, we can conclude that coarse tremors of the tongue are seen in all except Parkinsonism.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
