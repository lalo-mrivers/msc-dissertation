["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about which cement is irritating to the pulp. We have several documents related to different cements and their effects on the pulp. The first document talks about reactions of pulp to resin cements, which scored lowest reactions compared to controls. Silicate cement, a positive control, scored highest inflammatory reaction in intermediate period but resolved after 60 days. The document also mentions that traditional reactions to calcium hydroxide were observed when used with calcium hydroxide. The second document discusses thermal coefficients of paste-paste type pulp capping cements, which were all almost the same or lower than that of dentin. There is no mention of any cement causing irritation in this document. The third document talks about bacteria and pulpal reactions under silicate cement restorations, where only in 11 teeth with bacterial growth and inflammatory reaction in the pulp were observed. Silicate cement per se does not seriously irritate the pulp. The last document discusses marginal adaptation of adhesive inlays after removal of unpolymerized composite cement, which is unrelated to pulp irritation.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
