["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, we need to find a relevant statement that mentions 'Store in a cool place'. The document 'Room temperature stability of drug products labeled for refrigerated storage' explains that many pharmaceutical products labeled for storage under refrigeration are stable at room temperature for extended periods. This suggests that 'Store in a cool place' might refer to room temperature (around 20-25°C). However, we also have another option in the document 'Medications not to be refrigerated', which states that some drug product labelers mentioned that their products should not be refrigerated. One of these labels says 'Store in a cool place'. Considering this, we can infer that 'cool place' might refer to temperatures between 2-8°C, which is the temperature range typically used for storing medicines.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C\n}"]
