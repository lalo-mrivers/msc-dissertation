["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant document is [Enamel bundles and lamellae under the scanning electron microscope]. Lamellae are described as appearing in two kinds: 1. Organic material originating in the dentino-enamel membrane filled the whole space. 2. The space was empty, yet an organic membrane was covering the walls of adjacent prisms.
