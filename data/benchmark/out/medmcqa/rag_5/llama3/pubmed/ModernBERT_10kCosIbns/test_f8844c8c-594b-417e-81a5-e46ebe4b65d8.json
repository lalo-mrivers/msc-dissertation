["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents provide information on prenatal serum screening for Down's syndrome. However, the question specifically asks about first-trimester screening. Based on the provided documents, there is no mention of specific tests used in the first trimester. The discussions are focused on second- and third-trimester screenings using maternal serum markers such as AFP, free estriol, beta HCG, and others. Therefore, it can be inferred that the question is likely referring to non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) which typically uses blood biomarkers such as PAPP-A and beta HCG in combination with other tests like ultrasound measurements.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A: Beta HCG and PAPP-A\"\n}"]
