["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the highest concentration of oxygen delivered. From the provided documents, we can infer that the devices which employ the Venturi principle at settings of 40% or less deliver accurately determined oxygen concentrations. The non-Venturi devices show highly variable concentrations received due to the volunteers' peak inspiratory flow rates exceeding total gas flows delivered by the devices. Therefore, among the given options, the highest concentration of oxygen is likely to be delivered through a Venturi mask.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
