["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To calculate the Nernst potential for a negative ion, we need to use the Nernst equation: E = RT/F * ln([X]_out / [X]_in). Where R is the gas constant (8.314 J/mol*K), T is the temperature in Kelvin (298 K for body temperature), F is the Faraday constant (96,485 C/mol), and [X]_out and [X]_in are the concentrations of the ion outside and inside the cell, respectively.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the concentrations from mMoL to moL: 100 mMoL = 0.1 moL, and 10 mMoL = 0.01 moL.\n\nThen, we can plug in the values into the Nernst equation:\n\nE = (8.314 J/mol*K) * (298 K) / (96,485 C/mol) * ln((0.1 moL) / (0.01 moL)) = -61 mV\n\nSince the ion is negative, we need to flip the sign of the result: E = +61 mV.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D: +61 mV.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
