["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, it is clear that NK cells play a crucial role in the immune response against viral infections. The first document suggests that NK cells are activated to high levels of cytotoxicity 3 d after infection with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) or murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV). Additionally, it is mentioned that the activation, proliferation, and antiviral properties of natural killer (NK) cells were examined in severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice to determine the influence of mature T or B cells on virus-induced NK cell functions. The document also mentions that depletion of the NK cells in vivo with antiserum to asialo GM1 rendered both SCID and CB17 control mice much more sensitive to MCMV infection, indicating that NK cells play a crucial role in controlling viral replication.\n\nThe second document suggests that human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) can infect NK cells, which may contribute to the loss of NK cell function observed in AIDS patients. However, it is also mentioned that reduced NK cell function involves another mechanism, suggesting that the loss of NK cells is not solely due to HIV infection.\n\nThe third document suggests that NK cells may play a significant role in both rejection of tumor cells and resistance to viruses, particularly persistent infections. It is also mentioned that an analysis of the in vitro cytotoxic activity of spleen cells from normal nude mice indicated that P.I. cell lines, but not uninfected cell lines, were susceptible to spontaneous cytotoxicity, which suggests that NK cells may be involved in the rejection of virus-infected tumor cells.\n\nThe fourth document suggests that individual NK cell clones lyse both tumor cell targets and herpes simplex virus-infected fibroblasts in the absence of interferon, indicating that NK cells can recognize and kill infected cells without the need for interferons.\n\nThe fifth document provides an overview of the role of NK cells in resistance to cancer and infection. It suggests that NK cells are important in early defense against microbes and use different tactics to arm the host against the offending agent. With each type of microbe, NK cells use a different tactic to kill or inhibit the growth of infected cells.\n\nBased on this information, it appears that NK cells are effective against viral infected cells only if the cell with infection...\", \"answer_choice\": B"]
