["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks for the disadvantages of composite restoration except one. From the given documents, it is clear that composite restorations have some shortcomings. According to [Should I be using amalgam or composite restorations?], composites have a tendency to become more yellow with time and their resistance to marginal percolation is inferior to that of amalgam. Additionally, their ability to resist abrasion is unsatisfactory due to the failure of the bond between the filler particles and the resin.

Therefore, it is likely that this option refers to one of the advantages or neutral points of composite restorations.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
