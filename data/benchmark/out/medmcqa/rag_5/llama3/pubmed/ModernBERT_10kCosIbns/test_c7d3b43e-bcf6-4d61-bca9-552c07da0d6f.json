["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the given documents, we can see that hypoglycemia is more common in certain groups of newborns. For instance, preterm babies (12.8%) and small-for-dates infants (7 times increased risk) have a higher incidence of hypoglycemia compared to term babies. Large-for-dates infants also have an increased risk of manifesting hypoglycemia (10 times). Birth asphyxia is another identified risk factor for neonatal hypoglycemia, accounting for 24.2% cases. Respiratory distress and septicemia are also mentioned as risk factors. Maternal diabetes is not specifically discussed in the context of increased risk of hypoglycemia. Post-term infant is not a risk factor for hypoglycemia mentioned in the documents.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
