["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents suggest that pre-eclampsia is often associated with proteinuria. In the first document, it is mentioned that 19 patients had proteinuria exceeding 5.0 Gm per 24 hours and an additional eight patients had excretion ranging between 3.5 and 5 Gm per day. Additionally, in the fourth document, it is stated that 'the defect in glomerular permeability that leads to proteinuria can be assessed by determining the relative clearance of macromolecules of known but different dimensions, that is, glomerular selectivity.' This suggests that severe preeclampsia may be characterized by a high level of proteinuria. Therefore, it is likely that the level of proteinuria to diagnose severe preeclampsia is above 5 Gm per 24 hours.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: 3000 mg\"\n}"]
