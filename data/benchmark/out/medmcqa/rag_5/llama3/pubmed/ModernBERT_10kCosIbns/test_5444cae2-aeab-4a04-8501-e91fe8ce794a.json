["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the use of proparacaine for topical anaesthesia in ultrasound pachometry prior to refractive surgery. The study on short-term effects of proparacaine on human corneal thickness suggests that 0.5% proparacaine can alter corneal epithelial adhesion and increase corneal thickness, but the duration of this effect is not explicitly stated. Therefore, we cannot infer the time it takes for the action of proparacaine to start based on these documents.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
