["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the maximum torque during implant placement. Upon reviewing the provided documents, none of them specifically mention the maximum torque during implant placement. However, we can analyze the information about implants and their loading. For example, in the 'Implant superstructures: a comparison of ultimate failure force' document, it is mentioned that an 18-mm cantilever test prosthesis was constructed for each system and loaded on an MTS machine until failure occurred (n = 5 for each sample). This suggests that there are different forces acting on implants, including bending moments. Therefore, we should consider the maximum torque capacity of long bones as studied in 'Influence of a rigid plate for internal fixation on the maximum torque capacity of long bones'. The document states that the plates that had been applied for 7 months without previous osteotomy were removed, and a significantly reduced maximum torque capacity was observed. This suggests that the maximum torque during implant placement should not be above a certain value to prevent damage or failure.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
