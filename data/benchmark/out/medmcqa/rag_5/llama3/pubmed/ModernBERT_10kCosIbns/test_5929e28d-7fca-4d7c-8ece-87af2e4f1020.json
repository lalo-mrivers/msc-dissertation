["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about tooth structure cutting preceded by crack propagation due to tensile forces. From the provided documents, we can see that dental restorations, such as composites, porcelain-fused-to-metal crowns, and natural teeth, exhibit different rates of crack propagation under cyclic loading. Crack propagation in composites leads to high calculated rates compared to those of natural teeth or porcelain. This might explain observed clinical failures and microchipping at the area of occlusal contact, as noted in SEM analysis. The main difference between these materials is their wear rate. Natural teeth disperse occlusal stresses throughout the dentin, reducing the effect of high occlusal stress. Porcelain tends to wear the opposing dentition, which also reduces areas of high occlusal stress. Composite, however, demonstrates higher crack propagation rates than those of either natural teeth or porcelain due to its low wear rate. Therefore, it can be concluded that tooth structure cutting is preceded by crack propagation due to tensile forces.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
