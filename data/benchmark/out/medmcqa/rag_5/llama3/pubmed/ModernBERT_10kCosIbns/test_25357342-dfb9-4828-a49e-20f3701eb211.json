["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents discuss cleft palate, submucous cleft palate, and velopharyngeal function. It is mentioned that patients with submucous cleft palate often have a history of recurrent middle ear disease, and 16 out of the 47 patients had a history of such. Additionally, it is noted that the results for velopharyngeal function were better in patients operated upon under the age of 7 years.
