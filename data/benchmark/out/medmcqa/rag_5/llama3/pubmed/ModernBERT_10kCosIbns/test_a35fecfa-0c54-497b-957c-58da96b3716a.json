["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the ratio of chest compression to mouth breathing during CPR. None of the provided documents directly address this topic. However, we can analyze the effects of abdominal compression on minute ventilation and respiratory responses to chest compression in human subjects. The first document shows that manual compression of the upper lateral abdomen decreases minute ventilation in patients with chronic obstructive lung disease and bronchial asthma. The second document suggests that respiratory compensation for chest compression is different in conscious and anesthetized states, but does not provide information on the ratio of chest compression to mouth breathing. The third and fourth documents discuss the effects of continuous negative external chest pressure and occlusion pressure, respectively, but do not directly address the topic of CPR or the desired ratio.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"None of the above\""]
