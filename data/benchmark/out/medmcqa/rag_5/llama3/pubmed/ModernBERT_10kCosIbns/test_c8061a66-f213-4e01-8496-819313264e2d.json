["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the potential consequences of excessive monomer incorporation into an acrylic resin mixture. Based on the provided documents, particularly the 'Novel acrylic resins for dental applications' and 'Polymerization of pour type resin (author's transl)', we can infer that excess monomer can lead to increased polymerization shrinkage. This is because a higher amount of monomer would result in a greater amount of unreacted monomers being trapped within the polymer matrix, leading to increased shrinkage during curing.\", \"answer_choice\": C}"]
