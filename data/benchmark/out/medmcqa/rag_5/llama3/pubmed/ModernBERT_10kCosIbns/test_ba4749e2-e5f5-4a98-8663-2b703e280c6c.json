["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, handwashing is a crucial procedure for preventing nosocomial infections. According to 'Handwashing practices for the prevention of nosocomial infections', personnel should wash their hands before and after significant contact with patients. The document also suggests that antiseptic agents may be used before surgery and in the care of newborn infants, but soap and water are sufficient for other handwashing. In 'A rapid method for the presurgical cleansing of hands', a 90-second jet wash was found to be more effective than a 10-minute standard brush scrub in degerming the hands. The document 'Microbiological verification of the cleanliness of the hands in surgery' presents a technique for sampling organisms on the hands and evaluates the effectiveness of different products for washing the hands. Finally, 'Failure of hand disinfection with frequent hand washing: a need for prolonged field studies' highlights the importance of prolonged testing of hand washing and disinfection methods to ensure optimum final results.\n\nGiven this information, it appears that the correct sequence is to wash hands before significant contact with patients, then use an antiseptic agent if necessary (such as before surgery or in the care of newborn infants), followed by a rinse and final handwashing. The order of events would be: handwashing, antiseptic agent, rinse, and finally another round of handwashing.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
