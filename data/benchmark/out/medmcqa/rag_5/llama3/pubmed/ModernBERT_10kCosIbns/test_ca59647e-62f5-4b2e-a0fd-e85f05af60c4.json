["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the termination of a pregnancy due to hypertension. The relevant document is 'Fulminant subarachnoidal hemorrhage and coma subsequent to sudden-presenting hypertension.' This case study shows that a woman with severe hypertension (150/100 mmHg) delivered by cesarean section, followed by progressive recovery. Another relevant document is 'Blood pressure survey of Zambian primigravidae', which states that the systolic blood pressures during pregnancy were significantly lower than those of non-pregnant school girls. This suggests that high blood pressure in pregnancy is not always a concern for termination.\n\nThe question also asks about a 27-year-old primigravida, which makes me think of 'Obstetric performance in the elderly Malaysian primigravida'. The document states that there was an increased incidence of preterm delivery and malpresentation among elderly primigravidae. However, this does not directly relate to hypertension.\n\nConsidering all these points, I do not find any strong indication for terminating the pregnancy prematurely. Therefore, I would recommend allowing the pregnancy to continue until a normal term.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
