["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"After reviewing the relevant documents, I can see that there is no direct mention of Human Developmental Index (HDI) in the provided texts. However, I noticed that the document 'Characterisation of health and social development' talks about constructing comparative indices to assess the relative performance of less developed countries in their health, demographic, and economic sectors. This approach reduces problems usually associated with such indices, like arbitrary weighting of their components.\n\nFurthermore, the document '[Health indexes and \"sanimetry\": conceptual aspects of recent research on the measurement of a population's state of health]' reviews major health indexes based on classical concepts of mortality and morbidity, emphasizing their limitations.\n\nConsidering this information, I believe that the HDI is likely to be a composite measure that uses life expectancy at birth, infant morality, and quality of life as its components.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
