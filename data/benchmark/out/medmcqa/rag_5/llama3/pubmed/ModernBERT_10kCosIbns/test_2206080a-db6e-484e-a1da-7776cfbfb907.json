["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe orbital fractures, reconstruction of the orbit after destruction by tumours, and removal of foreign bodies. In this case, a metal rod was inserted into the superior orbital fissure, causing damage. The superior orbital fissure is a narrow channel that separates the greater wing of the sphenoid bone from the lesser wing. This region is responsible for transmitting nerves that control eye movement (oculomotor nerve) and vision (ophthalmic nerve). A metal rod inserted into this area would likely cause damage to these nerves.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B: Occulomotor and ophthalmic nerve\"\n}"]
