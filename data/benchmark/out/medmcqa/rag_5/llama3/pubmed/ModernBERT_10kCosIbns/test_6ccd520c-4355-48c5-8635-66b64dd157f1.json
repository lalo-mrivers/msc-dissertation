["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the anteroposterior relation of jaws. We need to analyze the provided documents to find relevant information about how this relation is measured. From the document '[Critical evaluation of the ANB angle]', we can see that the ANB angle (A-Nasion-Ba) depends on the anteroposterior relationship of the jawbones, maxillary inclination and maxillary prognathism, as well as facial dimensions. This information suggests that the ANB angle is a measure of the anteroposterior relation of jaws.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
