["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the given information about diagnostic virology and reviews on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technology, I understand that PCR is a useful tool for detecting viruses in various samples such as cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), tissues, and blood. It's also mentioned that PCR promises to add a new practical dimension to diagnostic virology.\n\nConsidering the options provided, I will analyze each scenario: A person with hepatitis B on Tenofovir therapy might require monitoring of viral load through PCR; in HSV-causing temporal encephalitis, PCR can help diagnose the condition; for BK virus in an allograft renal transplant patient, PCR might be useful to monitor the infection. CMV PCR in a liver transplant patient's blood is also important for diagnosis and monitoring.\n\nThe only scenario where viral load done by Real-Time PCR seems to have no role is D: CMV PCR in blood of patient of liver transplant. Liver transplant patients are already being monitored through PCR, but this scenario doesn't specifically require the knowledge of viral load.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
