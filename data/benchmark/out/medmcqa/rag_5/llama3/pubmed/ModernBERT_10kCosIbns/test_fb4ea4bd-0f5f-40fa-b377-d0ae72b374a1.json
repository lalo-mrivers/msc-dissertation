["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about conditions where oral screen should NOT be used. The provided documents are related to screening, endoscopy, infection control, disinfection of equipment, and primary medical care. There is no mention of nail biting habit, tongue thrusting, or thumb sucking in these documents. Therefore, the answer must be one of the options that are not related to oral screen. Option C (Acute infection of tonsils and adenoids) might seem relevant to oral health, but it's not directly related to oral screening. The other two options are also not relevant to oral health.\n\nThe correct answer is the condition that requires no oral screening, which is not mentioned in the provided documents. However, considering the theme of the question (screening), it's reasonable to infer that the correct answer is one that does not require or involve oral screening. Therefore, option C (Acute infection of tonsils and adenoids) is the most logical choice.\n\nHence, based on the given information, the answer is C: Acute infection of tonsils and adenoids.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"]
