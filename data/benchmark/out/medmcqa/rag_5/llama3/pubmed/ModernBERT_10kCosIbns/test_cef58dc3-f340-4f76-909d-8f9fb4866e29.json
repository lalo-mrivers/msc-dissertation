["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The pivot shift test is mentioned in the first document as being related to the configuration of the lateral tibial plateau. Since it's an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tear study, I'm going to look for a connection between the ACL and the pivot shift test. In the second document, medial and anterior-posterior ligament stability is discussed, but there's no direct link found between these ligaments and the pivot shift test. The third document talks about external rotational instability, which seems unrelated to the pivot shift test. The fourth document discusses mechanics of the knee, but it doesn't mention the pivot shift test either. The only remaining option is the first document, which mentions a connection between the history of instability symptoms and the pivot shift sign, so I'll look at that further.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
