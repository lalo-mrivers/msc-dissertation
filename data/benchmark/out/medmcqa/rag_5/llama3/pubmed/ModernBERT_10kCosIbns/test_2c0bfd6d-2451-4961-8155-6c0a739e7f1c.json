["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks which statement about tRNA molecules is false. From the given documents, we can analyze each option: A) The enzyme that attaches an amino acid to a tRNA is aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase - True (Source: On the dynamic model of tRNA: recent experimental findings). B) Although composed of a single strand of RNA, each molecule contains several sho, double-helical regions - False (Source: Modeling RNA secondary structures. II. The geometric structural solution for tRNA.). C) The amino acid attachment is always to 3' end of the molecule. - False (Source: Compilation of tRNA sequences). D) There is at least one tRNA for each of the 2 amino acids - This statement cannot be definitively classified as true or false without further information, but based on the given documents and the concept of tRNA classification, it can be inferred that there are multiple tRNAs for each amino acid. Therefore, option B) is the most likely false statement.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
