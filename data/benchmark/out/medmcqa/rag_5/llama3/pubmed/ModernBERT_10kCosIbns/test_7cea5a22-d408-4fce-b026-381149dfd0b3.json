["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the centre of rotation during intrusion. There are no documents related to dental or oral anatomy, so we need to look for general principles or concepts that can help us answer this question.\\r\\nOne important concept is spatial orientation, which was discussed in several documents. It seems that spatial orientation mechanisms allow an organism to distinguish between changes in activity at its receptors contingent on its own movements and those resulting from movement within the environment.\\r\\nAnother relevant concept is the vestibular system, which represents one of the acceleration-sensitive receptor systems conveying spatial information. This suggests that spatial orientation is closely related to the sense of balance or equilibrium.\\r\\nConsidering these concepts, we can infer that the centre of rotation during intrusion would be at a point where the object's movement is perceived as occurring around its own axis of rotation, rather than being influenced by external factors like gravity or surrounding environment. This would mean that the centre of rotation is not at infinity, nor at any specific location within the tooth (like the CEJ), but rather at the point where the object's movement is perceived to be centered.\\r\\nFinally, considering the general principles of spatial orientation and the vestibular system, we can conclude that the centre of rotation during intrusion is likely to be outside the tooth, as this would allow for the most accurate perception of movement around its own axis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
