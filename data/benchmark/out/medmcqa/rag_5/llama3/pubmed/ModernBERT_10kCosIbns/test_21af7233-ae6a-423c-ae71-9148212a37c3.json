["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to the provided documents, calcium ions trigger muscle contraction by binding to regulatory proteins. Calcium binds to proteins containing the 'EF-hand' structural motif (Calcium binding induces conformational changes in muscle regulatory proteins) and regulates a variety of biochemical processes including muscle contraction (Molecular basis of regulation of contraction of skeletal muscle cells). The calcium-sensitive dye arsenazo III was used to measure the transient change in the sarcoplasmic concentration of Ca2+ in intact fibres isolated from the anterior tibial muscle of the frog Litoria moorei. Therefore, it is clear that calcium ions trigger muscle contraction by binding to regulatory proteins.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
