["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the provided documents, we know that Frankfort horizontal is a reference plane used for cephalometric orientation. In the document 'Orientation-sella-nasion or Frankfort horizontal', it is stated that the controversy regarding the most appropriate line for cephalometric orientation has been resolved and can be summarized in five areas of consideration. One of these considerations is the clinical significance, where the ability to visualize the Frankfort horizontal plane affords clinicians effective communication. This suggests that Frankfort horizontal is a reference plane that can be constructed by joining specific landmarks. The other documents do not provide direct information on how to construct the Frankfort horizontal plane. Therefore, we must rely on our understanding of anatomy and cephalometric orientation to determine which landmarks are used to construct this plane.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
