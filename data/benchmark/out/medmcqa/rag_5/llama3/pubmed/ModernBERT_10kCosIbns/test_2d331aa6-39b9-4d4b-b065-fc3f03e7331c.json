["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the mechanism by which LA acts on nerve membranes. Based on the provided documents, we know that N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors are found in highest concentrations in laminae I and II of the dorsal horn. We also know that AMPA receptors are present in this region. Since LA is a excitatory amino acid receptor agonist, it likely acts on these receptors to produce an effect.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
