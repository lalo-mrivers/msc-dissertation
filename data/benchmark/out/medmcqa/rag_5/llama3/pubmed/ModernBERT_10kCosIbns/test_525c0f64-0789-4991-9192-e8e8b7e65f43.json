["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking what good contacts in primary teeth with lack of spacing predict. The relevant documents mention the importance of considering molar, canine, and incisor relationships when analyzing tooth spacing or crowding. In the stage of mixed dentition, estimates of the size of unerupted teeth are more accurate than estimates of future spacing or crowding because the perimeter of the arch does not diminish the same amount in all cases. This suggests that lack of spacing in primary teeth may indicate a tendency towards crowding in permanent teeth.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B: Crowding in permanent teeth\"\n}"]
