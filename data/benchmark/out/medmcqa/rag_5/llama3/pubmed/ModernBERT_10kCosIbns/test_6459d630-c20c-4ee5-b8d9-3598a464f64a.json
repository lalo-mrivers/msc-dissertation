["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to the document 'The mural ameloblastoma: a review of the literature', we can see that the frequency of recurrence after simple enucleation of the cyst containing this lesion is considerably lower than that for ameloblastomas in general. This suggests that the recurrence rate for multicystic ameloblastoma after surgical enucleation might be lower than average. Additionally, the document 'Unicystic ameloblastoma: a prognostically distinct entity' mentions that the rate of recurrence for unicystic lesions was distinctly lower than that associated with multicystic character of the lesion throughout its course, indicating that unicystic lesions have a better prognosis compared to multicystic ones. This information can help us estimate the recurrence rate for multicystic ameloblastoma after surgical enucleation.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
