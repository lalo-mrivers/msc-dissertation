["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to the provided documents, high copper amalgam alloys generally possess the greatest strength at all times of testing. The major increase in strength takes place between one hour and one day. This suggests that high copper amalgams have a characteristic feature of developing strength rapidly. Additionally, anodic corrosion activity previously reported for a high copper amalgam must result from the presence of the gamma2 phase or tin in the matrix phase.\", \"answer_choice\": C}"]
