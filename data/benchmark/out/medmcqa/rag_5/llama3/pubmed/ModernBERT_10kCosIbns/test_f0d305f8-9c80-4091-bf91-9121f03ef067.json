["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents provided describe the prevalence of various oral bacteria and their relationship with periodontitis. The most striking difference is seen for Porphyromonas gingivalis, which was found in 38.8% of blacks and 9.4% of whites. Similar relationships were found when the percent of sites with these organisms were assessed. Blacks with P. gingivalis or P. intermedia had a higher prevalence of sites with LA greater than or equal to 7 mm as compared to blacks not infected with P. gingivalis or P. intermedia. The same was true for whites. This suggests that P. gingivalis plays a significant role in periodontitis.\n\nThe other options, Actinomyces, Spirocheates, and Bacteriodes, are not mentioned as having any specific relationship to periodontitis or oral flora in the provided documents.\", \n\"answer_choice\": \"D: Bacteriodes\"\n}"]
