["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the direction of force that can cause certain effects. The relevant documents discuss human tolerance to impact acceleration, biomechanics of the impact interaction of a blunt solid object and the human head, reaction of a human head/neck/torso system to shock, standardization of experimental impact injury to the spinal cord, and cerebral accident subsequent to G-force loading. The key point is that the direction of force is critical in determining the effects on the body. In longer impacts, it is the level of acceleration which is critical, resulting from the dynamic characteristics of the body which can be represented as a simple mass spring system. Therefore, it can be inferred that the direction of force causing cerebral accident subsequent to G-force loading is related to G-force loading.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
