The first document talks about adverse effects of stationary grids on image quality. It states that several contributing factors were found, but it doesn't specify what those factors are. However, it does mention that the fact that grid strips are not clearly visible in the film actually demonstrates that image quality is so low that even the grid lines are not perceptible.
