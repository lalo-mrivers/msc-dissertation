["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about Golgi tendon organ's role during voluntary movements. We can see from the documents that Golgi tendon organs are sensitive to subtle alterations in motor unit twitch waveform and amplitude (The response of Golgi tendon organs to single motor unit contractions). They also respond to forces produced by single motor units, with an absolute force threshold as little as 4 mg (Responses of isolated Golgi tendon organs of the cat). Additionally, each Golgi tendon organ appears to be sensitive to the contraction of every motor unit in a muscle (Heterogeneity of motor units activating single Golgi tendon organs in cat leg muscles). Therefore, we can conclude that the Golgi tendon organ continuously relays to the efferent neurons information about tension in the muscle.\", \"answer_choice\": D}"]
