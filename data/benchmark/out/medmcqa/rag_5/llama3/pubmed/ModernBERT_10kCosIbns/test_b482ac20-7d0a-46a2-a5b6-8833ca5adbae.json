["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the unique anticariogenic property of most silicate cements. The documents provided describe various studies on silicate cements, including their composition, interaction with oral cavity walls, and effects on cells. There is no mention of beryllium flux in any of these studies.
