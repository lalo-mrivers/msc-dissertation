["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about nodal metastasis that cannot be seen on a CT scan. From the provided documents, we know that the study on regional lymph node metastases in carcinoma of the left side of the colon and rectum used routine CT scans to show the distribution of regional lymph node metastases. However, this document does not mention anything about spiculated nodes, size more than 6 mm, necrotic nodes or rounded nodes. Therefore, we need to look at other documents that might provide information on these options.\n\nThe document on occult metastasis in lymph nodes mentions the maximum diameter of the metastatic foci varying from 0.2 mm to 1.3 mm and being less than 0.5 mm in more than half of the nodes. This suggests that small nodal metastases may not be detected by CT scans, especially if they are smaller than the resolution of the scanner.\n\nBased on this information, we can infer that a rounded node or a necrotic node might not be seen on a CT scan if it is small enough. However, spiculated nodes and size more than 6 mm do not seem to be related to the detectability of nodal metastases by CT scans, so options A and B are unlikely to be correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be D: Rounded node or C: Necrotic node.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
