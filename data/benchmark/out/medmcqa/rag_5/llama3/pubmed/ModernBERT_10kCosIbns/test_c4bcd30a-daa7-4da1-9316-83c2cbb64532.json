["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the location of the contractile element in a skeletal muscle. The relevant document that provides information about this topic is 'Muscle structure and function--an explanation'. According to this document, contraction takes place by a sliding filament mechanism produced by cross-bridges which form between thick and thin filaments. This suggests that the contractile element is present in the myofibril, which is the structural unit of muscle fibers.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"]
