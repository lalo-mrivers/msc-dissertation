["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the role of Streptococcus mutans (S. mutans) in dental caries development. S. mutans is known to adhere to tooth surfaces and contribute to caries development. This is evident from studies that have shown a strong positive correlation between detectable lesions and S. mutans presence. Furthermore, the study on the diffusion of acidic and alkaline agents into natural human caries lesions in vitro suggests that the lesion fluid is close to saturation with respect to enamel apatite, indicating the involvement of acid-producing bacteria like S. mutans.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
