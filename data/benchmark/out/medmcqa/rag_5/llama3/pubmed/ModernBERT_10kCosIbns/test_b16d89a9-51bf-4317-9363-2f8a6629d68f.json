["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the studies on fluoride distribution in infants and small children, we can see that fluorine (F) concentrations were determined in biopsy and autopsy specimens from fetuses, infants, and children on varying F intake. In newborn autopsy cases, the F concentrations of bone and dentin were of the same order, those of enamel lower. Correlations between individual F values in different tissues were all positive, highest for enamel/dentin. This suggests that fluoride is absorbed mainly through the oral cavity.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
