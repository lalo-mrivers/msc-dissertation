["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the review on pre-messenger RNA and transcriptions, we know that primary pre-mRNA is processed into secondary pre-mRNAs by extragenic cleavage and intragenic processing, giving rise to functional mRNA.

These are the post-transcriptional modifications mentioned in the review. The other options do not match these modifications.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
