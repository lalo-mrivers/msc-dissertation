["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents mention the use of heparin for thromboprophylaxis. In one document, it is mentioned that a low-molecular-weight heparin was used once daily subcutaneously in a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study. This suggests that the subcutaneous route may be commonly used.

The other options (inhaling and intramuscular) are not relevant in this context.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
