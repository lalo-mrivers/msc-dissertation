["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the aetiology of dental caries as being influenced by factors such as tooth's resistance to caries attack, chemical nature of the enamel surface, and microflora. The concept of 'cariosity gradient' is also mentioned in the log-linear analysis. Considering these factors, it seems that the lateral spread of dental caries would be facilitated by the microbial composition of plaque or the microflora. This is supported by the findings of the longitudinal epidemiological study which shows a rise in the isolation frequency and mean numbers of S. mutans after detection of caries.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
