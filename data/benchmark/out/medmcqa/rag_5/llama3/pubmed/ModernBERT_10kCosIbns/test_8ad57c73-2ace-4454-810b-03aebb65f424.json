["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the isolation of highly purified lysosomes from rat liver, identification of electron carrier components on lysosomal membranes, and turnover studies on proteins of rat liver lysosomes. The documents also discuss the properties of membrane proteins of rat liver lysosomes, including that most of them are exposed to the cytoplasm. Reactive oxygen metabolites are mentioned in the context of hemochromes in lysosomes showing spectra similar to that of a b-type cytochrome. Considering this information, it is likely that reactive oxygen metabolite in lysosomes is released by NADPH oxidase, which is responsible for generating reactive oxygen species.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
