["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the documents provided, we can see that the ultrastructure of striated skeletal muscle reveals that the contractile system consists of thick and thin filaments arranged side by side in a double network. Myosin is an enzyme catalysing the hydrolysis of ATP; actin increases the specific activity of this enzyme. Hydrolysis of the last phosphoryl group of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) salts is the energy source for muscle contraction.\n\nIn the study on fast and slow nuclear bag fibres and nuclear chain fibres in isolated cat muscle spindles, we see that intrafusal muscle fibres are of three functional types. Most spindles contain one slow nuclear bag fibre, one fast nuclear bag fibre, and four or five nuclear chain fibres.\n\nThe histoenzymatic study of rat intrafusal muscle fibres reveals the histochemical activities of myofibrillar adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase), succinic dehydrogenase (SDH) and alpha glycerophosphate dehydrogenase (alpha-GPD).\n\nA technique for studies of the contractile apparatus in single human muscle fibre segments obtained by percutaneous biopsy reveals that the force generating-capacity, the sensitivity of the contractile apparatus to calcium and the caffeine threshold for calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum could be studied in the short muscle fibre segments.\n\nFrom these documents, it is clear that the contractile part of intrafusal fibres refers to the thick filaments (myosin) and thin filaments (actin) arranged side by side in a double network, which are responsible for muscle contraction.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: Both\"\n}"]
