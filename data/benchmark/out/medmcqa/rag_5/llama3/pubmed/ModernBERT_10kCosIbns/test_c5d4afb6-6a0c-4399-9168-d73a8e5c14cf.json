["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is 5 years and 4 months old with a small chin, distal step 2nd molar relation, narrow maxillary width, normal SNA angle, decreased SNB angle, and low FMA angle.

The study 'The human chin and its relationship to mandibular morphology' suggests that with dental 'hypofunction' in combination with an exaggerated vertical development of the mandible, a smaller proportion of the protruding chin is present.
