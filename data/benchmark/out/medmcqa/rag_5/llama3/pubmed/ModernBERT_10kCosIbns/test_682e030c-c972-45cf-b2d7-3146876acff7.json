["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about statements that are true for idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP). According to the documents provided, ITP is characterized by platelet-specific auto-antibodies. This is supported by [Clinical picture, pathophysiology and therapy of idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (author's transl)]. Additionally, Bacterial infections and thrombocytopenia in chronic idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura suggests that bacterial infections can precipitate or contain episodes of thrombocytopenia. Furthermore, [8 cases of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura] emphasizes the significance of freshly frozen plasma administration in the treatment of this disease, which may imply that prolonged bleeding time is a possibility. Lastly, while immunosuppressive treatment can be used to treat ITP, its effectiveness is low and transient, as mentioned in A multicenter prospective study on the treatment of chronic idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura. Finally, [Immune thrombocytopenic purpura: an overview] mentions that ITP has many causes, most of which precipitate an immunologic reaction.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
