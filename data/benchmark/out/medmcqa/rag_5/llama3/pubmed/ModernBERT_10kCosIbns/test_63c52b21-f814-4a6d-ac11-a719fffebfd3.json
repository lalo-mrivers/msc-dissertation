["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for radiolucent stones, which means the stones will appear less dense or transparent on a radiological image. The documents provided discuss various types of stones and their composition. Calcium oxalate, calcium phosphate, and hydroxyapatite stones are mentioned as common stone-forming substances. Additionally, uric acid stones are mentioned, but not in the context of being radiolucent.
