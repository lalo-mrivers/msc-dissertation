["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, mantle cell lymphoma is characterized by its immunophenotypic features. The documents describe the common features of mantle zone malignant lymphomas, including the presence of small cell blastic (centrocytoid) malignant lymphoma cells with lymphoepithelial lesions and angioinvasion. The study also discusses the immunohistochemical features of mantle zone lymphoma, which include LN-1-(+), LN-2+(+-)++, sIgM+, sIgD+, CALLA +/-(-)+, DRC-1+(-)++. Additionally, the documents describe the clinical and pathologic characteristics of mantle zone lymphoma, including its slow progression and low-grade nature. Based on this information, it is likely that a new marker for mantle cell lymphoma would be related to these immunophenotypic features.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
