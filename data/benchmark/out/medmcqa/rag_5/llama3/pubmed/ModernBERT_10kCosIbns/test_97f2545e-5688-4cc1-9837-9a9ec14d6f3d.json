["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking how basophils are activated. From the documents provided, it can be seen that basophils contain and release histamine, the eosinophil chemotactic factor of anaphylaxis (ECFA), a slow reacting substance of anaphylaxis (SRS-A), and a kallikrein. The release process is controlled by hormone-basophil receptor interactions that determine the cyclic AMP level; plasma and tissue adenosine levels appear prominent in this control. Histamine feeds back to negatively modulate basophil and mast cell release through a specific histamine 2-receptor; it also inhibits lymphocyte and neutrophil function. Therefore, based on this information, it can be concluded that the activation of basophils is not related to IL-5, neutrophils, or killer inhibitory peptide.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: Cell fixed IgE\"\n}"]
