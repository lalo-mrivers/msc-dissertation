["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the best way to fill a bony defect. From the given documents, it's clear that various methods have been discussed for filling osseous defects, including local treatment with flap transfers, free flap transfers, cancellous bone grafting, and vascularized bone grafts. The review of bone grafting for reconstruction of discontinuity defects of the mandible also highlights different types of autogenous bone grafting.\n\nBased on these discussions, it's apparent that using the patient's own bone (autograft) is a viable option. This approach has been successful in treating bony defects after soft tissue reconstruction and has even been suggested as the method of choice for cranial defect repair.\n\nIn contrast, hydroxy apatite, xenograft, and donor graft are not explicitly mentioned as methods for filling bony defects in these documents.\", \n\"answer_choice\": \"D: Autograft\""]
