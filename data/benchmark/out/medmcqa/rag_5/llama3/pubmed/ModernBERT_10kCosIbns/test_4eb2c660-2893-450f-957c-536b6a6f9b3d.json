["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The concept of feedback is crucial in understanding the mechanisms that regulate biological systems. Feedback loops can be either positive or negative, and they have different effects on the system. In this case, we are looking for an example of a feedforward mechanism, which involves the transmission of signals from one layer to another without any feedback. Based on the provided documents, it seems that options C (Salivation on smelling food) and D (Increase blood pressure during supine posture) might not be directly related to feedback mechanisms. Option A (Feeling thirsty while walking in hot temperature) could be an example of a feedforward mechanism, but it is not explicitly mentioned in the provided documents.\n\nLooking at the document about command neurons in Pleurobranchaea, we can see that there is synaptic feedback from the motor network to the command neurons. This suggests that the system has a feedback mechanism rather than a feedforward one. Therefore, option C (Salivation on smelling food) seems to be the most relevant choice.\n\nThe documents do not mention anything about temperature and blood pressure. The focus is more on biological systems and their regulation through feedback loops.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
