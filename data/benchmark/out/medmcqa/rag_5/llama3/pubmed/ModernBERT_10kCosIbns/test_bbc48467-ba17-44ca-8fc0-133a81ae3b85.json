["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents discuss factors related to strength and growth in male adolescents. The first document describes a strength index composed of handgrip and back strengths, which was positively related to anthropometric measurements and negatively related to percentage of fat. The second document discusses growth velocity of lean body mass and fat in adolescent boys, showing that the maximum yearly increment in height, weight, and lean body mass coincided in time.\n\nThe third document evaluates growth hormone response in very short children, concluding that standardized exercise is as effective as L-DOPA/P as a stimulation test for growth hormone response. The fourth document discusses stimulation of growth hormone secretion by physical exercise, finding that physical exercise as HGH stimulus is a good screening test.\n\nBased on these documents, we can conclude that the increase in muscle mass at adolescence is probably caused by Growth Hormone.\", \"answer_choice\": C}"]
