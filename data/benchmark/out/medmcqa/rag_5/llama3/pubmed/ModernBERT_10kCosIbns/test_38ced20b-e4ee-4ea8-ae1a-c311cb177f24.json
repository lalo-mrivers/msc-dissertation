["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"After reviewing the provided documents, we can see that progressive external root resorption was observed on the buccal surface of a tooth. The Physiological root resorption of primary molars study suggests that root resorption starts during the exfoliative process. However, it does not specify the exact age at which this process begins.\n\nThe Factors regulating and modifying dental root resorption document states that the root resorption that occurs at the shedding of the primary teeth is induced in a different way possibly by substance(s) from the reduced enamel epithelium. This suggests that root resorption may occur during tooth development, but it does not provide a specific age.\n\nThe effects of root shape and biology on bone growth study does not mention root resorption or its relation to age.\n\nBased on this information, we can infer that root resorption starts during the exfoliative process, which is likely to occur after 5 years of age.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A: 5 years\""]
