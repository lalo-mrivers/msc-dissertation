["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The increase in height of mandible with increase in interdental spaces is related to the osteo-neural concept.

This phenomenon is supported by a model experiment. Therefore, there is no relationship between the increase in height of mandible and hyper/hypopituitarism, thyroidism or parathyroidism.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"None of the above\""]
