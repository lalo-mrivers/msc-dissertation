["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the type of lipase controlled by glucagon. We can look at the provided documents for relevant information. In the 'Regulation of liver cell volume and proteolysis by glucagon and insulin' document, it is mentioned that glucagon did not inhibit the activity of acetyl-CoA carboxylase, which is an enzyme involved in fatty acid biosynthesis. This suggests that glucagon does not directly control lipogenesis.\n\nIn the 'Regulation of hepatic free fatty acid metabolism by glucagon and insulin' document, it is stated that glucagon increased ketogenesis and decreased triglyceride synthesis from palmitate in hepatocytes from fed rats at FFA concentrations 1.0 mM or less. This implies that glucagon may be involved in the regulation of lipolysis.\n\nThe 'In vivo effects of glucagon on fatty acid synthesis in fasted and refed rats' document does not provide specific information about the type of lipase controlled by glucagon.\n\nHowever, we can look at the 'Effects of glucagon and insulin on fatty acid synthesis and glycogen degradation in the perfused liver of normal and genetically obese (ob/ob) mice' document, which states that glucagon did not inhibit the activity of acetyl-CoA carboxylase, but it is proposed that the action of glucagon on hepatic fatty acid biosynthesis could be secondary in time to depletion of glycogen. This suggests that glucagon may be involved in regulating lipolysis rather than lipogenesis.\n\nConsidering these findings, we can conclude that glucagon is likely to control hormone-sensitive lipase, which is involved in lipolysis.\", \n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
