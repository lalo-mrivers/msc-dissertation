["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents discuss various types of temporomandibular joint (TMJ) ankylosis, including posttraumatic, postinfective, and reankylosis. They also describe the surgical treatment options and the importance of early treatment. None of the documents mention calcification in the soft tissues around the joint space as a theory of TMJ ankylosis. Similarly, synovial fluid attracting calcium ions is not mentioned as a cause of ankylosis. Lateral displacement of fracture condyle with fusion with zygomatic bone and condylar burst are also not theories discussed in the documents. Therefore, it can be concluded that calcification in the soft tissues around the joint space is not a theory of TMJ ankylosis.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
