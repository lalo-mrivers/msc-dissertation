["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the provided documents, we know that plane xanthomas are associated with increased vascular permeability and serum lipoprotein(a) concentration. We also know that hyperlipoproteinemias may be either primary or secondary to other diseases. The boy presented with severe abdominal pain and had a milky appearance of plasma in his blood sample. Given this information, we can conclude that the boy likely has a form of hyperlipoproteinemia. The relevant document for this case is 'Xanthomas and lipoproteins', which states that the four types of xanthomas include tendinous, tuberous, eruptive, and planar. Since the boy has plane xanthoma, we can infer that he likely has a form of hyperlipoproteinemia type III. According to the document 'Structure and morphogenesis of xanthomas in hyperlipoproteinemia type III', this type of xanthoma is induced by pathological plasma lipoproteins.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
