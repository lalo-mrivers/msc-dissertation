["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the percentage of phosphoric acid where Dicalcium phosphate monohydrate is formed that cannot be rinsed off. The relevant document is 'The seeded growth of calcium phosphates.' According to this document, dicalcium phosphate dihydrate (DCPD) crystallization takes place on the surface of these solids in all cases. Since we are looking for the percentage where DCPD monohydrate is formed that cannot be rinsed off, we can assume it's a similar process. We don't have any information about phosphoric acid being used as a substrate or having a direct impact on the formation of DCPD monohydrate. Therefore, we cannot make a direct connection between the two.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
