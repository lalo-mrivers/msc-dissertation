["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents discuss the effect of filler particles on the properties of light-curing composites. From Metal-filled resin composites. II., it is mentioned that different fillers can alter or prevent polymerization, and some can even accelerate it. This suggests that the size of the filler particle may influence the physical properties of the composite. In Filler particle size and composite resin classification systems, the wear values were easily correlated with the groupings of materials based on their filler particle sizes. This implies that different sizes of filler particles may affect the wear resistance of composites. Therefore, it is possible that increased size of filler particles in composite can influence its properties.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
