["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the duct of parotid gland. According to the text 'Cysts, masses, and tumors of the accessory parotid gland. An accessory parotid gland occurs in approximately 21 percent of human subjects. It is located anterior to the main parotid gland, usually just above Stensen's duct and connected by its own duct to the latter.' Stensen's duct is mentioned as being connected to the main parotid gland. Then it's stated that 'For the excision of lesions of the accessory parotid gland, we prefer to turn the same cervicofacial flap used for a lateral or total parotidectomy. This permits one to fully visualize the superficial and deep main parotid segments, the trunk and the branches of the facial nerve, and the accessory parotid gland along with its duct system and Stensen's duct.' This means that the duct of the parotid gland is mentioned as being connected to the main parotid gland. Then it's stated that 'It is located anterior to the main parotid gland, usually just above Stensen's duct and connected by its own duct to the latter.' Therefore, this information provides us with the answer.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
