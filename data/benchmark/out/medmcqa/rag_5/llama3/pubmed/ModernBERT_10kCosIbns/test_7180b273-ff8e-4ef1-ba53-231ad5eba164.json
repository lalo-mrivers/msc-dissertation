["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about a 19-year-old patient with a swelling over the left angle of the mandible, temperature of 38Â°C and negative history of trauma. Given these symptoms, I would rule out D: Sjogren's syndrome as it is an autoimmune disorder characterized by dry mouth and eyes, which does not seem to match the presented symptoms.\n\nI would also eliminate C: Mumps, as it typically affects children under 15 years old, and the patient in question is 19.\n\nAs for A: Spontaneous fracture of the mandible, while possible, I think it's less likely given that there is no history of trauma.\n\nB: Pericoronal infection seems more plausible, especially considering the swelling over the left angle of the mandible. This could be a sign of an inflammatory process in the soft tissues or perhaps even an underlying bone disease.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
