["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents discuss the biology of Hodgkin's disease and the nature of Reed-Sternberg cells. The most recent investigations have provided new information on the biological nature and cellular origin of Hodgkin and Reed-Sternberg cells (H-RS). Immunophenotypic analyses suggest a lymphoid cell expressing T- and/or B-cell-associated markers, while molecular genetic studies demonstrate heterogeneous findings with respect to rearrangements of T-cell receptor and immunoglobulin genes. Additionally, the presence of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) genomes in H-RS cells is reported. The significance of these findings remains to be elucidated. Furthermore, recent studies suggest that Reed-Sternberg cells may be derived from a macrophage.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
