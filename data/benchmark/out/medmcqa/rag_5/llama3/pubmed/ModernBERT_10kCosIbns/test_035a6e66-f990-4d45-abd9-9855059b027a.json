["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking which of the options is least likely to cause infective endocarditis. We can look at the documents for clues about common causative agents. The first document mentions various organisms being responsible in different patient populations, but does not specifically mention any of the options. The second document talks about resistant organisms and Streptococcus viridans being found in 40% of cases, but again does not mention the specific options. The third document is a study on infective endocarditis and mentions staphylococcus as a common cause (50% of blood cultures), but does not specifically mention the other options. The fourth document mentions Streptococcus viridans being responsible for many cases, but again does not mention the specific options. Based on this information, we can infer that staphylococcus is a likely cause of infective endocarditis. Looking at the options, Staphylococcus albus is actually a correct identification, as it is mentioned in one of the documents. Therefore, we should look for an option that is less commonly associated with infective endocarditis.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
