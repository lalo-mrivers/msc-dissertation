["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about anti-tubercular drugs that can cause ophthalmological toxicity. The provided documents are related to side effects of anti-tubercular drugs and toxic changes induced by antituberculous drugs in the digestive organs. There is no specific information about ophthalmological complications due to individual anti-tubercular drugs. However, one case report [Hazards of antitubercular treatment--case report] mentions severe corneal lesions caused by Vincaleukoblastin (Velbe), but this is not an anti-tubercular drug for treating tuberculosis.
