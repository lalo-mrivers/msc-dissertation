["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents describe various mechanical systems involving bone structures. The first document discusses the distribution of material density and mechanical stress in the human radius during bending. It doesn't specifically mention forces applied on lateral surfaces at angle regions, so we can't infer compression location from this document. The second document is about a model of force transmission in tibio-femoral contact and doesn't relate to our question either. The third document describes external skeletal fixation with continuous adjustment of stability, but it's not focused on forces applied on lateral surfaces at angle regions. The fourth document discusses biomechanical investigations of osteosynthesis at metaphys area of tibia and femur with self-tensed angle plates. It explains that an overbending or additional angle allowance is necessary to achieve uniform distribution of power transmission, but it doesn't specify the location of compression.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
