["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant document is [Master genes in mammalian repetitive DNA amplification]. The document discusses the analysis of species-specific subfamilies of both the LINE and SINE mammalian repetitive DNA families. It suggests that such subfamilies have arisen by amplification of an extremely small group of 'master' genes. This implies that there are specific genes that code for receptors in the mammalian genome. The other options do not seem to be directly related to receptor coding.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
