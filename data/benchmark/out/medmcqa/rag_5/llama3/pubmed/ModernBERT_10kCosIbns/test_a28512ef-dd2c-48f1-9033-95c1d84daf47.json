["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's presentation of imbalance on walking with eyes closed suggests a possible vestibular disorder. The fact that the patient has to lift up their foot and stomp on ground to walk implies that the patient is having difficulty maintaining balance and proprioception during walking. This information, along with the patient's symptoms, points towards the involvement of the vestibular system. Therefore, we can deduce that the tract involved is likely related to the processing of vestibular information.\n\nUpon reviewing the relevant documents, we find that the Vestibulospinal tract is responsible for transmitting proprioceptive and vestibular information from the inner ear to the spinal cord, which then regulates posture and balance. This tract plays a crucial role in maintaining equilibrium and preventing falls.\n\nGiven this information, it is likely that the patient's symptoms are related to an abnormality in the Vestibulospinal tract.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
