["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents discuss the immunobiological activity of glucan, its ability to modify the mortality of mice with experimentally induced Gram-positive bacteremia, and enhancement in serum lysozyme and phagocytic activity. Additionally, it highlights the role of glucan as a mediator of antibacterial activity, increasing serum lysozyme concentrations sevenfold over control concentrations. This information suggests that glucan is involved in enhancing host defense against bacterial infections, particularly Gram-positive ones.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
