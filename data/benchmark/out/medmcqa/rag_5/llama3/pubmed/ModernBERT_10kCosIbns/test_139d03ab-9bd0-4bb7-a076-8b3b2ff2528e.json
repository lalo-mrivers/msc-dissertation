["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks for a cross-linking fixative that is not among the given options. We can analyze each option to determine which one is not a cross-linking fixative. Osmium tetroxide and Glutaraldehyde are both known as fixatives in biochemistry, used to preserve tissue samples. Methanol is an organic solvent, but it's not a fixative. Formaldehyde is also a well-known fixative, commonly used in histology to preserve tissues for microscopic examination.\n\nThe relevant documents provided discuss cross-linking agents and their effects on various materials, including gelatin microspheres, proteins, and poly(methylmethacrylate) resin. None of the options mention Osmium tetroxide as a fixative, but it is commonly used as a fixative in biochemistry.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C: Methanol.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
