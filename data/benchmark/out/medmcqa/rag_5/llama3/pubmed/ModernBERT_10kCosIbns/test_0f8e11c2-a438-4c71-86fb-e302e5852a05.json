["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the provided documents, we know that achondroplasia is an autosomal dominant condition. Since both parents have achondroplasia, they are both carriers of the mutated allele. The probability of having an unaffected baby depends on the chance of passing the normal allele to each child. As both parents are carriers, there is a 50% chance that either parent can pass the mutated allele to each child. Therefore, the chances of having an unaffected baby are calculated as follows: 50% (chance of receiving the normal allele from one parent) x 50% (chance of receiving the normal allele from the other parent) = 25%. This means that there is a 25% chance of having an unaffected baby.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
