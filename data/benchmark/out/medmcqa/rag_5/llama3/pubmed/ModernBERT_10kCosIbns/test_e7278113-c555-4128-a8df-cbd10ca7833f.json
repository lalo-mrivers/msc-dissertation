["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The problem is to find the amount of drug remaining after 6 hours. First, we need to find out how much drug is eliminated from the body in one hour. Since 75 mg of the drug is eliminated in 90 minutes, that means 1/2 hour or 30 minutes, 25 mg of the drug is eliminated. So, the rate of elimination is 25 mg per 30 minutes, which is equal to 1.67 mg per minute. Now we can calculate how much drug will be eliminated after 6 hours (360 minutes). It's 1.67 mg/minute * 360 minutes = 603 mg. The total amount of drug administered is 200 mg, so the remaining amount is 200 - 603 = -403. This is not possible because you can't have a negative amount of drug. Therefore, we need to find out how much drug will remain if all the drug is eliminated after 6 hours. Since the rate of elimination is constant, the same rate of elimination applies in the first hour. So, in one hour, 1.67 mg of the drug will be eliminated, and the remaining amount will be 200 - 1.67 = 198.33 mg. This process continues for 6 hours. In each hour, 1.67 mg of the drug is eliminated, so after 6 hours, a total of 10.02 mg (6 * 1.67) of the drug will be eliminated. Therefore, the remaining amount of drug is 200 - 10.02 = 190.02 mg.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
