["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The key point is that one parent is homozygous (has two copies of the recessive allele) and the other parent is heterozygous (has one copy of the recessive allele and one copy of a different allele). Since autosomal recessive disorders require two copies of the recessive allele to express, we need to determine which genotype combinations will result in an affected child. The possible genotypes for each child are: - HH from both parents (no chance of being affected) - Hh from the heterozygous parent and H or h from the homozygous parent - hh from the homozygous parent - Hh from the heterozygous parent and H or h from the homozygous parent Since the child can inherit either an 'H' or 'h' allele from each parent, we need to determine which genotypes will result in the hh combination. The probability of this occurring is 1/2 (since one half of the gametes from the heterozygous parent will be 'h') and 1 (since all the gametes from the homozygous parent will be 'h'). Therefore, the chance of a child being affected (hh) is 1/2 * 1 = 1/2 or 50%. The remaining children will be Hh, which means they are carriers of the recessive allele but not affected. Thus, the outcome is that 50% children will be affected and rest will be carriers.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
