["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the maximum alveolar-arterial oxygen difference. From the given documents, we can find that stratification plays an important role in giving rise to stratificational gradients of O2 in distal airways. In particular, for 10 kg dogs breathing hypoxic mixtures, the stratificational component of the alveolar-arterial Po2 difference is estimated at about 0.8 torr for resting conditions and at about 3.5 torr for medium level exercise. This suggests that the maximum alveolar-arterial oxygen difference is seen in situations where there is a significant degree of stratification.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
