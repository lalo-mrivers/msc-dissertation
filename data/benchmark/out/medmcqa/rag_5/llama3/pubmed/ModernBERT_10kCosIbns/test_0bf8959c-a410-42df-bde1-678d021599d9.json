["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the anterior teeth with Mesiodistal size more than Cervicoincisal dimension. The relevant document is 'Correlations between tooth dimensions of man and apes'. This study showed that dentitions should be regarded as whole biological entities rather than a series of discrete teeth. No specific information is provided on the mesiodistal size of anterior teeth. However, we can look at the other documents to see if they provide any useful information. The document 'The distribution of nerves in human deciduous and permanent teeth' does not seem to be relevant to this question. Similarly, the documents 'Assessment of the status of endodontically treated teeth in patients with cardiovascular abnormality' and 'Mineral metabolism and microstructural defects in primate teeth' do not provide any information on the mesiodistal size of anterior teeth. Therefore, we can conclude that the only way to answer this question is by analyzing the shape and dimensions of the different types of incisors.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
