["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the inhibition of release of synaptic vesicle from presynaptic terminal. From the provided documents, we can see that the release process has an apparent threshold depolarization of 40-50 mV and saturated at presynaptic depolarizations of the order of 100 mV (Synaptic transfer at a vertebrate central nervous system synapse). This suggests that depolarization is necessary for release. Therefore, options D: Prevention of depolarization of nerve terminal seems to be a reasonable explanation.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
