["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the type of secretion of salivary gland. According to the documents provided, the major and minor salivary glands produce an enzyme- and mucin-containing primary saliva through their acinar functional system (from [Morphology of salivary gland diseases]). This process involves membrane fusion during exocytosis, as studied by freeze-fracture electron microscopy (Freeze-fracture studies of salivary glands). The secretions are also regulated by the autonomic nervous system and other factors. The minor salivary glands contribute to the composition of whole saliva through their mucous secretion, which is mainly composed of mucosubstances (Some chemical characteristics of human minor salivary gland secretions).\", \"answer_choice\": A}"]
