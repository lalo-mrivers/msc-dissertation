["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents discuss various aspects of filtration techniques used in radiography. In 'The diagnostic quality of optically processed radiographs', it is mentioned that removing phase-shifted information with a focal spot filter plus removal of all phase-shifted frequencies can improve image quality. In 'Image enhancement by digital-analog filtration', the function of a device for frequency filtration of roentgenograms with digital filters has been tested, and the results indicate that improvement should be achieved by low-pass filtration. This suggests that the goal of filtration is to selectively remove certain wavelengths or frequencies from the radiation beam. Furthermore, 'Effect of x-ray filtration on dose and image performance of CT scanners' discusses the use of X-ray source filtration to reduce patient dose while maintaining image quality. The article presents a figure of merit for selecting filter materials with an optimal atomic number. In 'Diagnostic significance of high-filtration xeromammography', the additional filtration through 3 mm aluminium enables significant reduction of radiation dose in xeromammography, which further supports the idea that filtration is used to remove certain wavelengths or frequencies from the radiation beam. Based on this analysis, the function of filtration process while taking radiographs is likely to be related to removing specific components from the radiation beam.\",\n\"answer_choice\": A\n}"]
