["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents provide information on the mechanical properties of connective tissue, its behavior under loading and immobilization, and its role in various physiological processes. There is no specific data provided on the width of connective tissue around an implant. However, we can look at studies that describe the mechanical strength and hydroxyproline content of connective tissue in porous ceramic implants. According to one study, a correlation was found between the mechanical strength and the hydroxyproline content of connective tissue in the implants. This suggests that the width of connective tissue around an implant could be related to its mechanical properties and chemical composition.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
