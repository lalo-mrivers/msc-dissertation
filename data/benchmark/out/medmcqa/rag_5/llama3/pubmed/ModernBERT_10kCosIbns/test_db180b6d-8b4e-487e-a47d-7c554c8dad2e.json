["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking which of the given options show chemical bond with enamel (calcified tissues). The relevant documents provide information about the characteristics of proteins in tooth enamel. According to the document '[Characteristics of the proteins of tooth enamel]', it is mentioned that mineralization of the protein appears to occur due to development of bonds between Ca2+ and some amino acid residues. This suggests that there is a chemical bond between calcium ions and certain amino acid residues in the enamel proteins. Among the given options, only one mentions calcium ions: 'Polycarboxylate cements'. These cements contain polycarboxylic acids which can form complexes with calcium ions. Therefore, it is likely that Polycarboxylate cements show chemical bond with enamel (calcified tissues).\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
