["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about a patient who reports severe throbbing pain in relation to the mandibular second molar. The tooth is sensitive to both hot and cold food and elicits a painful response on percussion. Based on this information, I think the pulp or dentine of the tooth might be affected, but the description does not suggest any pulp disease. Therefore, I will consider the possibility that the pain could be due to physical factors affecting the enamel and dentine rather than pulp disease. The text suggests that when pain occurs in teeth as a result of external stimulation it is more likely to be due to physical factors affecting the enamel and dentine than to pulp disease. Given this information, I think the treatment of choice would be related to treating the enamel and dentine.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
