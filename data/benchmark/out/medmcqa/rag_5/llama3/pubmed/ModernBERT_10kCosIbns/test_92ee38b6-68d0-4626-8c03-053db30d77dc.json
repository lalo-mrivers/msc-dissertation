["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about sudden death in a patient with an acute myocardial infarction. We have to analyze the given documents. Sudden death is most usual in the last trimester during the 6-year follow-up period (document 1). In document 2, risk factors associated with late in-hospital sudden death include certain arrhythmias and conduction disturbances. Document 3 reports that possibilities to predict sudden death were small, although a definite dominance of this mode of death was noted in patients below 60 years of age. Document 4 describes the 5-year pattern of mortality among initial survivors of acute myocardial infarction using a life-table technique. The risk of death was highest during the early part of the follow-up. Special attention was paid to the incidence of sudden death, a fictive elimination of which was shown to reduce the risk of death by 9-22% during the different years of the investigation period.\n\nThe documents suggest that arrhythmias and conduction disturbances are risk factors for sudden death in patients with acute myocardial infarction. The type of arrhythmia is ventricular fibrillation.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
