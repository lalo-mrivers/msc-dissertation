["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the outer membrane of peripheral nerve. From the provided documents, we know that the molecular mechanisms involved in the generation and conduction of nerve impulses are still matters for conjecture. However, we can look at the chemical composition of the axolemma and how this compares with other membranes. The document on 'Chemical anatomy of the nerve membrane' states that modern spectroscopic techniques allow the measurement of non-electrical dynamic changes that occur during nerve conduction. These indicate that the chemical components of nerve membrane are in a very fluid state. This suggests that the outer membrane is permeable to ions.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B: Relative permeable to potassium ions\"\n}"]
