["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"There is no direct mention of Golgi tendon organs in the provided documents. However, we can infer that Golgi tendon organs are related to tendons based on their name. Golgi tendon organs are small receptors found within muscle-tendon units that detect changes in muscle length and tension. They provide information about the force and velocity of muscle contractions. In the context of the documents, which discuss tendon transfer, passive lengthening, active shortening, and electrical stimulation of tendons, it is reasonable to assume that Golgi tendon organs would be involved in detecting dynamic changes in muscle-tendon units.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: All\""]
