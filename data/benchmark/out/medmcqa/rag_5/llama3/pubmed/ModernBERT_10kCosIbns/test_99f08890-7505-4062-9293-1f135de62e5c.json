["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 16-year-old male who complains of nasal obstruction and recurrent epistaxis. The lesion is seen on CT scan of the nose and paranasal sinuses with minimal extension into the sphenoid sinus and no lateral extension. This suggests that the lesion is confined to or originating in the nasopharynx, which is consistent with antral lesions making up 67% in the study 'Malignant neoplasms of the nasal cavities and paranasal sinuses: (a retrospective study)'.\n\nGiven that the lesion has minimal extension into the sphenoid sinus but no lateral extension, it suggests a stage I lesion. The most common tumor type involved was epidermoid, which is also consistent with the patient's age. However, since the question does not specify whether the lesion is benign or malignant, we will consider both possibilities.\n\nThe 'Malignant neoplasms of the nasal cavities and paranasal sinuses: (a retrospective study)' study suggests that staging according to Sisson's TNM classification would be applicable to antral lesions. Therefore, considering a stage I lesion with minimal extension into the sphenoid sinus but no lateral extension, the most likely stage is IB.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
