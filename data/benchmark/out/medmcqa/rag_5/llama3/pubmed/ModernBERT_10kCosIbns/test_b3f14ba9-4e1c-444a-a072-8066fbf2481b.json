["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks which cells are most increased in number in the connective tissue wall of a periodontal pocket. From the provided documents, we can see that the document 'Cell populations and episodic periodontal attachment loss in humans' discusses cell populations in the supracrestal connective tissue in humans. This study found that in sites with periodontal disease progression (P-sites), there were significantly higher numbers of macrophages, plasma cells, mast cells, lymphocytes and total inflammatory cells compared to control sites (C-sites). Therefore, we can conclude that plasma cells are most increased in number in the connective tissue wall of a periodontal pocket.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
