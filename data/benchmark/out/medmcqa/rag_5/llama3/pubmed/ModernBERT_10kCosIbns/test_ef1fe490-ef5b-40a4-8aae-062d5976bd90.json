["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The problem is to find the range for a 90% confidence interval of the average GFR (glomerular filtration rate) which is given as 85 ml/min with a standard deviation of 25. To solve this, we need to use the formula for calculating the confidence interval of a mean. The formula is: CI = x̄ ± t * σ / √n, where x̄ is the sample mean (85), σ is the standard deviation (25), and n is the sample size (100). We need to find the critical value t from the t-distribution table with a confidence level of 90% and degrees of freedom equal to n-1. Once we have the critical value, we can calculate the upper and lower limits of the CI.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A: 81-89\""]
