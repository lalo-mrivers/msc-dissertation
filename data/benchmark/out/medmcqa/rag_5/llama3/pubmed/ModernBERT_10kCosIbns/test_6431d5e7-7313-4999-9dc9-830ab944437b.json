["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the possibility of avascular necrosis at the distal pole of scaphoid after a fracture. The given reason is that blood supply of scaphoid is from distal to proximal, which implies that the distal pole would receive less blood flow and thus be more prone to necrosis. This makes sense based on the anatomy of the scaphoid bone. Avascular necrosis occurs when there is inadequate blood supply to a specific area, leading to tissue death. In this case, if the blood supply is primarily from the proximal end, it's possible that the distal pole could be at risk for avascular necrosis after a fracture.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B: Both asseion and reason are true and reason explains asseion\""]
