["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The study on 'Thumbsucking and falling asleep' states that thumbsucking is aetiologically more related to ways of falling asleep than to other factors. This suggests that thumbsucking can occur during sleep or when the child is likely to fall asleep, which in this case would be up to 4 years old. The study on 'Sucking habits and occlusion' mentions that sucking habits are observed up to the age of 3 years.
