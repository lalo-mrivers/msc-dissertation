["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the first nerve fiber present in the vicinity of dental papilla. We can look at the documents to find when nerve growth factor (NGF) plays a role in development of intradental innervation. According to 'Immunoassay evidence for a role of nerve growth factor in development of dental innervation', NGF is detected and measured in pulps of developing rat molars before and during the time of innervation development. This suggests that NGF is involved in early stages of tooth development, including the formation of the dental papilla. Additionally, 'Morphogenic interactions between tooth components' mentions that young pulps controlled the three-dimensional structure of tooth germs, indicating that the pulp is involved in early tooth development. Therefore, it's likely that the first nerve fiber present in the vicinity of dental papilla appears during the early stages of tooth development.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
