["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about dietary goals for avoiding Coronary Artery Disease. Based on the provided documents, we can look at the Scottish Heart Health Study which suggests that a relatively low energy intake, high percentage of energy from protein and moderate percentage of energy from alcohol are favourable factors with respect to CHD risk. We can also consider the Relation between diet composition and coronary heart disease risk factors which found a positive association between some nutrient components (energy, alcohol, total and saturated fats) and some blood lipids.\n\nThe Diet and coronary heart disease document states that epidemiological and other evidence suggests that for the primary and secondary dietary prevention of CHD, intake of fat (also cholesterol) should be reduced, with an increase in the polyunsaturated moiety, and obesity should be controlled. This implies that reducing overall fat intake could be a goal.\n\nFinally, we can look at the Diet and coronary heart disease document again which states that controversies over interpretations of evidence, over dietary recommendations, and also over the changes of their adoption, are discussed. Therefore, based on these findings, we can conclude that a low energy intake, high percentage of energy from protein, moderate percentage of energy from alcohol and reduction in fat intake could be some dietary goals for avoiding Coronary Artery Disease.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
