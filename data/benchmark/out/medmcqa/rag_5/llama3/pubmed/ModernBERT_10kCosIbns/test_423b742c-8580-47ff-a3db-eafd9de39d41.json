The document 'Abdominal pain in children' states that most disease states can be ruled out by a careful history, physical examination, and simple laboratory tests. If organic disease is present, there are often clues in the history and examination. The kidney is often the culprit, and an intravenous pyelogram should be done if disease is suspected. Barium enema is the next most valuable test. Duodenal ulcers and abdominal epilepsy are rare and over-diagnosed.\n\nGiven that stool microscopy was performed, which showed some findings, we can assume that the child's symptoms are related to a gastrointestinal issue.
