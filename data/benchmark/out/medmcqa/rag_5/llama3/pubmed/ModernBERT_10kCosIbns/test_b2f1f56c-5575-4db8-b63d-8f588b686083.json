["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents provided discuss various methods for assessing age-standardized weight-for-height in children. The first document presents a ratio of age-standardized weight to the square of age-standardized height as an index of weight-for-height. The second and third documents discuss the importance of parental height in estimating child growth, with no direct correlation between child height and weight mentioned. The fourth document introduces a new index for assessing weight change in children, using a ratio of actual weight to normed weight/height ratios. This suggests that the correlation between height and weight may not be straightforward, but rather involves normalization for age or other factors.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
