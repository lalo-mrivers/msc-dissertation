["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents discuss the transit pool of iron, which is a low molecular weight complex that can be chelated by agents like desferrioxamine. Iron may enter this pool from transferrin or as a result of endogenous haem breakdown and mobilization of ferritin iron. Ferritin accounts for only 5-10% of mucosal iron, and most of the mucosal radioactivity occurs in cell sap, about equally distributed between ferritin and low-molecular-weight chelated iron. This suggests that iron may be transported as a chelate with which ferritin is in rapid equilibrium. Therefore, iron entry into enterocytes likely involves the transport of this chelate.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
