["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the placement of a graft that will be failure. I see that the documents discuss various types of grafts, including skin grafts, but none of them directly address the classification of recession. However, one document mentions 'gingival coverage of denuded root surfaces' which seems relevant. Upon reviewing this document, I notice that it discusses four surgical procedures for providing coverage of denuded root surfaces resulting from gingival recession. This makes me think that the question is actually asking about a specific type of recession, namely gingival recession. The other documents do not seem to be directly applicable to this scenario. Therefore, I will focus on the classification of skin grafts by coverage of the receptor area, which seems to be related.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
