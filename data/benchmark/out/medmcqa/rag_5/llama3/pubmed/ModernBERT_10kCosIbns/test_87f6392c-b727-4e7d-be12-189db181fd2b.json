["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents provide information on DNA sequencing methods and the composition of human DNA. The first document describes a method for sequencing DNA by breaking a terminally labeled DNA molecule partially at each repetition of a base. This allows for the identification of the positions of that base. The technique can sequence at least 100 bases from the point of labeling. The second document discusses intramolecular base composition heterogeneity in human DNA, stating that sequences shorter than 2000 base pairs are heterogeneous and occupy around 67-81% of the genome. The third document highlights compositional variations in DNA sequences and describes general patterns found in prokaryotic and eukaryotic DNA. Finally, the fourth document details a method for analyzing the human genome using complementary RNA/DNA hybridization and relaxes cesium sulfate-silver ion density centrifugation. These methods reveal that the bulk of the human genome is made up of ten density-biased components containing sequences of varying degrees of repetitiveness.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
