["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents mention a study on the circulation of toxigenic and nontoxigenic diphtheria bacilli under conditions of a natural course of the epidemic process. It is stated that no formation of the toxigenic variants of diphtheria bacillus as a result of phage conversion was revealed in the foci of carrier state despite the wide spread in them of nontoxigenic lysosensitive cultures capable of acquiring the toxigenic properties under experimental conditions, and of the cultures which had converting corinephages. This suggests that phage mediated change is not responsible for the conversion.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
