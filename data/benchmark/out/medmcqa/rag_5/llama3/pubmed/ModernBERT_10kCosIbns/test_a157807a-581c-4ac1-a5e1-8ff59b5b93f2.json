["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"After reviewing the provided documents, I found that 'centric interference' is not explicitly mentioned. However, one of the documents mentions 'degradation of the NMR signal by noise and coherent RF interference', which suggests that centric interference might be related to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). Since MRI/MRI systems are discussed in the document 'Interference problems and screening in NMR and MRI', I will focus on this context. In MRI, 'centric' likely refers to the central part of the image, where signals are strongest. To remove centric interference, we need to reduce noise or artifacts that affect the central region. Based on my analysis, I believe that reducing 'Central fossa' would be relevant in this context.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
