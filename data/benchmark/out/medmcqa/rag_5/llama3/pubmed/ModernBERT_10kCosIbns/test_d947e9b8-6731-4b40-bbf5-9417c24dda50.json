["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the mechanical transduction in the Golgi tendon organ (GTO) as a mechanism that allows it to function as a biological force transducer under static loading conditions. The GTO is sensitive to changes in muscle tension, and its unmyelinated terminal branches are trapped between collagen braids within the spaces of the muscle's tendon. When force is applied to the muscle's tendon, these collagen braids straighten and cause compressional deformation of the axon branches, which may contribute to the detection of muscle tension.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
