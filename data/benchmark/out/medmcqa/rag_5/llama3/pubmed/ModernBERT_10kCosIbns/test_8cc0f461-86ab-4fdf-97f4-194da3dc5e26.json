["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The location of Meissner's corpuscles can be determined by reviewing the relevant documents. In 'Development of Meissner corpuscle of mouse toe pad', it is mentioned that Meissner corpuscles are located in the epidermis, and Schwann cells invade the epidermis further, extending many cytoplasmic processes which are intimately associated with basal cells of epidermis. This suggests that Meissner's corpuscles are embedded within the epidermal layer. In 'Unmyelinated nerve fibers associated with Meissner's corpuscle in the green monkey', it is mentioned that the thin unmyelinated fibers lead in the vicinity of Meissner's corpuscles in the connective tissue of its sheaths, between the epidermis and the peripheral fibroblast layer. This further supports the notion that Meissner's corpuscles are located within the epidermal layer.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
