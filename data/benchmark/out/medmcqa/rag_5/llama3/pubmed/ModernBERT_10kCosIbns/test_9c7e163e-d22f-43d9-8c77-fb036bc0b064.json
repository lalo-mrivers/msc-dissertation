["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient had a recent myocardial infarction, so the focus is on preventing further cardiovascular events. The lipid profile shows elevated LDL (126 mg/dL) and triglycerides (276 mg/dL), while HDL levels are relatively low at 32 mg/dL. Based on this information, we can infer that the patient likely has combined hyperlipidaemia with increased VLDL and LDL triglycerides.\n\nGiven the presence of LDL-related abnormalities, a statin such as Rosuvastatin or Atorvastatin would be a suitable choice to target LDL levels. However, given the elevated triglyceride levels, an additional fibrates-based treatment may be necessary to address this issue.\n\nConsidering the patient's age (60 years) and recent myocardial infarction, we should prioritize reducing cardiovascular risk factors by targeting both LDL and triglycerides.\n\nTherefore, a combination therapy approach with Rosuvastatin and Fenofibrate would be the most appropriate option for this patient.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A: Rosuvastatin + Fenofibrate\""]
