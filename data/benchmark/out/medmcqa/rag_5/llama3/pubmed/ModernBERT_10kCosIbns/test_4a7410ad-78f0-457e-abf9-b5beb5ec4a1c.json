["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the provided documents, it can be inferred that apical periodontitis is a complex disease process. Chronic adult periodontitis is characterized by the presence of apical border plaque, which is composed of various bacterial morphotypes. The paper on 'The Apical Border Plaque in Chronic Adult Periodontitis' suggests that there is a limited range of intact bacterial morphotypes in the apical border plaque.\n\nThe document 'Clinical Criteria for the Definition of \"Established Periodontitis\"' defines established periodontitis as a condition characterized by clinical attachment loss. This implies that apical periodontitis is a sequel to pulpal diseases or other factors that cause inflammation and tissue damage at the apex of the tooth.\n\nAdditionally, the paper on 'Alveolar Bone Remodeling in the Early Stage of Experimental Apical Periodontitis' suggests that apical periodontitis is characterized by active bone remodeling, including both resorption and formation. This further supports the idea that apical periodontitis is a complex disease process with multiple factors contributing to its development.\n\nBased on this analysis, it can be concluded that apical periodontitis is primarily caused by a sequel of pulpal diseases or other inflammatory stimuli.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
