["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to the provided documents, dentin is composed of non-collagenous proteins, including a phosphoprotein rich in aspartic acid and phosphoserine. This protein occurs in soluble and insoluble forms, with the latter being associated with the collagenous matrix. There is no direct information about the proportion of inorganic components in dentin. However, we can look at The seeded growth of calcium phosphates on dentin and predentin, which mentions that the mineralization of OD (organic component of dentin) has a stoichiometry close to that for octacalcium phosphate. This suggests that there may be some inorganic components present in dentin.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C: 50% inorganic\""]
