["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents describe the anatomy of the extensor apparatus of the fingers. The dorsal aponeurosis is composed of three types of reactions: gliding on the sides of the pyramid (proximal epiphyses of the phalanges), displacement of axes of insertion and rotation, and modifications of structures of transmission. This information suggests that the interosseous muscles play a role in finger extension. The document 'Movement patterns of interosseus-minus fingers' further supports this by showing that the pattern of isolated metacarpophalangeal flexion and interphalangeal extension movements is different in fingers with intact extrinsic and lumbrical muscles but no interossei (interosseus-minus fingers). This implies that the dorsal interossei are involved in finger extension.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
