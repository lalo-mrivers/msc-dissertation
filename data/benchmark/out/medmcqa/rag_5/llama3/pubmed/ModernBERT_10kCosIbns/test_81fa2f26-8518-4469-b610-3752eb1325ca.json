["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the properties of cobalt chromium alloys during high-frequency induction soldering. The given documents describe various aspects of cobalt-chromium alloys, including their mechanical strength and resistance to crevice corrosion. One document discusses the development of a new investment for high-frequency induction soldering, which involves heating to 900Â°C. This suggests that high temperatures are involved in the process. Therefore, we need to look at how temperature affects the properties of cobalt chromium alloys.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
