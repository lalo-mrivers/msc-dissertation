["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for statements about acute leukemia in children that are true except one. Upon reviewing the provided documents, I see that they mostly discuss the treatment and prognosis of acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL) in children. There is no mention of gross gingival swelling, mucosal pallor, or purpura as symptoms of ALL. Therefore, it is likely that option A, B, or C is the correct answer. However, since the documents do provide information about the characteristics and outcomes of childhood ALL, I will review the statements again to eliminate any options that might be true based on the provided data. Upon reviewing the documents once more, I see that they do mention that certain factors can affect the prognosis of childhood ALL, including age, initial white blood cell count, and type of leukemia. This makes me think that option D, which states that acute leukemia in children is usually of the lymphoblastic variety, might be a true statement based on the provided data. Therefore, I will eliminate option D as the correct answer.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
