["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the deficiency of an enzyme that prevents vitamin C from being synthesized in humans. Upon reviewing the provided documents, I found that vitamin C is essential for human health and its deficiency can lead to scurvy. However, there is no information in these documents regarding the specific enzymes involved in vitamin C synthesis or deficiency. Therefore, I will rely on general knowledge of biochemistry to answer this question. Vitamin C (ascorbic acid) is synthesized from glucose-6-phosphate via a series of enzyme-catalyzed reactions in humans. The first committed step in this pathway is the conversion of D-glucose 6-phosphate into L-gulonolactone, which is catalyzed by the enzyme L-gulonolactone oxidase. Further down the pathway, L-gulonic acid reductase converts L-gulono-1,4-lactone to L-xylulose.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
