["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents suggest that the most commonly missing teeth are molars. In 'A study of occlusal anomalies and tooth loss in children aged 13-15 years in Nairobi', it is mentioned that almost all the teeth lost as a result of caries were molars, while those due to orthodontic indications were premolars. Similarly, in 'Effect of luxation injuries on permanent teeth', it is stated that 28% of the total material had loss of pulp vitality and external root resorptions, which could also be indicative of molar tooth loss. In 'Premature loss of primary teeth: part I, its overall effect on occlusion and space in the permanent dentition', it is mentioned that premature loss of primary molars causes changes in regard to space and sagittal molar relations in the permanent dentition. Therefore, based on this information, we can infer that molars are likely to be missing teeth.\", \"answer_choice\": A}"]
