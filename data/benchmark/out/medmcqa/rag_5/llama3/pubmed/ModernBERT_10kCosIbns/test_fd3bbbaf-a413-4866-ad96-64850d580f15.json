["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking which option is NOT resorbable Guided Tissue Regeneration (GTR). From the provided documents, we can infer that GTR refers to the use of certain materials or methods to regenerate tissue. The documents do not specifically mention PTFE (option D) as being related to GTR. Poly lactic acid, polygalactic acid, and trimethylene carbonate are all mentioned as types of materials used in regeneration procedures (Regeneration procedures: grafting materials, guided tissue regeneration, and growth factors). Therefore, option D, PTFE, is the correct answer.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
