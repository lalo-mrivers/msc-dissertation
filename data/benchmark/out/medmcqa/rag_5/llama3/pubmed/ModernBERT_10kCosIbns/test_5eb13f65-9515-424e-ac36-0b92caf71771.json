["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about SCC (Squamous Cell Carcinoma) present on the lateral margin of the tongue, staging T2N0. The key information here is that there are no lymph nodes involved (N0). Therefore, we need to focus on the options related to surgery and its extent. The question does not specifically mention any other treatment modalities like radiation or chemotherapy. From the given documents, it seems that the documents only provide information about the tongue itself, its atherosclerosis, histopathological changes, cancer, modification in treatment of prognathism, and neurinoma. There is no specific information about lymph node removal. Based on this, we can conclude that lymph node dissection is not directly related to the provided documents.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
