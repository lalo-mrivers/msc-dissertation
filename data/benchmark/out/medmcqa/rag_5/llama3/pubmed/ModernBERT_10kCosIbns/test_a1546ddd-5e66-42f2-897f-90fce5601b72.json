["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about an inborn error of metabolism associated with mental retardation. We need to analyze the provided documents for any information related to mental retardation. The document 'Effects of intrauterine growth retardation and its subtypes on the development of the preterm infant' mentions that there were more children with low social abilities scores in the A-SGA group than in the control group, indicating a possibility of slow neurological development. This is not directly related to mental retardation, but it may be relevant. The document 'Neurologic sequelae in infants with intrauterine growth retardation' reviews the literature on neurologic sequelae in infants with IUGR and mentions that certain premature infants who are appropriately grown for gestational age (AGA) but whose birth weights fall below the 50th percentile may have IUGR. This does not provide direct information about mental retardation either. The document '[A peculiar syndrome of congenital abnormalities]' describes a specific syndrome due to a genetic defect inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion, which involves mental retardation. Based on this information, we can eliminate options A and C as they do not mention mental retardation. Options B and D both involve galactosemia, which is associated with mental retardation.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
