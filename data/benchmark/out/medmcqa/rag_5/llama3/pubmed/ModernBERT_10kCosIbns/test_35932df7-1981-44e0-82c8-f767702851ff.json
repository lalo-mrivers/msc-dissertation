["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about common signs of occlusal trauma (TFO). After reviewing the provided documents, I see that one of them discusses the effects of occlusal instability. It mentions that changes can be either horizontal or vertical, and that horizontal changes may not be damaging while vertical changes require a more extensive treatment procedure. This suggests that TFO is related to changes in the occlusion rather than specific anatomical structures.\n\nThe other documents discuss craniofacial injuries, temporomandibular articulation dysfunction, and maxillofacial trauma assessment and treatment. While these topics are relevant to oral health, they do not provide direct information about common signs of TFO.\n\nGiven this analysis, I will look for answers that relate to changes in the occlusion or dental structures. Options A, B, and C all refer to dental or alveolar (bone) structures, while option D refers to a ligamentous structure. Based on this reasoning, I think the correct answer is one of the options related to dental or alveolar structures.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
