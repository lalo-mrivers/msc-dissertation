["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Since the documents provided do not mention ampulas or their disposal, I will analyze the context of each document to see if there is a hint about where broken ampula would be thrown. The first document talks about retrieving materials from laundry chutes and does not mention medical waste. The second and third documents discuss surgical procedures and blood transfusion filters. There is no mention of pharmaceutical waste disposal or ampulas. The fourth document studies wastage of pharmaceuticals, but it only suggests ways to reduce drug waste through blister-packing and conservative prescribing. Therefore, there is no direct connection between the question about broken ampula and any information provided in the documents.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
