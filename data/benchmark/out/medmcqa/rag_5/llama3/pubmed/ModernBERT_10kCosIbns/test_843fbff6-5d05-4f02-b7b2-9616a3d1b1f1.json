["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents discuss thermoregulation, heat exchange, and body temperature regulation. The 'Responses to the thermal environment' document states that human responses serve to maintain a narrow range of internal body temperatures of 36-38 C. Thermoregulatory responses are proportional to changes in internal and mean skin temperatures. This suggests that the control of body temperature is not solely dependent on behavioral or physiological responses, but rather on a central regulating mechanism. The 'Thermoregulatory responses as a function of core temperature in humans' document specifically highlights the role of the hypothalamus in controlling body temperature, stating that heat production, sweating, and vasomotor response were proportional to core temperature. Therefore, it can be concluded that the hypothalamus plays a crucial role in regulating body temperature.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
