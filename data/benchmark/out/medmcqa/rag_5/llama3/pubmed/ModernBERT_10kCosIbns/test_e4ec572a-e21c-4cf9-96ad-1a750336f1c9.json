["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents provided do not mention the half-life of TGF-beta. However, we can look for information on the activation or degradation of TGF-beta. According to one of the documents, 'Activation of these receptors leads to inhibition of epithelial cell proliferation by a mechanism that may involve proteins related to the growth suppressor, RB.' This implies that once activated, TGF-beta is involved in cellular processes and does not mention its half-life. Another document states, 'The various TGF-beta isoforms are highly conserved and display a complex pattern of interactions with multiple membrane receptor components.' Again, no information on half-life is provided. Therefore, we cannot determine the half-life of TGF-beta based on these documents.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C\n}"]
