["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents mention the curing of methyl methacrylate and composite resins with benzoyl peroxide. The document 'Polymerizable amines as promoters of cold-curing resins and composites' mentions that the accelerating activity of N,N-substituted aminoethyl methacrylates on the curing of methyl methacrylate and composite resins with benzoyl peroxide is somewhat smaller than that of dimethyl-p-toluidine. This implies that benzoyl peroxide plays a role in initiating polymerization, but does not specify a temperature.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
