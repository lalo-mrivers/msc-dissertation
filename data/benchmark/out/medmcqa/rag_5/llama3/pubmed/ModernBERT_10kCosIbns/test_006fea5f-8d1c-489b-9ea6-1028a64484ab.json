["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about Fingerprinting (FINDER) which involves recording prints of 8 fingers. The options provided are Ring finger, Thumb, Little finger, and Middle finger. We can eliminate the thumb as it is not a finger pair. Among the remaining options, we can also eliminate the little finger because it is a single finger, not a finger pair. This leaves us with the Ring finger and Middle finger. However, both of these are individual fingers, not pairs. Therefore, the only option that remains is C: Little finger, which is excluded as it's a single finger.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
