["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"After reviewing the relevant documents, we can see that periodontal destruction was produced by a combination of inflammatory and traumatic factors. Alveolar bone regeneration took place after the inflammation was resolved and trauma stopped. We also have information about the remains of periodontal membrane found in the apical area of the alveoli. This information leads us to think about the role of periodontal membrane in the beginning process of alveolar wound healing.\n\nWe can also look at histometric study of the effect of occlusal alteration on periodontal tissue healing after surgical injury. The study reveals a significant narrowing of the periodontal ligament width and significant thickening of cementum at and above the surgical cavity site.\n\nFinally, we have information about the phylogeny of teeth and the different types of periodontal attachment that have been developed over time. This information helps us understand the principal structures of cementum, fiber apparatus, and junctional epithelium that are decisive for reaction patterns of degeneration and regeneration.\n\nWith this information in mind, we can think about which periodontal fibers are consistent and reconstructed even after the destruction of the alveolar bone. We have information about the remains of periodontal membrane found in the apical area of the alveoli, which suggests that the apical fibers may be consistent and reconstructed.\n\nTherefore, based on our step-by-step thinking, we can conclude that the answer is A: Apical.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
