["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 6-month-old boy with recurrent vomiting and polyuria. The blood tests show normal renal function (creatinine 0.7 mg/dL) but elevated PTH level (140 pg/ml). Daily urinary calcium excretion is reduced, suggesting that the kidneys are able to eliminate excess calcium. The ultrasound abdomen shows bilateral nephrocalcinosis. Given these findings, it seems unlikely that the patient has a disorder characterized by hypercalcemia or hyperphosphatemia. Ps eudoâ€“ps eudohypoparathyroidism is also unlikely due to the normal blood phosphate level. Bartter syndrome could be a possibility, but the absence of polyuria and hypokalemia makes it less likely. The most plausible diagnosis is therefore a mutation of the calcium sensing receptor.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
