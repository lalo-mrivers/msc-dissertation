["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe oral reactions to mouthwashes, but they don't specifically discuss the cause of dryness of mouth after brushing. One document does mention an investigation into the possible irritant effects on oral soft tissue under stringent test conditions, which doesn't suggest that any ingredient is causing dryness. Another study examines the effect of timed hygienic measures on oral mucosa in a group of elderly subjects and doesn't provide information about dry mouth after brushing. A third study compares the effect of pre-brushing mouthwash (Plax) with placebo and finds no significant difference in oral hygiene. Finally, a fourth document discusses various commercial mouthwashes but doesn't specifically address dryness of mouth after brushing. Based on this analysis, we can conclude that none of the ingredients mentioned in the options cause dryness of mouth after brushing.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
