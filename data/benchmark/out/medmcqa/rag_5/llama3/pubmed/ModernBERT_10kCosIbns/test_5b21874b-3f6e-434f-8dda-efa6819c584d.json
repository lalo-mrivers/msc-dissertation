["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the effects of excessive forces of occlusion within physiological limits on the periodontal ligament (PDL). The document 'Variations in organic occlusion' describes principles of organic occlusion and variations such as distoclusion and mesioclusion, but does not specifically mention PDL. However, it does describe potential areas of conflict in these variations and methods for correction. This suggests that the forces of occlusion can affect the PDL.\n\nThe document 'Measurement of maximal expiratory pressure' discusses the importance of proper compression of lips and corners of the mouth during measurements, which could potentially relate to excessive forces of occlusion within physiological limits.\n\nThe document 'Intra-articular pressure measurements in patients with suddenly developing, severely limited mouth opening' describes a condition where persistent pressure (e.g. clenching) can cause the viscoelastic disc to be pressed flat against the fossa, resulting in increased negative pressure in the closed space created.\n\nThe document 'The effect of hyperoxia, hypoxia and hypercapnia on FRC and occlusion pressure' discusses changes in FRC (functional residual capacity) during different breathing conditions, which could relate to changes in PDL width or thickness. However, it does not specifically discuss the effects of excessive forces of occlusion within physiological limits.\n\nBased on these documents, I believe that excessive forces of occlusion within physiological limit will: \",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
