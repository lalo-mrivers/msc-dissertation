["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Upon reviewing the provided documents, I noticed that none of them explicitly mention Bandura, Joseph Wolpe, Addleston, or Wright. However, since one of the papers discusses 'systematic desensitization', which is a well-known technique developed by Joseph Wolpe, I can infer that the correct answer is related to Wolpe.
