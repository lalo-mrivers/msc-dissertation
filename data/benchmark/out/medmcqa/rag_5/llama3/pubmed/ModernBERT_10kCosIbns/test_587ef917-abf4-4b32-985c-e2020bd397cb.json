["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about anaerobic glycolysis. The provided documents are related to glycolytic systems, flux control, and response coefficients. Since the question doesn't explicitly mention a specific system or condition, we can focus on general principles of anaerobic glycolysis. Anaerobic glycolysis occurs in the absence of oxygen and primarily produces ATP, NADH, and pyruvate. The rate-limiting step is often phosphofructokinase (PFK). Glucokinase plays a role in regulating glucose flux.\n\nThe provided documents don't directly mention ATP production per unit glucose consumed for specific sugars like amino acid, fructose, galactose, or glycogen. However, they do discuss the glycolytic pathway and its regulation. Anaerobic glycolysis typically involves glycolysis of glucose (not the other options) to produce ATP, NADH, and pyruvate.\n\nThe relevant information is found in the second document, which discusses control analysis of rat liver glycolysis under different glucose concentrations. The flux variation under different glucose concentrations is mentioned. This implies that the focus is on glucose as the substrate for glycolysis, not amino acid, fructose, galactose, or glycogen.\n\nGiven this information, we can conclude that anaerobic glycolysis of glucose produces 3 ATPs per unit glucose consumed.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B: Fructose\""]
