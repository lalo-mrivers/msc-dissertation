["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about a male child with Fanconi syndrome with nephrocalcinosis. Dent disease is a disorder characterized by defects in the CLCN5 gene. Since the child has Fanconi syndrome and nephrocalcinosis, it is likely that he also has dent disease. Reviewing the provided documents, we can find information about dent disease. In one of the documents, 'Dentine dysplasia with sclerotic bone and skeletal anomalies inherited as an autosomal dominant trait.' This suggests that the child's disorder may be inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. Additionally, Fanconi syndrome is a known cause of nephrocalcinosis and proteinuria. Therefore, it is likely that the child has proteinuria.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
