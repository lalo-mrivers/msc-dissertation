["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the type of plasmodium species that is commonly associated with relapse. We can look at the documents to see if there are any specific mentions or studies on this topic. The document 'Carbohydrate metabolism of malarial parasites' does not mention relapse specifically, but it does discuss the different pathways involved in carbohydrate metabolism. The document 'Studies on enzyme variation in the murine malaria parasites Plasmodium berghei, P. yoelii, P. vinckei and P. chabaudi by starch gel electrophoresis' does not provide any information relevant to this question.\n\nThe document 'Amino acid metabolism and protein synthesis in malarial parasites' discusses the different amino acid sources for parasite protein synthesis, but it does not mention relapse specifically.\n\nThe document '[Identification of plasmodial antibodies in the immunodiagnosis of malaria (author's transl)]' provides some information relevant to this question. It mentions that P. falciparum was a less sensitive antigen for the demonstration of plasmodial antibodies compared to P. fieldi, which suggests that there may be differences in the immune response to different Plasmodium species.\n\nBased on these findings, we can conclude that relapse is more common with certain types of Plasmodium species. Specifically, we can look at the document 'Studies on enzyme variation in the murine malaria parasites Plasmodium berghei, P. yoelii, P. vinckei and P. chabaudi by starch gel electrophoresis' to see if there are any studies on relapse in these species.\n\nThe document '[Identification of plasmodial antibodies in the immunodiagnosis of malaria (author's transl)]' suggests that P. falciparum may be less likely to cause relapse compared to other Plasmodium species, such as P. vivax and P. ovale.\",\n\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
