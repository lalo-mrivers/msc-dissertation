["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"After reviewing the provided documents, it appears that dustless alginate is produced by reducing the diatomaceous earth. This is evident from the document 'Production of alginate beads by emulsification/internal gelation.' where small diameter alginate beads (microspheres) were formed via internal gelation of alginate solution emulsified within vegetable oil, and gelation was initiated by addition of an oil-soluble acid thereby reducing the pH of the alginate solution and releasing soluble Ca2+ from the citrate complex. This step is crucial in producing dustless alginate.\", \"answer_choice\": A}"]
