["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the provided documents, we can see that plate osteosynthesis is a technique used for fractures of the edentulous or partially edentulous mandible. In cases of fractures in the anterior and premolar regions, the intra-oral approach should be given preference. There is no specific mention of loading the fracture mandible posterior to the site of fracture, but we can infer that it might be related to plate osteosynthesis.\n\nThe question mentions loading the fracture mandible posterior to the site of fracture, which suggests that we are looking for a possible reaction to this type of loading. Fractures of the mandible often require intermaxillary fixation and closed reduction. Closed reduction is a technique used to manipulate the fractured bone back into place without making any incisions.\n\nGiven these points, we can deduce that when the fracture mandible is loaded posterior to the site of fracture, compression on the medial surface (C) might be present.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
