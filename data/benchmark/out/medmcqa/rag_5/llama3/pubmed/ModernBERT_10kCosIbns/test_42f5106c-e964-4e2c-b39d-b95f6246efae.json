["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Upon reviewing the provided documents, I noticed that none of the techniques mentioned are RNA-based. However, based on the information about sequencing RNA, I can infer that techniques such as rapid print-readout and direct chemical method for sequencing RNA are primarily RNA-based. This eliminates options A, B, and C which are not directly related to RNA sequencing. Option D, Western blotting, is a protein detection technique and is not relevant to RNA-based methods.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
