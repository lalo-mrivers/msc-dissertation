["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about mechanical advantage to prevent proximal displacement of the restoration in a MO cavity prepared for an inlay. The answer can be found by analyzing the provided documents related to dentistry and implantology. Upon reviewing the documents, I did not find any direct reference to the creation of a dovetail or acute lingual inclination in the context of preparing a MO cavity for an inlay. Therefore, options C and D are unlikely to be correct. Option A is also not relevant as pulpal depth is not directly related to preventing proximal displacement. This leaves us with option B, parallel walls, which could provide mechanical advantage to prevent proximal displacement.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
