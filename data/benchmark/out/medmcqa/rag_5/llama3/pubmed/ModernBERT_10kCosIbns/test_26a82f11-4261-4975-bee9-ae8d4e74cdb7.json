["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks for the occurrence that happens whenever there is an imbalance between myocardial oxygen supply and demand. This concept is closely related to 'myocardial oxygen demand' which is described as the relationship between the inherent needs of the heart and the available oxygenated blood reaching the myocardial tissue. The system is controlled by two different mechanisms: coronary blood flow, regulated primarily by tissue oxygen tension, and the determinants of myocardial oxygen consumption, controlled more by the heart's mechanical performance than tissue oxygen tension. An imbalance in these two mechanisms could lead to an imbalance between supply and demand.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
