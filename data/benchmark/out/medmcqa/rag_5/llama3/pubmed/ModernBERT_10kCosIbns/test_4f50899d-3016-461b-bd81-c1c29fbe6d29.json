["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents discuss the role of psychiatrists as both medical specialists and general physicians. One document mentions that a comprehensive rotation in neurology is included in a psychiatric training program. This implies that psychiatrists are trained to work with patients who have physical health concerns, not just mental health concerns.
