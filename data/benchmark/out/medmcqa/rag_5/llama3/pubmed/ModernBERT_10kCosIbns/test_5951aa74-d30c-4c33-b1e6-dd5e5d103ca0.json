["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the maximum amount of phosphate. After reviewing the documents, we can see that phosphate plays a crucial role in intermediary metabolism and is closely related to ionized calcium. Additionally, an article on absorption of inorganic phosphate in the human small intestine shows that ileal rates of phosphate absorption were lower at any given intraluminal phosphate concentration than previously described jejunal rates. This suggests that phosphate is not stored or concentrated in a specific tissue.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
