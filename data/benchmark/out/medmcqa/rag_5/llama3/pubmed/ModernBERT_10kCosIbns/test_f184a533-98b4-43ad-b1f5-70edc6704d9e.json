["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents discuss the effects of various forces on the periodontal ligament. From the 'Effects of horizontal tooth loading on the circulation and width of the periodontal ligament--an experimental study on beagle dogs' document, we can see that long-term force application resulted in localized blood clotting, suggesting that heavy forces can cause damage to the circulatory system. This is supported by the 'Stresses induced by edgewise appliances in the periodontal ligament--a finite element study' document, which shows that high stresses can be induced in the periodontal ligament even with 'perfect' edgewise mechanics. Therefore, heavy forces on the periodontal ligament likely cause damage to the circulatory system.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
