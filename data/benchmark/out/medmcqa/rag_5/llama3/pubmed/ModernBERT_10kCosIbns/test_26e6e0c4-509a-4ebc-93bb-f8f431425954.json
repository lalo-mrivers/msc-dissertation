["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the cause of insulin resistance in liver disease. From the provided documents, we can see that liver cirrhosis is associated with insulin resistance. The document 'Mechanism of insulin resistance associated with liver cirrhosis' explains that liver cirrhosis impairs insulin sensitivity and maximum cellular glucose disposal. It also states that reduced glucose disposal is caused by defective glucose storage and that insulin resistance is independent of the etiology of liver cirrhosis. From this, we can infer that the cause of insulin resistance in liver disease is not due to decreased secretion of insulin (A) nor low 'C'peptide level (D). The document 'Carbohydrate metabolism in liver disease' mentions that hyperinsulinism and hypoinsulinism are found in liver disease, but this does not specifically address insulin resistance. However, the document 'Mechanism of insulin resistance associated with liver cirrhosis' provides insight into the mechanisms of insulin resistance in liver cirrhosis, which suggests that it is caused by defective glucose storage.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
