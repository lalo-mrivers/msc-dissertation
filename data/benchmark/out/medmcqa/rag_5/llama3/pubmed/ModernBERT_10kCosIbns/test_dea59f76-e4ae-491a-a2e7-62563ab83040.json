["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient underwent a tonsillectomy at 6 years old without complications. At the age of 12, he had preoperative screening for bleeding before an elective laparotomy and was found to have a prolonged partial thromboplastin time but normal prothrombin time. There is no family history of bleeding.\n\nThe question asks us to identify the likely diagnosis based on these findings. We can rule out Factor XII deficiency as it does not typically present with a prolonged partial thromboplastin time alone. Mild hemophilia A may cause a prolonged partial thromboplastin time, but there is no reported family history, making this less likely.\n\nAcquired Vitamin K deficiency could be the answer as it often presents with prolonged clotting times and may be caused by malabsorption or liver disease. Acquired liver disease is also possible but does not seem to fit perfectly with the described findings.\n\nTherefore, we can consider Acquired Vitamin K deficiency as the most likely diagnosis based on the given information.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
