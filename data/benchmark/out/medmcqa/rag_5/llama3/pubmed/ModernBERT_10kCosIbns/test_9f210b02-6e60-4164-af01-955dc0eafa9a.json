["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks what is true about dentinal tubules except. The provided options are A: Inner pulpal layer contains more dentinal tubules than outer dentin layer, B: The diameter of dentin tubules ranges from 5 to 7μm, C: The diameter of dentinal tubule is more at pulpal layer than outer layer, and D: The bonding is more difficult on the inner Layer of dentin compared to outer surface. To answer this question, we need to refer to the provided documents.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom 'The diameter and number of dentinal tubules in rat, cat, dog and monkey. A comparative scanning electron microscopic study', we can see that at the pulpal wall, the mean diameter ranged from 1.7 to 2.8μm, while in the middle part of the dentin, it was 1.0 to 1.3μm, and at the periphery, it was 0.6 to 0.9μm.\\r\\n\\r\\nOption B is incorrect because the diameter of dentinal tubules does not range from 5 to 7μm.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to 'The diameter and number of dentinal tubules in rat, cat, dog and monkey. A comparative scanning electron microscopic study', at the pulpal wall, the mean diameter was 1.7 to 2.8μm, while in the middle part of the dentin, it was 1.0 to 1.3μm.\\r\\n\\r\\nOption C is also incorrect because the diameter of dentinal tubules is less at the pulpal layer than at the outer layer.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom 'The sensory mechanism in human dentin as revealed by evaporation and mechanical removal of dentin', we can see that the bonding between dentin and pulp may be affected by the water content in the dentinal tubules. However, this does not relate to the inner or outer surface of the dentin.\\r\\n\\r\\nTherefore, option D is also incorrect because it is not related to the inner or outer layer of dentin.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe correct answer is B: The diameter of dentin tubules ranges from 5 to 7μm.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
