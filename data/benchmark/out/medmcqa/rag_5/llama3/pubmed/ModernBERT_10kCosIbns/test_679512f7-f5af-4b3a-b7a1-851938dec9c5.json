["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about preventing patients' cross-infection with sensors in digital radiography/RVG. The relevant documents mention image intensifiers and large image intensifier systems, which are part of digital radiography/RVG. None of the provided choices directly relate to sensor cross-infection prevention. However, one document mentions screen-film combinations and phototimers, which could potentially lead to contamination. Another document discusses patient exposure and kilovoltage requirements for image visibility on x-ray film. These documents do not provide direct answers to this question. The only possible connection is the last document discussing image information content and patient exposure. It does not mention sensor cross-infection either. Therefore, we can eliminate all choices as they are not related to the question.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"None of the above\""]
