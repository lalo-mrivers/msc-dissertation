["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the origin of the primary endoderm using intraspecific chimaeras. The study confirms that the primary endoderm cells are derived from the ICM. The embryonic endoderm (visceral endoderm) and the parietal endoderm have a common origin and develop from the primitive ectoderm of the egg cylinder. In another study, it was found that during gastrulation, embryonic ectoderm cells continuously recruit to the definitive endoderm and mesoderm. This suggests that endoderm is derived from both epiblast and hypoblast.\", \"answer_choice\": C}"]
