["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The document [Studies on the dental methacrylic resins (part 4). Flow properties and curing times of the pour methacrylic resins (author's transl)] explains that the viscosity of the pour resins increased with time elapsed due to physical phenomenon, i.e., dissolution of polymer into monomer. This is relevant to processing methyl methacrylate as it implies that the resin may not have fully cured before being removed from the flask. Therefore, porosity is likely to occur.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A: Throughout the denture\"\n}"]
