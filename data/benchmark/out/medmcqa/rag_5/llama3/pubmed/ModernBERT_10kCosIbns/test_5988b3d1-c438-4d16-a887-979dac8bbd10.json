["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant document for this question is the 'Computed Tomographic study of the distances between the maxillary sinus floor and the apices of the maxillary posterior teeth' which provides information on the position of the roots of maxillary molars. Specifically, it states that the apex of the mesiobuccal root of the maxillary second molar was closest to the sinus floor (mean 1.97 mm) but farthest from the buccal bony surface (mean 4.45 mm). This suggests that the shortest root is not the distobuccal or palatal roots, as they are farther away from the sinus floor. Therefore, the only option left is the mesiobuccal root.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
