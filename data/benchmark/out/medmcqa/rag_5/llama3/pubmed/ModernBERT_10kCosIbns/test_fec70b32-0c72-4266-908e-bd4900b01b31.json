["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about features of a condition that involves abnormal resorption pattern in primary teeth. This is not mentioned in the provided documents, so we need to look for clues on what might be related to tooth loss or resorption. We see that root resorption is mentioned as a type of resorption that can affect teeth. Additionally, trauma is mentioned as a potential factor associated with resorption. We also see that tooth loss due to caries is a common reason in the study about occlusal anomalies and tooth loss in children. Therefore, we should look for conditions that are related to tooth loss or resorption and could be connected to delayed eruption of permanent teeth. Von-Recklinghausen disease is mentioned as a condition that can affect teeth, although it is not directly related to resorption patterns.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: Von-Recklinghausen disease\""]
