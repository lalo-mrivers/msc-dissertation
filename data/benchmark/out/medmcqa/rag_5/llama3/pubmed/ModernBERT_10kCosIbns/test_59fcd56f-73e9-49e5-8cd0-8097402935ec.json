["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The passage describes the biological properties of immunocompetent cells, which are involved in immune-mediated reactions. The text also discusses the immune response to cell surface antigens, regulated by helper and suppressor cells. Additionally, it mentions the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) and its role in antigen presentation and cell-mediated cytotoxicity. Finally, it describes antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) effector cells that lack Ia antigens. Based on this information, we can conclude that immunologically active cells include those mentioned in the text as being involved in immune reactions.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
