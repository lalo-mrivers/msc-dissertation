["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The provided documents discuss various aspects of lactobacilli, such as their presence in saliva, dental plaque, and carious dentinal plaque. However, none of the documents mention a specific Lactobacillus count (10,500 CFU) after caries activity test or provide information on how to determine the rate of caries progression based on this count. Therefore, I will analyze the available information and look for correlations between lactobacilli counts and caries experience in older adults (Streptococcus mutans, lactobacilli, and caries experience in older adults). According to this study, people with higher levels of S. mutans or lactobacilli had more untreated coronal and root caries, but not greater total caries experience.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
