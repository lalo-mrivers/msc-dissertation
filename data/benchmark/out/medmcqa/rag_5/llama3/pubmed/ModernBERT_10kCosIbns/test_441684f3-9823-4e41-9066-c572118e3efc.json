["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about Lente insulin composition. The relevant documents are focused on immunogenicity of insulin preparations, recombinant human insulin, biological activity of synthetic human insulin, and in vitro and in vivo potency of insulin analogues designed for clinical use. There is no direct information about Lente insulin composition. However, we can look at the characteristics of different types of insulin mentioned in the documents. The document 'The immunogenicity of insulin preparations' mentions porcine SCI as the least immunogenic insulin preparation and bovine SCI as having significantly reduced immunogenicity when administered multiple daily doses of neutral regular form instead of one or two daily injections of Lente form. This implies that Lente insulin is a type of SC insulin, which is amorphous in nature. Comparing this to other types of insulin mentioned, such as NPH insulin (which is also crystalline), we can infer that Lente insulin is likely composed mostly of amorphous insulin.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
