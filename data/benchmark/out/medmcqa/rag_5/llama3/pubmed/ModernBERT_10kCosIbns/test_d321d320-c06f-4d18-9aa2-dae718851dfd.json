["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about preventing damage to NiTi files due to corrosion. The relevant document is [Corrosion behavior of dental alloys coated with titanium niobium oxinitride]. It states that the coatings exhibit pores extending down to the alloy and act as galvanic elements with high source resistances and very low short circuit currents. This may lead to a conclusion that the coating will effectively reduce allergic reactions to the components of the dental alloys, which is relevant to NiTi files. However, this document does not provide information about the duration for which NiTi files should be submerged in NaOCl at 122-degree F. The other documents do not seem to be directly related to this question.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: 2 hours\""]
