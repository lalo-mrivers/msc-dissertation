["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe tropical sprue as a condition characterized by malabsorption of essential amino acids. One study found that the rate of absorption of certain amino acids was lower in patients with untreated tropical sprue compared to healthy control subjects. Another study observed that intestinal perfusion studies showed a significant reduction in the rate of absorption of glycine from a 20 mmol/l solution, but there were no significant differences in the absorption of other substances. These findings suggest that the function of tropical sprue is related to malabsorption, specifically the impaired absorption of certain amino acids and nutrients.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"None of the above\""]
