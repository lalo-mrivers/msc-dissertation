["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Since we are looking for the occlusal isthmus of a M.O. dental amalgam being resistant to fracture, I will look at the provided documents for information about the properties and behavior of dental amalgams. From the 'Dimensional change of dental amalgam' document, I can see that the dimensional stability of amalgams is affected by phase changes. This suggests that the resistance of amalgams to deformation could be related to their stability. In the 'Marginal fracture of dental amalgams' study, it is mentioned that marginal fracturing was frequently seen after 6 months' service. This implies that dental amalgams can experience deformation over time. Considering these points, I will now look at the options provided and eliminate any that do not seem to be directly related to the resistance of an occlusal isthmus of a M.O. dental amalgam to fracture.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
