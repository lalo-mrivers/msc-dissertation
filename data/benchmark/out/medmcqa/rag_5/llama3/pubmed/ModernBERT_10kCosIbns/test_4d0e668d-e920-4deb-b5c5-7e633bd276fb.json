["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) assesses a patient's level of consciousness. It has three components: Eye Opening (EO), Verbal Response (VR), and Motor Response (MR). EO ranges from 1-4, VR from 1-5, and MR from 1-6. Since the patient is opening his eyes on verbal command, that would be an E4. He's also moving all four limbs spontaneously, which would be an M6. For VR, since he's responding verbally to commands, that would be a V4. To calculate the GCS score, add up the scores for each component: 4+4+6=14. However, the maximum possible GCS score is 15, as per the scoring system. Therefore, we can infer that the patient's E2 was overlooked or not mentioned.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
