["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the amino acids with a positive charge at physiological pH. We need to analyze the side chains of each amino acid to determine their charge at this pH. From the provided documents, we can see that amino acids such as Arginine and Lysine have positively charged side chains. Therefore, based on our analysis, we can conclude that the amino acid with a positive charge is... \",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
