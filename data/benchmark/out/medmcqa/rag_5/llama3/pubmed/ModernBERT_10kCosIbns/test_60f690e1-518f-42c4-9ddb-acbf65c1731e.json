["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents provided discuss enamel crystal chemistry, surface preparation, and adaptation of composite materials to etched enamel surfaces. The relevant section is 'Enamel crystal chemistry--where do we go from here?' which states that enamel is a crystalline formation with diverse properties, including mechanical strength, cutting ability, and flexibility. This suggests that calcification in enamel starts at the Enamel matrix.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
