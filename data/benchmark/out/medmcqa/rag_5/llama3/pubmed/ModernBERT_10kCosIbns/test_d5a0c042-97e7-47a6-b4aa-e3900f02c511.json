["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the least amount of mercury required. The relevant documents describe various levels of mercury in different tissues and fluids. In the document 'Total mercury levels in selected human tissues, Idaho-1973-74', it is stated that mean levels detected were 0.08 ppm in brain tissue. Similarly, in the document 'Blood mercury concentration in an urban population', it is mentioned that the mean level appears to be 8 ppb with a range of 0 to 30 ppb. In the document 'Normal and lethal mercury levels in human beings', it is reported that the ranges of mercury content in ppm units in the two cases of poisoning were 3-5 for livers. Considering these values, it can be inferred that the least amount of mercury required is likely to be found in brain tissue.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
