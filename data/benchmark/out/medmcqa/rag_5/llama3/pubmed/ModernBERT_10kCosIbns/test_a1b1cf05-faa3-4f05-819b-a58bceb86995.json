["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The provided documents do not mention tedizolid, but instead discuss tedisamil. Therefore, the question is about tedisamil. Tedisamil's main effect was on ventricular fibrillation (VF) initiation and maintenance in isolated rat hearts. It did not influence VF initiation during 30 min of ischemia or reperfusion-induced VF initiation. However, it reduced sustained VF incidence in a concentration-dependent manner. Additionally, it caused sinus bradycardia but this was not the basis for its antiarrhythmic activity.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
