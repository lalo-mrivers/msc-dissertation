["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Intermediate filament proteins are a multigene family of proteins whose function is poorly understood. The structure of intermediate filament proteins and their assembly into intact filaments has been elucidated. Intermediate filaments are dynamic structures that require continuous incorporation of subunits to maintain normal cytoplasmic networks. This information suggests that intermediate filament proteins are not single units, but rather part of a larger structure.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
