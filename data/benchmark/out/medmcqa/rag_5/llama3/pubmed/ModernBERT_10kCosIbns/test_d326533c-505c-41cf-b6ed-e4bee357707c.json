["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe various syndromes associated with craniosynostosis, including Acrocephalosyndactyly (Apert) syndrome. The Apert syndrome is characterized by polydactyly and craniosynostosis. This suggests that the mutations involved in Apert syndrome may be relevant to other syndromic craniosynostoses. Additionally, the document on etiopathogenesis of craniosynostosis lists known causes of craniosynostosis, including monogenic disorders. The Apert syndrome is caused by FGFR2 mutations. This suggests that other syndromic craniosynostoses may also be associated with FGFR mutations.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
