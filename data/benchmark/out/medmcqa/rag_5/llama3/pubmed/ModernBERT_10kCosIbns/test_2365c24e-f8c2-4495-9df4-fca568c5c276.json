["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The provided documents discuss giant cell tumors of bone and soft tissue. According to the documents, giant cell tumors are benign neoplasms that can occur in various parts of the body, including the foot (cuneiforms) and thigh. The age range for presentation is not specified in the documents. However, giant cell tumors are locally aggressive and can occur adjacent to articular surfaces, often being large when diagnosed. This suggests that they may present at a slightly older age group than 20-40 years. The matrix of giant cell tumors consists of chondroid or osteoid tissue, not proliferating mononuclear cells. Osteoclast-like giant cells are indeed a characteristic feature of giant cell tumors, but they do not constitute the proliferative component of the tumor. Finally, while giant cell tumors are generally benign, the documents do mention that some cases can undergo malignant transformation, including lung metastasis.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
