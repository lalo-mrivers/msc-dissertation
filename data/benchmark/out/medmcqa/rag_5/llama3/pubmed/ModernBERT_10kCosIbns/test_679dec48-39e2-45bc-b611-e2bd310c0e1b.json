["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents indicate that plaque formation starts by adsorption and proliferation of individual bacteria on tooth surfaces. Plaque accumulations were also frequently located in abrasion grooves and surface pits in the enamel, and prolific plaque areas were consistently surrounded by a monolayer of bacterial cells. In separate series of experiments it was demonstrated that improved reproduction of details from the plaque could be achieved by repeating the replicating procedure.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: Uniform on all surfaces\"\n}"]
