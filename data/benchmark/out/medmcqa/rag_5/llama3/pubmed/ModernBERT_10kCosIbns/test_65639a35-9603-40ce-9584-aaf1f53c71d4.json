["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The primary aim during anesthetic management of the patient with coronary artery disease is prevention of imbalance between myocardial oxygen supply and demand. Since oxygen supply is limited by restriction of coronary blood flow, prevention of increases in demand plus maintenance of supply, rather than increases in supply, will achieve this aim. The major determinants of myocardial oxygen demand are mechanical, i.e. left ventricular wall tension, dependent in turn upon systolic pressure and ventricular volume, velocity of contraction, and heart rate.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
