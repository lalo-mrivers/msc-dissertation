["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about medicines labeled as 'store at a cool place only'. From the provided documents, it can be inferred that this label refers to refrigerated storage. Room temperature stability of drug products labeled for refrigerated storage suggests that many such products are stable at room temperature for extended periods, implying that they do not require refrigeration. However, medications not to be refrigerated were found in a survey of selected drug labelers, indicating that some products may be harmed by refrigeration. Given the lack of specific information on the medicine's requirements, it is reasonable to assume that 'store at a cool place only' implies a temperature range similar to that for refrigerated storage, which is typically around 2-8Â°C.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
