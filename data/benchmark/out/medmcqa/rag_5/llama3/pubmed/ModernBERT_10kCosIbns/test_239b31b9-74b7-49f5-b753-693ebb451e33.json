["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the proximal walls of a class II cavity on a deciduous molar. The provided documents are related to various aspects of tooth development and anatomy. However, none of them explicitly address the specific topic of the proximal walls of a class II cavity. We can draw some conclusions based on the information given. For example, the document about furcation anatomy of the first mandibular molar in dogs may provide some insight into the complexity of the tooth structure and its potential impact on periodontal disease. However, this information is not directly applicable to the proximal walls of a deciduous molar. Therefore, we must rely on general knowledge and principles to answer this question. Class II cavities typically involve the proximal surfaces of teeth. The enamel rods on these surfaces would be oriented in a specific way based on the overall shape and structure of the tooth. Proximal walls are expected to follow the direction of the enamel rods, which converge toward the occlusal surface.\",\n\"answer_choice\": A"]
