["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the innervation of stretch fibers in striated muscle. The relevant documents are related to the stretch reflex and skeletal muscle tone, but they don't specifically mention the type of fiber responsible for innervating stretch fibers. However, based on the information provided, it can be inferred that the stretch fibers are likely to be innervated by Group Ia afferent fibers, which are sensitive to length changes and are known to contribute to the stretch reflex.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: Gamma fiber\""]
