["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about what prevents fracture of MO amalgam. The provided documents talk about various aspects of amalgams, such as their properties, clinical performance, and preparation methods. None of the documents explicitly mention what prevents fracture of MO amalgam. However, we can look for information that might be related to this topic. In the first document, it mentions the creep phenomenon, which may account for early marginal fracture prior to corrosion-induced fracture. This could indicate that certain conditions or techniques may prevent fracture. In the question options, we have choices like Beveling of axiopulpal line angle, Occlusal dovetails, Pin retained amalgam, and Removal of unsupported enamel rods. These options seem to be related to the preparation and restoration of amalgam-filled teeth. Based on this information, I will choose an answer that seems most relevant.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
