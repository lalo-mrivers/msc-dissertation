["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, it can be seen that smaller fibres have a lower conduction velocity than larger ones. Additionally, there is evidence that the diameter of nerve fibers is correlated with their size and membrane properties. Specifically, the document 'A proposed relationship between circumference and conduction velocity of unmyelinated axons from normal and regenerated cat hindlimb cutaneous nerves.' shows that conduction velocity is linearly related to circumference (or diameter). Therefore, it can be inferred that the property affected due to the diameter of nerve fiber/axon is conduction velocity.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
