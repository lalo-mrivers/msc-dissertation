["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The passage does not specifically discuss the Masseter muscle. However, it talks about pinnate and multipennate arrangements of fibers in muscles. Pinnation refers to the arrangement of fibers at an angle to the whole muscle, which can increase the total physiological cross-section and total muscle force. Multipennation is a type of pinnation where many relatively short fibers are positioned in parallel but at an angle to the whole muscle, reducing per-fiber force contribution. This arrangement can compensate for the loss of fiber force due to angulation.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
