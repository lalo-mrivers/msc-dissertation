["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about an investigation that need not be done in the presence of absent thumb, radial deviation of wrist, bowing of forearm with thrombocytopenia. Based on the provided documents, we know that hereditary thrombocytopathy is a familial bleeding disorder characterized by thrombocytopenia and morphologically abnormal platelets. We also have information about etiopathogenetic considerations for moderate thrombocytopenia in young women, which includes dysendocrinopathy, consumption coagulopathy, autoimmune thrombocytopenia, and central inhibition of thrombocytopoiesis due to drugs.\n\nConsidering these factors, we can conclude that the investigation that need not be done is echocardiography.

Platelet count is a standard diagnostic test for thrombocytopenia. Karyotyping could be useful in diagnosing genetic disorders like hereditary thrombocytopathy.\n\n\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
