["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe hypothermia as a condition where the core body temperature is lower than 35Â°C. In 'Hypothermia: pathophysiology, clinical settings, and management', it is mentioned that understanding of the physiology of thermoregulation is important in light of recent advances in therapy using core rewarming. This suggests that measuring the core body temperature is crucial. The ideal site to measure his temperature would be a site that measures the core body temperature.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
