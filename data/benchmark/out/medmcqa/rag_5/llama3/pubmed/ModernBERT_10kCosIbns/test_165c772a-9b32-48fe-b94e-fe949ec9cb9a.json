["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the afferent nerve fibers of pulp. Based on the provided documents, I found that Horseradish peroxidase-labelled cells in cervical sympathetic and trigeminal nervous systems after injection of HRP into tooth pulp in monkeys and tree shrews showed that a large number of sympathetic cervical ganglion neurons project to the molar teeth from the superior, middle and inferior ganglia. This suggests that the sympathetic post-ganglionic neurons are involved in transmitting signals from the tooth pulp.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
