["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents mention the properties and behavior of high-copper dental amalgams. One study mentioned that high-copper amalgam alloys containing 5% and 10% admixed indium showed improved properties and acceptable biological behavior. Another study stated that new copper-rich silver amalgams are superior to standard amalgams in terms of creep values, which means they have better edge strength. Additionally, the dimensional changes during hardening of high-copper amalgams ranged from -3 to +19 micrometers/cm, but this has no known relationship with clinical behavior.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
