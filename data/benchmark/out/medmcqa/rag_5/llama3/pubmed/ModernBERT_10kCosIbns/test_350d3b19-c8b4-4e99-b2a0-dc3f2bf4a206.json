["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about transient tachypnea of the newborn (TTN). From the provided documents, we can see that TTN is associated with premature birth. The document 'Catecholamine abnormalities in transient tachypnoea of the premature newborn' states that low noradrenaline levels are found in preterm infants who develop TTN. Additionally, the document 'Symptomatic neonatal plethora' mentions that large placental transfusions associated with delayed clamping of the umbilical cord can cause TTN. The document 'Changing pattern of respiratory distress in newborn' states that delivery by caesarean section is associated with T.T.N.B.\n\nConsidering these points, we can conclude that TTN is commonly seen in situations involving premature birth or delayed placental transfusion. Elective caesarean section and normal vaginal delivery are not directly related to TTN.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C: Elective caesarean section\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
