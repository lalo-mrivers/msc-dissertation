["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents provided information about immunoglobulins (Ig) in different contexts. The first document mentioned the expression of IgG receptors on plasma cells, which does not directly relate to the question about Ig in GCF. The second document discussed lymphocyte function response to gammaglobulin infusion, which is also not relevant to this question.

Therefore, it seems that the answer can be found by examining the types of immunoglobulins mentioned in the documents.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
