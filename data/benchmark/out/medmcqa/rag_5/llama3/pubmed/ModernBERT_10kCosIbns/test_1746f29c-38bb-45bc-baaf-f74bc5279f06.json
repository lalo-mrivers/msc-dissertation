["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to the document [Sequence in calcification and eruption of second premolars and molars--a longitudinal study], the frequency of eruption and calcification of P2 and M2 was investigated. The developmental phase was determined on 354 orthopantomographic radiographs of orthodontic patients from Nis, aged 7 to 12 years. Eruption phase was determined on the bases of vertical relation to M1 Development phase was determined with the help of a table with 11 developmental phases. The sequence in calcification and eruption shows that P2M2 type is predominant in both sexes. In later age, eruption shows changes of type-in 31% to 39% of cases, but this percentage is lower in calcification-from 22% to 25%. Therefore, it can be concluded that the first permanent molars begin to calcify after deciduous incisors.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: About 1 year after birth\""]
