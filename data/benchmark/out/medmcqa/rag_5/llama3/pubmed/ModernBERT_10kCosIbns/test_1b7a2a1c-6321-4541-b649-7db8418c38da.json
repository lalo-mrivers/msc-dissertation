["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents mention different cephalosporins such as CGP-7174-E (cefsulodin), BL-P1654, 112384, and 112883. The document ['In vitro' activity of a new cephalosporin (CGP-7174-E or cefsulodin) against 'Pseudomonas aeruginosa' (author's transl)] states that CGP-7174-E was the most active betalactamin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, with a minimal inhibitory concentration of 3.4 micrograms/ml. This suggests that cefsulodin is an effective cephalosporin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
