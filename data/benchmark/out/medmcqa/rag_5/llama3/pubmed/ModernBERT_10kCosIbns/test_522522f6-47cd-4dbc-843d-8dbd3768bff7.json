["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the relevant documents, we can see that short-term effects of proparacaine on human corneal thickness were studied. The study showed that after instillation of 2 drops of 0.5% proparacaine, corneal thickness was significantly greater than baseline measurements for 1-2 min, and recovery to baseline occurred around 7-8 min after instillation. This suggests that the duration of action of proparacaine is at least 10 minutes.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
