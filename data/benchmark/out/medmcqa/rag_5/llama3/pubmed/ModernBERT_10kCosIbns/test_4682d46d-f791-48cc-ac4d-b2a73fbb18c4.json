["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Epinephrine is mentioned in two documents. In one document, it's stated that commercial gingival retraction cords lost substantial amounts of epinephrine while in the sulcus, with individual losses ranging from 64% to 94%. This suggests that epinephrine may be absorbed from these cords. In another document, a study examines the absorption of epinephrine from retraction cord in dogs and suggests that variability in the dl-epinephrine concentration for individual segments of commercial cord was noted. Considering this information, it's clear that epinephrine is present in gingival retraction cords. The question asks which type of retraction cord is used in hypertensive patients, but there is no specific mention of hypertensive patients in the provided documents.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: None of the above\"\n}"]
