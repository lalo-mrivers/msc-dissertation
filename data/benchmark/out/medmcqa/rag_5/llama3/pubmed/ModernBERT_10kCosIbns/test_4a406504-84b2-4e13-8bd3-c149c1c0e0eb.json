["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the balance between chest wall and lung recoil in a relaxed state. The relevant information can be found in the document 'Pulmonary and chest wall mechanics in anesthetized paralyzed humans'. This study used the technique of rapid airway occlusion during constant-flow inflation to partition the overall resistance of the lung into two compartments, one reflecting airway resistance and the other representing the viscoelastic properties of the pulmonary tissues. The chest wall resistance was also analyzed using a similar approach.\n\nFrom this analysis, we can infer that in a relaxed state, the balance between chest wall and lung recoil occurs at Functional Residual Capacity (FRC), which is defined as the volume of air remaining in the lungs after normal expiration. This is supported by the study's findings on the behavior of elastance of the lung and chest wall.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D: FRC.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
