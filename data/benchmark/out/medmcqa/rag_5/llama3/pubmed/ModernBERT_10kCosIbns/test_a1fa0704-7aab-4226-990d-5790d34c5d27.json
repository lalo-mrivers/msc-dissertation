["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the association of a (gd) T cell. From the given documents, we know that CD4 positive T cells are also known as TH2 subpopulation and include the TH2 lymphocytes. The abstract mentions that GD1a was characteristically only detected in TH2 cells. Additionally, it states that significant expression was seen in CD4 positive (helper) T cells which include the TH2 subpopulation. Therefore, we can conclude that a (gd) T cell is associated with CD4.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
