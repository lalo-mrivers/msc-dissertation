["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents suggest that the focus is on patient safety and radiation protection. The Danish National Institute of Radiation Hygiene study reported mean values of skin dose for different dental X-ray exposures. The spread in doses was due to a combination of inappropriate film processing and exposure time. Interviews with staff confirmed that films are frequently processed until the desired density is obtained by visual estimation. This implies that there is a need for standardized film processing and exposure times to minimize radiation exposure. Moreover, the study on effective dosage equivalents in evaluating radiation burden in patients in stomatologic roentgenology reported high doses for dental X-ray investigations. Therefore, it is crucial to establish guidelines for dental X-ray operators to ensure patient safety. The maximum recommended dose for dental X-ray operator in a week should be based on these considerations.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B: 10 roentgen\"\n}"]
