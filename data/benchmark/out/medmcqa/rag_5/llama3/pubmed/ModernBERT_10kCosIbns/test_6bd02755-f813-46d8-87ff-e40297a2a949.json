["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the hormone secreted by female adrenal glands. According to the documents, human adrenal glands produce considerable amounts of DHEA (dehydroepiandrosterone), but it was concluded that rat and mouse adrenals lack the enzyme necessary to synthesize adrenal C-19 steroids including DHEA. Since this conclusion is based on rodent studies, we need to rely on human data. The documents do not mention any specific hormone secreted by female adrenal glands. However, we can infer that it's unlikely to be testosterone (B) or androstenedione as these hormones are primarily produced by the testes. Progesterone (A) is a possibility but there is no direct evidence in the provided documents. Estrogen (C) is also possible as it is involved in reproductive processes, but again, there is no direct evidence.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
