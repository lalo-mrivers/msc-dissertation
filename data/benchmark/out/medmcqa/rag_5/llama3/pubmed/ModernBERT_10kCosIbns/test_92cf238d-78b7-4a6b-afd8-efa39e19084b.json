["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the provided documents, it can be seen that cross-linking agents were added to various resins and their effects on mechanical properties such as Brinell hardness, tensile strength, impact strength, and transverse strength were studied. In the first document, the best composition was found to be 5% neopentylglycol dimethacrylate in MMA, suggesting that cross-linking can improve mechanical properties. The second document shows that increase in chain lengths of cross-linking agents led to a decrease in tensile and transverse bend strengths but an increase in impact strength. The third document does not provide direct information on the effect of cross-linking on resin properties. The fourth document focuses on the adhesion of new resin layers and bonding, rather than the effects of cross-linking on mechanical properties. Therefore, based on these findings, it can be concluded that cross-linking in resins helps increasing...\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: All of the above\""]
