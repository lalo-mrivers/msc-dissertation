["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the origin of certain cell types. The provided documents describe the development and differentiation of endodermal cells during gastrulation and implantation in various species. We can infer that endodermal cells give rise to visceral and parietal endoderm, as well as other derivatives like hepatocytes. The text also mentions the origin of primary endoderm from the inner cell mass (ICM). This information allows us to identify which cell types are of endodermal origin.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
