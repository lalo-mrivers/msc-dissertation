["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about junctional epithelium. The provided documents do not mention 'junctional epithelium' directly, but they discuss different types of epithelial cells and their functions. The document 'Stromal regulation of epithelial function' mentions the importance of stromal-epithelial interactions, but it does not provide information about junctional epithelium. The document 'Ultrastructural specialization of intestinal epithelium over Peyer's patches in the bonnet monkey, Macaca radiata' describes the specialized cells called M cells or 'microfold' cells, which are involved in antigen uptake and transport. However, this document does not provide information about junctional epithelium either. Therefore, we need to look for other clues that might help us answer the question.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
