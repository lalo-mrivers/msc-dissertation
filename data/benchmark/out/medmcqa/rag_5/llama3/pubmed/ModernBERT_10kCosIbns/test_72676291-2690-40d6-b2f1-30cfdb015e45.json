["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the effectiveness of glucagon injection for managing persistent hypoglycemia. The relevant documents mention that glucagon can cause a rise in blood sugar concentrations, but its effect on blood glucose levels depends on various factors such as the presence or absence of insulin deficiency. In patients with idiopathic reactive hypoglycemia, glucagon may actually worsen the diabetic state when insulin is not available. This suggests that glucagon injection may be less effective for managing persistent hypoglycemia in certain situations, such as in infants who are still dependent on maternal insulin.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
