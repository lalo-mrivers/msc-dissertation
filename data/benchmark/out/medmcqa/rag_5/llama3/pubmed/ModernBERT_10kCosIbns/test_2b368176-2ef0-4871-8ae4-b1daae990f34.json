["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the accessory canals' frequency in the apical third. From the provided documents, we have information on the root canal anatomy of the dog (apical root canal anatomy) and the root canal morphology of the maxillary first premolar. The 'sprinkler-rose' anatomy of the dog's apical root canal suggests numerous narrow channels radiating peripherally through the dentin and cementum, which is similar to the concept of accessory canals. In the context of the maxillary first premolar, lateral canals are mentioned as occurring mainly in the apical region. Therefore, it is likely that the accessory canals are most numerous in the apical third.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D: None of the above\"}"]
