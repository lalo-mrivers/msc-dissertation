["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for a risk factor that is NOT associated with contrast-induced nephropathy. From the given documents, we can see that diabetics with pre-existing renal impairment are at higher risk of developing contrast nephropathy. Similarly, patients with severe renal failure (pre-contrast serum creatinine greater than 200 mumol/liter) and those with high osmolar contrast agent are also at increased risk. Obesity is not mentioned as a risk factor in the given documents. Dehydration might be a potential risk factor, but it's not specifically mentioned as a predisposing factor for contrast-induced nephropathy.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C: Obesity\""]
