["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to the provided documents, intermediate filaments are composed of a multigene family of proteins. Monomeric intermediate filament proteins refer to individual subunits that make up the polymerized filaments. The documents highlight various intermediate filament proteins such as vimentin, keratin, and desmin. Tubulin is not mentioned in relation to intermediate filaments. Therefore, it can be inferred that tubulin is not a monomeric intermediate filament.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
