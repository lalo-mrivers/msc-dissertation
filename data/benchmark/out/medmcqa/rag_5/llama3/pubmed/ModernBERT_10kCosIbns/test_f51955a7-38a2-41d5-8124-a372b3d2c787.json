["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents mention several metal alloys used in orthodontic wires, including stainless steel, nickel-titanium (NiTi), beta-titanium, and titanium molybdenum. None of these alloys contain chromium. Cobalt is not mentioned as an alloy component either. Silicon is also not mentioned as a significant component of any of the alloys. Carbon is present in some forms, such as KCl crystals, but it's not the metal alloy that affects the hardness of orthodontic wires.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
