["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents describe the clotting process, thrombolytic therapy, and the stability of blood clots. It is mentioned that thrombus compartments are porous enough for immunoconjugates of relatively big size to penetrate. The colorimetric assay used to measure clot lysis suggests that the effectiveness of thrombolytic therapy depends on the accessibility of thrombus compartments to plasminogen activators. The phenomenonological analysis of the clotting curve reveals a linear relationship between clotting time and thrombin amidase activity, which is rate-limiting with respect to the subsequent aggregation process. This suggests that extensive cross-linking of blood clots occurs through factor XIII, also known as blood coagulation factor XIII.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
