["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about identifying an organism that grows on Charcoal Yeast Extract Medium. The passage does not mention anything specific to this medium, so we need to look for general information about yeast identification methods. In the passage 'Rapid identification of yeasts by serological methods', it talks about a combined serological and biological method.
