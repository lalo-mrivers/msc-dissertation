["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about children with germline retinoblastoma developing other primary malignancies. In the 'Retinoblastoma-a clinical survey and its genetic implications' document, it is mentioned that 12 out of 50 patients developed a new tumour over a period ranging from 2 months to 10 years after primary treatment. This suggests that children with germline retinoblastoma are more likely to develop other primary malignancies.\n\nIn the 'Malignancies in relatives of retinoblastoma patients' document, it is mentioned that most of the malignant tumours had been carcinomas, and in two families, relatives died due to leukaemia. This suggests a higher risk of developing other types of cancer.\n\nThe 'Retinoblastoma in the first year of life' document mentions that children who were treated in the first year of life frequently develop second non-ocular tumors because they harbor the germinal mutation and receive radiation. This also suggests a higher risk of developing other primary malignancies.\n\nBased on these findings, it is likely that children with germline retinoblastoma are more likely to develop other primary malignancies in their later lifetime course.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
