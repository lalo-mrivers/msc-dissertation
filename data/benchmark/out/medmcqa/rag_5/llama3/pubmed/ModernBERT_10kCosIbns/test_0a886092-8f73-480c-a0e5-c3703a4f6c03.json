["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about what is derived from the mesonephros. We can look at the provided documents to find the answer. From the document 'Histochemical localization of Mg2+-Na+-K+-adenosine triphosphatase in different stages of the sheep mesonephros', we can see that the collecting tubule, distal tubule, and glomeruli are all part of the mesonephros. In the document 'A growth-promoting influence from the mesonephros during limb outgrowth', we learn that the mesonephros plays a role in normal limb development and provides some signal for limb outgrowth. Finally, in the document 'Mesonephroid carcinoma of the ovary', we see that the mesonephros is involved in ovarian carcinomas. None of these documents mention glomerulus as being derived from the mesonephros, so it must be excluded.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
