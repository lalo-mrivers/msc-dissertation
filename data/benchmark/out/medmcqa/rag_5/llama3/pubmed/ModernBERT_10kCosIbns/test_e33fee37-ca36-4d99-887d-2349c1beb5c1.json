["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Comparing the characteristics of vitreous humor to blood, we can analyze the provided documents. From 'Comparative toxicology in vitreous humor and blood', we know that patients with long survival times or dying from unrelated causes reveal drug values approaching unity when comparing blood and vitreous concentrations. This suggests that the ratios reached at equilibrium depend on solubility of the drug in vitreous humor, lipid solubility, and percentage protein-bound in the blood. The documents do not provide direct information about the concentration of specific substances like sodium, potassium, glucose, or ascorbate. However, we can look for clues from other studies. In 'Determination of glucose in human vitreous humor', various analytical methods give different results, indicating that glucose concentrations in vitreous humor may vary.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
