["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the maximum permissible dose of Articaine in a healthy patient. In the first document '[Methaemoglobin-behaviour due to carticaine (= Ultracain) (author's transl)]', it mentions that Carticaine in a dose of 1,35 mg/kg did not influence the concentration of methaemoglobin. This suggests that this dose is within the safe range. In the second document '[Efficiency of a 2% epinephrine-free Articain solution (Ultracain 2%) for dental local anesthesia]', it mentions that the estimated local anesthetic effect was subjective, but no information about the maximum permissible dose is provided. The third and fourth documents do not provide relevant information to answer this question.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
