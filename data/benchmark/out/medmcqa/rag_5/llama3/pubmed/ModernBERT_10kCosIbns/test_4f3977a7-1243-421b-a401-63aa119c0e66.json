["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents discuss the detoxification of alcoholics without psychoactive drugs. The first document states that most community-referred, ambulatory chronic alcoholics can be detoxified quickly and safety without the use of psychoactive drugs. Therefore, I will focus on the potential choices for drugs used in detoxification of chronic alcoholics. Flumazenil is a benzodiazepine receptor antagonist often used to reverse benzodiazepine effects. Disulfiram is an aldehyde dehydrogenase inhibitor commonly used as an aversion therapy drug. Acamprosate and naltrexone are both medications used in the treatment of alcohol dependence, but they do not directly facilitate detoxification.\n\nAccordingly, I will eliminate A (Flumazenil) because it is often used for reversing benzodiazepine effects rather than detoxifying chronic alcoholics. Disulfiram (B) and Acamprosate/C (although their primary use is in the treatment of alcohol dependence, they are not directly used in detoxification). Naltrexone (D) can be eliminated because it does not have a direct role in detoxification.\n\nThe correct answer should be a drug that is not commonly used or indicated for detoxifying chronic alcoholics. Among the choices provided, none of them fit this criteria except one: B Disulfiram.\", \n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
