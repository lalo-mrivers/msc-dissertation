["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents discuss various dopamine receptor antagonists, such as raclopride and cinitapride. Cinitapride enhanced the contractile response induced by electrical stimulation in the guinea-pig myenteric plexus-longitudinal muscle strip preparations. Raclopride, on the other hand, increased intake of sucrose solutions, but its effect was not related to calorie content. The documents do not mention prucalopride directly. However, the studies mentioned various benzamides, which are a class of compounds that include cinitapride and sultopride. Sultopride is known for its effects on dopamine receptors, specifically as a D2 receptor antagonist. Prucalopride is also a benzamide derivative and has been shown to be a selective D2 receptor agonist. Therefore, based on the available information, prucalopride can be classified as a dopamine receptor agonist.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A: 5HT4 agonist\""]
