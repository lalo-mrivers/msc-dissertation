["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"This question does not provide any relevant information about the effects of lower incisor position on the soft tissue profile, nor does it mention mandibular arch form or the mathematical model for orthodontic expansion. We should look at the documents that discuss orthodontic appliances and muscle forces. The document 'The use of muscle forces by simple orthodontic appliances' is relevant to this question as it describes how muscles can be enlisted to correct dental malocclusions, which includes intrusion of teeth. Therefore, we need to find a clue in this document about the force required for intruding four mandibular anterior teeth.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
