["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the histopathological aspects of inflammatory periapical lesions, including the innervation. A bacteriological evaluation of 58 periapical lesions shows that cultures were positive for bacteria in 51 cases while histologically, bacteria were seen in only 8 cases. The study also isolated 50 different species of bacteria, with Bacteroides species found in 17 cultures. No specific mention is made of retreatment cases of periapical abscess or the most common organism found in such cases. However, based on the overall bacteriological and histological evaluation, it can be inferred that anaerobic bacteria may be commonly found in periapical abscesses.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
