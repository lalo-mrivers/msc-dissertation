["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks which test may be abnormal in disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). DIC is characterized by widespread microthrombosis, macrothrombosis, and hemorrhage. The most impaired coagulation tests mentioned in the clinical and laboratory aspects of DIC article are prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, platelet count, and thrombin time.

Therefore, the correct answer is C: D-timer levels.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
