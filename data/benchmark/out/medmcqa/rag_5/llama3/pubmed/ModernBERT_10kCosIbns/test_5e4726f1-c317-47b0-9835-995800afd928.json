["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"After reviewing the documents, we can identify that plaque is composed of microorganisms and a nonstructured matrix. The study on multibacterial artificial plaque shows that the caries-like lesion produced under the plaque was observed in enamel sections, and the acids produced in both culture media and artificial plaque were similar in composition and type to those produced in natural plaque after sugar attack. This suggests that plaque is primarily composed of microorganisms with some intercellular matrix. Therefore, we can conclude that the early plaque consists of a mixture of minerals, but not necessarily Ca, PO4, and K in specific proportions.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
