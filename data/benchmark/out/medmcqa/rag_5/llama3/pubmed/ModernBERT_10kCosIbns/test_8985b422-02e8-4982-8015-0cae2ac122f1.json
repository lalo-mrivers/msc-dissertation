["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the management of overdosage of Fibrinolytics. Fibrinolytics are a class of medications that help break down blood clots. The options provided are all related to hemostasis and coagulation, but only one of them is directly used in managing overdosage of Fibrinolytics.\n\nEpsilon amino Caproic Acid (A) is an antifibrinolytic agent that inhibits the action of plasminogen activators, which are enzymes involved in fibrinolysis. It would be useful in managing overdosage of Fibrinolytics.\n\nTranexamic Acid (B) is a synthetic analog of amino acids and has antifibrinolytic properties. It would also be useful in managing overdosage of Fibrinolytics.\n\nDDAVP (C) is a synthetic analogue of vasopressin, which plays a role in regulating blood pressure and hemostasis. While it might have some effects on coagulation, it's not directly related to fibrinolysis, so it wouldn't be used to manage overdosage of Fibrinolytics.\n\nFFP (D) is Fresh Frozen Plasma, which contains clotting factors that can help regulate bleeding. While it might be used in managing excessive bleeding caused by Fibrinolytics, it's not directly an antidote for Fibrinolytic overdose.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C: DDAVP.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
