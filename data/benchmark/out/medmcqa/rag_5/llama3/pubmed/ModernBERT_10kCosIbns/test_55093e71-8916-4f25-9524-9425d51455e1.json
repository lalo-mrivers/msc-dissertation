["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking which factor would favour the development of Respiratory Distress Syndrome (RDS). From the provided documents, we know that RDS can be predicted with reasonable accuracy at three days of age, and that poor outcome can be predicted using gestational age and ventilatory index number 1 (VI1) at day 3. We also know that term birth does not necessarily mean the absence of RDS. Air bronchogram on chest x-ray is a symptom of RDS, but it's not a risk factor. The onset of distress after 6 hours of birth may be a late presentation of RDS, but it's not a predictive factor either. Antenatal corticosteroids are actually used to prevent RDS, so having a history of receiving them would actually decrease the likelihood of developing RDS. Therefore, none of the options A, B, or C favour the development of RDS.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: Term birth\""]
