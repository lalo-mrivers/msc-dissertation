["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The passage provided describes the three-dimensional architecture of the Golgi apparatus in Sertoli cells of the rat. It highlights two distinct types of regions: the 'saccular region' and the 'intersaccular connecting region'. The saccular region corresponds to the conventional stack of saccules, while the intersaccular connecting region is made up of anastomotic tubules that bridge adjacent stacks. Based on this information, it appears that Golgi bodies function in sorting processes.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C: Sorting of glycoproteins\""]
