["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the provided documents, we can see that somatostatin is a peptide hormone that has been characterized as a releasing inhibiting factor (somatotropin release-inhibiting factor). This indicates that it plays a role in regulating the release of pituitary hormones. In particular, it is known to inhibit the release of growth hormone and other anterior pituitary hormones. Therefore, it can be inferred that somatostatin is primarily involved in inhibitory control of hypothalamus on anterior pituitary hormones.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
