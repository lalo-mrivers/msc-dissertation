["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the single most effective method of reducing patient somatic exposure when taking radiographs. The relevant documents mention variations in x-ray exposures to patients due to differences in fluoroscopic exposure rate, kVp and filtration, choice of screen-film combination, and attenuation of table tops and phototimers. It also mentions that the use of modern, properly adjusted equipment can make radiographic examinations virtually 'safe'. This suggests that reducing exposure is possible through adjusting equipment settings rather than using shielding or changing film type.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
