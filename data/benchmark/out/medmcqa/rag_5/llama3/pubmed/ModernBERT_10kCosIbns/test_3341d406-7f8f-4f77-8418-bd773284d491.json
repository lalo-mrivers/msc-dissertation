["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"There is no mention of the inter radicular bone in the provided documents. However, we can look for relevant information about bones that might help us answer this question. In the document 'Comparative study of iliac crest and subchondral femoral bone in osteoarthritic patients', it talks about trabecular bone changes in selected regions of the femoral head. Trabecular bone is a type of cancellous bone, which is porous with a network of bony struts. This information does not directly relate to inter radicular bones, but it gives us an idea of what cancellous bone looks like. In the document 'Chip fracture through the superior articular facet with compressive cervical radiculopathy', there is no mention of inter radicular bones either. Finally, in the document 'Experimental fracture healing: evaluation using radionuclide bone imaging: concise communication', it talks about a rabbit model to observe the course of fracture healing and establish criteria for distinguishing nonunion and delayed healing from normal healing. This information does not provide any clues about inter radicular bones as well.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
