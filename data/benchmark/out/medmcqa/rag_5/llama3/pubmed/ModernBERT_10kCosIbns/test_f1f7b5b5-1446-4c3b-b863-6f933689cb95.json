["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking which option increases callus formation. The relevant documents are 'Histology and histomorphometry of bone regeneration after experimental injuries' and 'External callus development on ultrasound and its mechanical correlation'. From the first document, it is known that the mode of injury affects primary osteochondrogenic callus formation. This suggests that the degree of trauma may influence callus formation. The second document shows a direct correlation between ultrasonographic changes and the calcification of the periosteal callus. Based on this information, options A, C, and D are likely to increase callus formation as they all involve some degree of immobilization or stabilization, which would potentially increase the trauma to the bone.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
