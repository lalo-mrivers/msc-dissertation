["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The anterior fibers of the levator ani muscle consist of three layers: pelvic, middle, and perineal. The pelvic layer is attached to the capsule of the prostate or adventitia of the lateral wall of vagina, intermingles with the longitudinal muscle layer of the anal canal, and is continuous with the fibres of the opposite side behind the recto-anal junction. The middle layer forms a round free border of the muscle that bounds the levator hiatus and blends with the deep part of the external anal sphincter, partly joining the anococcygeal ligament. The perineal layer surrounds the superficial part of the external anal sphincter.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
