["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"After reviewing the documents, I found that there is no specific information about the optimum BMP dose for osteogenesis. However, I did find some information about the chemotactic response of human blood monocytes to osteogenin and recombinant human BMP-2B (rhBMP-2B) at concentrations ranging from 10-100 fg/ml (0.3-3 fM). This suggests that low doses of BMP may be effective in inducing chemotaxis.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B: 2.5 Î¼g/mL\""]
