["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for a bone that can be described as 'bat with extended wings'. The passage about bat wings talks about the structure of the wing bones. It mentions that comparable right and left wing bones failed to demonstrate one-sided dominance, and that some bones from one side are heavier, some are lighter than those from the other side. This suggests that the bone weights are balanced for flight. The question does not require knowledge of specific bat anatomy, but rather a general understanding of the structure of wings.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
