["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to the biomechanical model of the human mandible, the muscular forces produced by the masseter, medial pterygoid, temporal, and superior lateral pterygoid muscle components can be resolved into components orthogonal and parallel to the temporal articular plane. The masseter, medial pterygoid, and temporal muscles are all jaw elevator muscles that contribute to mandibular elevation. Therefore, we can conclude that these three muscles (masseter, medial pterygoid, and temporal) are elevators of the mandible.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
