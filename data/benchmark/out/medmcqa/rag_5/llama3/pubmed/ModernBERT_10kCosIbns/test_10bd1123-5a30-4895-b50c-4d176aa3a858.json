["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the provided documents, we can infer that primary cartilage is characterized as a derivative of the chondroskeleton. In the context of craniofacial morphogenesis, it has an intrinsic morphogenetic potential and is less adaptive to external influences. This information suggests that primary cartilaginous joints are likely to be non-mobile or minimally mobile, as they are not associated with membrane bone and do not require mechanical load for their maintenance.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B: Synchondrosis\"\n}"]
