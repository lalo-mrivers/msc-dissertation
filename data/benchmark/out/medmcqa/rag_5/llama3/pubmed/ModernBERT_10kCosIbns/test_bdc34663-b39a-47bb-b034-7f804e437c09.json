["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the effects of high doses of haloperidol on movement disorders. In 'Dyskinesias evoked in monkeys by weekly administration of haloperidol', it is described that increasing the dose to 0.5 milligram per kilogram elicited movement disorders reliably after each weekly dose for almost 2 years. This suggests an experimental model for determining the etiology of drug-induced movement disorders, which may be relevant to our patient's symptoms. Furthermore, in 'Clinical and biochemical parameters during neuroleptic treatment', it is noted that patients receiving haloperidol may develop extrapyramidal motor system effects, such as parkinsonism, after 5 days of treatment. Our patient has been on the medication for many days, and his recent symptoms of inner restlessness and urges to move are consistent with these effects.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
