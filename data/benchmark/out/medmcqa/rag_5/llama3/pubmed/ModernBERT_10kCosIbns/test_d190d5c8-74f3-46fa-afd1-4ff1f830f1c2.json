["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking what is NOT TRUE about fresh frozen plasma. We need to identify the correct information about FFP from the provided documents. According to the guidelines for the use of FFP, it should only be used in certain defined situations, such as replacement of single coagulation factor deficiencies or immediate reversal of warfarin effect. It's not indicated for treating hypovolaemia or plasma exchange procedures. The analysis of FFP administration suggests that most of the units were used to treat patients with liver disease or receiving coumadin. The freezing technique and quality of FFP shows that coagulation factor VIII activity was reduced by rapid freezing, but it didn't affect the levels of factors V and von Willebrand factor. Finally, the pattern of FFP transfusion in Veterans General Hospital-Taichung indicates that most of the units were used for clotting support or blood pressure support.\n\nBased on this information, we can conclude that statement D 'To be used within 30 minutes of having trauma' is not a correct indication for using FFP. This is because there is no mention of such a use in any of the provided documents.\", \"answer_choice\": C}"]
