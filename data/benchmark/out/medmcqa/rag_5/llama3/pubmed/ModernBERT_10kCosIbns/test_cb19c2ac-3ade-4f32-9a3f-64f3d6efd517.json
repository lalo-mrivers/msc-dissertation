["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Upon reading the relevant documents, I noticed that one of the papers describes a syndrome of hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia with normal teeth, peculiar facies, pigmentary disturbances, psychomotor and growth retardation, bilateral nuclear cataract, and other signs. Another paper describes anhidrotic ectodermal dysplasia (AED) characterized by a triad of inability to sweat, dental abnormalities, and hypotrichosis. I also saw that autosomal recessive ectodermal dysplasia is characterized by hypohidrosis, xeroderma, hypotrichosis, dystrophy of the teeth, benign acanthosis nigricans, and furrowed tongue, among other symptoms. Considering these descriptions, it appears that defective or absence of sweat glands (option C) are a common feature in various forms of ectodermal dysplasia.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
