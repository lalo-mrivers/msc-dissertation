["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Since the question is about the most used selective medium for Streptococcus mutans, I will analyze the documents to find a relevant mention. The document 'Physiological characterization of nutritionally variant streptococci' mentions Todd-Hewitt broth as a medium that supports growth of Streptococcus mutans. This suggests that Todd-Hewitt broth may be used for culturing Streptococcus mutans. However, none of the other documents provide direct information on selective media for Streptococcus mutans.\n\nBased on this analysis, I will consider the option B: Mitus salivarius bacitracin agar as a possible correct answer, since it is mentioned in the document 'Biosynthesis of streptolidine moiety of streptothricins by Streptomyces noursei JA 3890b' as a medium used for studying streptococci.\n\nHowever, upon further analysis, I realize that Mitus salivarius bacitracin agar is not specifically mentioned as a selective medium for Streptococcus mutans. Therefore, I will eliminate this option.\n\nConsidering the other options, A: Mac conkey medium and D: Tellurite medium are not relevant to Streptococcus mutans. C: Nutrient agar does not have any specific information on streptococci in the provided documents.\n\nTherefore, based on the analysis of the available documents, I conclude that there is no specific selective medium mentioned for Streptococcus mutans among the given options.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
