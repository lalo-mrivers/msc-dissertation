["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents describe thyroid storm as a condition that arises from mechanisms other than a simple increase in serum triiodothyronine concentration. One of the patients had subclinical hypoadrenocorticism involved in the pathogenesis of thyroid storm, suggesting that adrenal insufficiency can contribute to the development of thyroid storm. The article on rational therapy for thyroid storm suggests that treatment should focus on inhibiting catecholamine-mediated peripheral effects, inhibiting thyroid hormone synthesis and conversion, blocking glandular release of thyroid hormones, and providing general supportive therapy.
