["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The passage describes the adhesion of synthetic organic polymer to soft tissue. It states that some aromatic and n-alkyl isocynates can significantly improve the adhesion of a fast-setting polyurethane prepolymer to internal tissue. The benzoyl group attached to tissue after reaction makes the tissue/polymer interface more compatible, resulting in good adhesion. The hydrophobic benzoyl group binds to the tissue surface.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
