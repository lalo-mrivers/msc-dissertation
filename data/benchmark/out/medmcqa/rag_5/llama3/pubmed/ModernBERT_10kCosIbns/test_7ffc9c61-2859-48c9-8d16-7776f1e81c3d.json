["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for what is NOT true about COPD. Based on the provided documents, we know that COPD is characterized by obstruction to airflow on expiration. The definition and classification of COPD states that it covers a spectrum of diseases with a common denominator, obstruction to airflow on expiration. This means that there will be decreased lung function, specifically FEV1. We also know from the Management of COPD document that one of the main goals is to improve pulmonary gas exchange by identification of the type or types of COPD present and tailoring of the therapeutic regimen to the severity and mechanism of obstruction. This implies that there may be an initial decrease in FEV1, but it will depend on the stage of the disease.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
