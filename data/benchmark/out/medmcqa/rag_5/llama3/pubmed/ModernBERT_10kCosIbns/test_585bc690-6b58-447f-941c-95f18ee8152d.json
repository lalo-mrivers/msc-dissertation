["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the wedging technique to be used in amalgam filling when there is a wide buccolingual space or a cavity with proximal box in a lower molar. The relevant documents provide information on different types of amalgam restorations and their marginal adaptation, but do not specifically discuss the wedge technique. However, the study on extracoronal amalgam restorations provides some insight into how to achieve fine marginal adaptation without using pins for retention. This suggests that a single or double wedge technique might be used to achieve this adaptation.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
