["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents provide information on bacterial endocarditis. Bacterial endocarditis is described as being present in 31 cases out of 192 consecutive patients with septicemia admitted to a hospital for infectious diseases (document 1). In document 2, 42 cases of bacterial endocarditis are reviewed, and infection was restricted to one or both left-sided valves in 31 cases. Document 3 reviews the surgical management of bacterial endocarditis, stating that the aortic valve was predominantly involved with the mitral valve running a distant second. Document 4 studies 83 patients with infective endocarditis and finds that fever was present in 75 (90.4%) cases, cardiac murmur in 76 (91.5%), and anemia was present in 66 cases (79.5%). Based on these findings, it can be inferred that bacterial endocarditis is most commonly seen in association with valvular heart disease.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
