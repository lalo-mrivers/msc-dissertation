["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the bacteria responsible for progressing dental caries. The provided documents highlight the importance of understanding the aetiology of dental caries, including the interaction of two groups of variable factors: those affecting tooth resistance and those determining cariogenicity of the environment. Based on the acidogenic theory of dental caries aetiology, which is supported by experimental evidence, the bacteria responsible for progressing dental caries are likely to be those that contribute to acid production.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
