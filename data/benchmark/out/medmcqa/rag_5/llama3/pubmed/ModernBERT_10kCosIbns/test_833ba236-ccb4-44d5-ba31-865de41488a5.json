["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"After resection of posterior pituitary, the question asks what hormones would be given. The relevant documents do not mention the specific treatment or hormone replacement after resection of the pituitary gland. However, we can infer that glucagon is not mentioned as a hormone to be replaced because it is produced by the pancreas, not the pituitary gland. Thyroxine and mineralocoicoid are both hormones regulated by the pituitary gland (TSH and ACTH respectively), so they would likely need replacement after resection. Estradiol is also a hormone regulated by the pituitary gland (FSH), so it would likely need replacement as well.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
