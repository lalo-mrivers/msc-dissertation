["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to the diagnosis and surgical treatment of 'H-type' tracheoesophageal fistulas document, ordinary radiologic methods failed to establish the diagnosis. It is mentioned that the angulation of the fistula usually prevents contrast medium in the esophagus from entering the trachea, especially with the subject upright. This implies that a simple chest X-ray or CT scan may not be sufficient for diagnosing an H-type tracheoesophageal fistula. On the other hand, air easily passes from the trachea to the esophagus, eventually producing megaesophagus which may be confused with the picture of achalasia. This suggests that visualization of the internal anatomy is necessary. Therefore, I conclude that direct visualization of the trachea and esophagus such as tracheo-bronchoscopy or esophagoscopy is required to establish the diagnosis.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
