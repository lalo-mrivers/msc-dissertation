["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to the given documents, we know that systolic blood pressure (SBP) greater than 175 mmHg is considered high. In this question, we are given a sample of normal healthy males with a mean SBP of 130 and a normal distribution. This means that most individuals will have an SBP around the mean, but there will be some outliers who have higher or lower values. The problem asks us to identify people with systolic blood pressure more than 130. We can't directly compare this value to the given choices, as they seem to represent a percentage or count of individuals rather than actual BP values. However, we can infer that these individuals will be above the mean of 130. Since the choices are percentages or counts, we need to consider which option would likely correspond to people with higher SBP.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
