["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks which content is NOT part of the mesorectal fascia. We need to analyze the provided documents to find out what the mesorectal fascia contains. From 'A reconsideration of the ischiorectal fossa' and 'Radiological diagnosis of anorectal malformations', we know that the muscles of the pelvic floor, including the Musculus canalis ani, are important for continence and anorectal diseases. However, these documents do not specifically mention the contents of the mesorectal fascia. From 'Peritoneal fine structure of inguinal hernia: a transmission electron microscope study', we learn about the peritoneum and its relationship with hernias, but this does not provide information about the mesorectal fascia. Therefore, we need to look at 'Intraoral-mucosal-xenogenous fascial grafting' which mentions transplanted fascia adhering firmly to underlying tissue and surrounding epithelium. This suggests that the mesorectal fascia may contain some type of fascia or connective tissue. Based on this information, we can eliminate options A-D as they all seem to be related to blood vessels, lymph nodes, or nerves which are not typical contents of a fascial structure.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
