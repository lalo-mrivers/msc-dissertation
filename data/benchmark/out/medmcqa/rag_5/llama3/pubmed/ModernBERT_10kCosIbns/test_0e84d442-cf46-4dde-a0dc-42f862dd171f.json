["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to the documents, unstable angina pectoris is a condition where intracoronary platelet aggregation and thrombus formation secondary to fissuring or rupture of atheromatous plaques occur. Nitrates have been shown to be beneficial in limiting platelet aggregation and are used in the vast majority of patients with unstable angina. The major factors in the pathogenesis of unstable angina include intracoronary platelet aggregation and thrombus formation, which is associated with coronary vasoconstriction due to release of constrictor materials from aggregating platelets and deficiency of endothelium-related vasodilator activity. This suggests that nitrates may be effective in relaxing the coronary vessels.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A: Coronary vasodilation\""]
