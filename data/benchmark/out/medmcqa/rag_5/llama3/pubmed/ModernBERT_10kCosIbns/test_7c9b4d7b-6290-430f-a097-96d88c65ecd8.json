["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe various tracking techniques used for different purposes. The first document discusses digital range-gated echocardiographic tracking, which is used to provide real-time and continuous position and velocity measurements on selected heart structures. The second document talks about localization of disappearance of a light target during eye movements, where subjects track the movement with their eyes and determine the place of its disappearance. The third and fourth documents discuss psychophysiological characteristics of combined activities, including visual measurement and sensomotor reaction of choice against tracking sinusoidal signals at different sighting angles. None of these techniques involve administering medication or monitoring blood levels. Therefore, options A, B, C, and D are not applicable.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"None of the above (i.e., none of the choices A-D)\""]
