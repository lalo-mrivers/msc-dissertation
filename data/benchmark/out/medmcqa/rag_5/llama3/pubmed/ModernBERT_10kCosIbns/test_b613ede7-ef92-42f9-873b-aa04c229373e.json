["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the formation of dental plaque. From the provided documents, it can be inferred that plaque formation starts by adsorption and proliferation of individual bacteria on tooth surfaces (Replica study of plaque formation on human tooth surfaces). Enzymes are not directly involved in this process. The studies on human dental plaque (Studies on human dental plaque) do not mention enzymes reacting to form plaque. Therefore, the answer cannot be related to enzymatic reactions.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
