["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents provided mention the use of prilocaine for various purposes such as intraosseous injections, IV regional anesthesia, and peripheral nerve stimulation. There is no mention of agranulocytosis or hepatic dysfunction as complications of prilocaine. The document 'Hypersensitivity to prilocaine' reports a case of anaphylactoid reaction with late onset to prilocaine, which could be considered a complication. However, the main concern mentioned in this document is the hypersensitivity and not agranulocytosis or hepatic dysfunction. In the document 'Prilocaine effect on aconitine-induced arrhythmias', it is reported that prilocaine decreased blood pressure in normal animals, which could be considered a potential complication. However, this is not the most common complication of prilocaine as reported in other studies.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
