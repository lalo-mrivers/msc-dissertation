["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about what is included in active tissue engineering. From the provided documents, it seems that tissue engineering is the application of the principles and methods of engineering and life sciences towards the development of biological substitutes to restore, maintain or improve functions. The relevant document 'Tissue engineering in the USA' mentions examples of applications such as artificial skin and reconstitution of a blood vessel in culture. None of these options seem directly related to these examples. Option A is not mentioned in any of the documents, option B seems unrelated to tissue engineering, option C is an example of biomaterial used in oral surgery but it's not directly related to active tissue engineering, option D is also an example of biomaterial used as a scaffold for tissue regeneration. Therefore, based on the provided information, I conclude that none of these options are included in active tissue engineering.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"None of the above\""]
