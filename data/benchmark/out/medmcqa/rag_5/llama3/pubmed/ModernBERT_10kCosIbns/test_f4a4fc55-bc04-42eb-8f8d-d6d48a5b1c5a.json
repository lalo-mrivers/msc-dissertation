["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the strains that make up a trivalent influenza vaccine. The documents provided describe various recombinant strains such as Alice, RIT 4025 and RIT 4050, but none of these specific strains are mentioned in relation to a trivalent vaccine. However, it is mentioned that changes in surface antigens make preparation of an effective vaccine against the influenza virus a difficult job, and improvements in purification processes have lessened the incidence and severity of reactions. This suggests that the vaccine may contain multiple strains. Given this information, we can look at the potential choices provided. Option A: H1N1 is mentioned as a specific strain, but it is not clear if it refers to a trivalent or monovalent vaccine. Options B and C refer to specific subtypes of influenza A virus, which could be part of a trivalent vaccine. Option D refers to Influenza B virus, which is also mentioned in the documents as being included in some vaccines. Therefore, based on the information provided, it seems most likely that the correct answer is not mentioned explicitly.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
