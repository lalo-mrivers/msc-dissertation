["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the given documents, we can see that double outlet left ventricle with intact ventricular septum is a congenital heart defect. Since the patient presents with central cyanosis and left ventricular hypertrophy, it's likely related to a cyanotic heart disease. Tetrology of Fallot (C) is known for its association with cyanosis and could cause left ventricular hypertrophy. Tricuspid atresia (A) might also cause cyanosis but doesn't typically lead to left ventricular hypertrophy. Eisenmenger syndrome (B) is a complication of atrial septal defect, which isn't mentioned in the patient's description. Total anomalous pulmonary venous drainage (D) can cause cyanosis, but it would more likely affect right ventricular function rather than leading to left ventricular hypertrophy.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
