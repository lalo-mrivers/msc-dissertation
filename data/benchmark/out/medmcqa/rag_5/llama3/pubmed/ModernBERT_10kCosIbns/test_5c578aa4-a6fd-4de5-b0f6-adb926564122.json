["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents discuss the classification of causes and circumstances of death, medical malpractice, and legal aspects related to death. The documents also mention police procedures for unnatural deaths and the need for compulsory notification of signs of unnatural death. The question asks about embalming without issuing a death certificate being punishable under which section. Since embalming is a procedure usually performed after death, it suggests that the act in question is not providing a death certificate despite the person being deceased. Therefore, we can infer that this act is considered unnatural death. This is supported by the document [Medical and legal problems of multiple death certificates] where it is mentioned that for legal purposes it is not possible to induce another doctor to issue another death certificate with the manner of death certified as natural.\n\nBased on this analysis, we can conclude that the section under which embalming without issuing a death certificate is punishable is related to unnatural death. This leads us to examine the Indian Penal Code (IPC) sections related to unnatural death. IPC 297 deals with causing the disappearance of evidence of the body of a person who has died if that person came to his death under such circumstances as to render it justifiable for any person to cause that disappearance. However, this section does not directly relate to embalming without issuing a death certificate.\n\nOn the other hand, IPC 299 deals with causing a person's death by an act amounting to culpable homicide. This section could be relevant if the embalming procedure caused the person's death or was done in such a way that it contributed to their death.\n\nHowever, IPC 201 is not related to unnatural death or embalming procedures. Similarly, IPC 498 is a section dealing with cruelty by husband or his relatives and does not relate to embalming or death certificate issues.\n\nIn conclusion, the most likely answer is C: IPC 299.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
