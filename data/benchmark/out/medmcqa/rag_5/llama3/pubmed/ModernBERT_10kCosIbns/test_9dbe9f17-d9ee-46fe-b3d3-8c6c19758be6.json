["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Since the question is about comparing postpartum depression scores between mothers giving birth to male versus female children, we need a test that compares two groups. We are looking for a categorical variable (male/female) and a continuous outcome measure (postpartum depression scores). This suggests we should use an unpaired test as there is no pairing of the data points. The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) is a continuous outcome measure, so we need to use a test that compares means. We also know that one variable is categorical and one is continuous, which further supports the choice of an unpaired test.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
