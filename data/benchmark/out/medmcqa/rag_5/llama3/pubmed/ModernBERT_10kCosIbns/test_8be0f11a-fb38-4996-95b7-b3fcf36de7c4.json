["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks for a disease that is NOT transmitted by an infectious agent. The provided documents discuss epidemiology of communicable diseases, animal epidemics, virus infection, and pathogenicity. We can infer from the context that infectious agents are microorganisms or biological substances that cause infection. Based on this understanding, we need to identify which option does not involve transmission of a disease by an infectious agent.\n\nUpon reviewing the options, we notice that Kala Azar is caused by Leishmania donovani, Chandipura encephalitis is caused by Alphavirus, Babesiosis is caused by Babesia microti, and Carrion's Disease is caused by Bartonella bacilliformis. All these diseases are transmitted by infectious agents.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that the answer is not among the provided options. This is because the question asks for a disease that is NOT transmitted by an infectious agent, which means it should be a non-infectious condition or a disease caused by other factors rather than an infectious agent.\", \"answer_choice\": null}"]
