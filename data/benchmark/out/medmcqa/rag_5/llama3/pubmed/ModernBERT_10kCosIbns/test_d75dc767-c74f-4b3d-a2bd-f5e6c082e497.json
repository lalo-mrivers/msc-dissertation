Supracondylar fractures can cause nerve injuries, specifically ulnar nerve palsy is mentioned in one of the case reports. Furthermore, the document on metacarpophalangeal and proximal interphalangeal joint injuries states that the median nerve controls flexion at the metacarpophalangeal and interphalangeal joints. However, since the patient has difficulty with thumb movement, which is primarily controlled by the thenar muscles innervated by the median nerve, it's unlikely that the injury is caused by a median nerve palsy.
