["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about improving the quality of casts with addition silicones. The relevant documents mention the porosity of automixed silicone elastomers, the safety and effectiveness of medical-grade liquid silicone, and the properties of silicone rubber after implantation or injection. There is no specific information provided on how to improve cast quality. However, one document mentions that 'certain automixed materials were better than others', implying that the type of material used can affect the outcome. Therefore, it seems reasonable to consider the choice options related to the material used in the casting process.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
