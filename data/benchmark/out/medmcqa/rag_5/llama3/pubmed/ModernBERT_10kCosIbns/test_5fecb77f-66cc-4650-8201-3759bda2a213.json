["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the steady-state plasma concentration of drug X. The half-life (t1/2) is given as 1.8 hours, which means the elimination rate constant (λ) can be calculated using the formula λ = ln(2)/t1/2. Then, we need to find the volume of distribution (Vd) from the clearance (Cl) and λ. Finally, we can use the formula Css = Dose/Cl*Vd/([AUC0-inf] - [AUMC0-inf]/[τ]), where Css is the steady-state plasma concentration, Dose is the rate of infusion (1.6 mg/min), τ is the half-life (1.8 hours) and AUMC0-inf is the area under the moment curve from 0 to infinity.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
