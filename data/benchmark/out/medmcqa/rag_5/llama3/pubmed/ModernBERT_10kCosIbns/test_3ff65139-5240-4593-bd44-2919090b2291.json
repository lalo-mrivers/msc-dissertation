["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The Chi-square test is a statistical measure used to determine whether there is a significant association between two categorical variables. It's often misused when the data is paired or involves small sample sizes. The documents highlight the incorrect use of Chi-square analysis for paired data and recommend Fisher's Exact Test instead.
