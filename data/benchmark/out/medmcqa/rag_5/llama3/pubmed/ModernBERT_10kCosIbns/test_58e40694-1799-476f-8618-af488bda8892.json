["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 2-week-old infant who developed conjunctivitis that progressed to respiratory distress and pneumonia. Chest X-ray shows bilateral lung infiltrates. The WBC count was 14,300/dL. Considering the age of the patient, it's likely that the infection is caused by a viral or bacterial agent that commonly affects young infants.
