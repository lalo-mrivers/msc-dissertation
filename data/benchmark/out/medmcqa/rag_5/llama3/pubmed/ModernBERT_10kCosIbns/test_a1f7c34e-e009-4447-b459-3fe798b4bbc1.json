["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Right trochlear nerve palsy affects the superior oblique muscle which is responsible for downward gaze. Therefore, diplopia on upward gaze and adduction are possible symptoms (refer to [Combined trochlear nerve palsy and internuclear ophthalmoplegia] where a right superior oblique palsy was associated with a right internuclear ophthalmoplegia). Head tilt is not a direct result of trochlear nerve palsy. Exotropia refers to an outward deviation of the eye, which is not typically caused by trochlear nerve palsy (refer to [Lateralis splitting\" in total oculomotor paralysis with trochlear nerve paralysis] where the procedure aimed to correct horizontal deviation). Hyperopia is a type of refractive error and is not directly related to trochlear nerve palsy.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
