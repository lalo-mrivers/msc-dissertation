["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the histopathological features of basal cell carcinoma (BCC). We can find descriptions of BCC morphology in 'Growth of human basal cell carcinomas transplanted to C57/Balb/C bgJ/bgJ nu/nu mice', 'An electron-microscopic study of basal cell carcinoma', and 'The epidermal basement membrane in basal cell carcinoma: an immunohistochemical study'.
