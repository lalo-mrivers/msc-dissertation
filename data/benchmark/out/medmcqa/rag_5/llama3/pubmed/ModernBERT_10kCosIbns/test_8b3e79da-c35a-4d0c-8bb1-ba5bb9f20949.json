["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking which option is not a technique for protein precipitation. From the provided documents, we can see that techniques mentioned are related to chromatography, electrophoresis, and extraction/purification of proteins. Trichloroacetic acid is not explicitly mentioned as a technique for protein precipitation, but it is sometimes used as a precipitant in protein isolation. Heat precipitation is a common method used to precipitate proteins. Isoelectric point method is also used to separate proteins based on their charge. Titration with reducing sugar does not seem to be related to protein precipitation or purification techniques.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D: Titration with reducing sugar, as it is not a technique for protein precipitation.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
