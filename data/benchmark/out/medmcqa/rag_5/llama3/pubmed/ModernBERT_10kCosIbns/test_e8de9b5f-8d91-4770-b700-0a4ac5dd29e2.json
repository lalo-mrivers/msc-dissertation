["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the toxin causing a specific condition. The provided documents discuss acute poisoning cases, toxic deaths, experimental endotoxic shock, avian toxicology, and enzymatic tests in acute poisonings. None of these documents mention botulism, tetanus, or diphtheria. They do mention cardiac drugs like tricyclic antidepressants, digitalis, and ajmaline, as well as domestic products and other chemicals. Since the question does not provide any specific information about the toxin, it's best to rely on the most common causes of toxic deaths mentioned in the 'Death from acute poisoning in man' document. Cardiotropic drugs like tricyclic antidepressants, digitalis, and ajmaline are more likely candidates.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
