["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the zone of stimulation. The relevant documents describe various types of stimulation, including afferent stimulation of somatic nerves, regional electric stimulation of sympathetic ganglia, and percutaneous electrical stimulation of sensory nerves.
