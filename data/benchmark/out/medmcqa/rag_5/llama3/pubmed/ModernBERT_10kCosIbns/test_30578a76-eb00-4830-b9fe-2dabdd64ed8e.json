["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to the document 'Genetic counselling and genetics of cleft lip and cleft palate', the inheritance of cleft lip and palate is usually multifactorial. With normal parents, the risk of having a first affected child with cleft lip is about one per thousand, the risk of having a second affected child 4 per cent and the risk of having a third affected child 10 per cent. If a parent has already a cleft lip, the risk of having a first affected child now is 4 per cent, while the risk of having a second affected child is 10 per cent. This suggests that multiple genetic and environmental factors contribute to the development of cleft lip and palate.\", \"answer_choice\": C}"]
