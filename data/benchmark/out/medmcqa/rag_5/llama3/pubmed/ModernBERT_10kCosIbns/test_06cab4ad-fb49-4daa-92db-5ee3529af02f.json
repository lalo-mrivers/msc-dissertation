["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Stress trajectories within the mandible under occlusal loads suggests that the condyle is a stress-bearing structure. This implies that the movement of the mandible is affected by the forces applied to it. The human mandible: lever, link, or both? states that the mandible probably functions simultaneously as both lever and link during incisal biting. A modified sagittal step osteotomy of the mandibular body mentions elongation and rotation of its anterior part without bone grafting, which implies movement of the mandible. Therefore, retractions of the mandible are related to forces applied to it.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
