["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the type of failure that may occur if the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) of ceramic is much lower than that of metal. Since the CTE of ceramic is lower, it means that ceramic expands less with temperature change compared to metal. This mismatch in thermal expansion can cause stress at the ceramic-metal interface. As a result, cohesive failure of metal ceramic bond (D) is more likely to occur.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
