["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The provided documents describe the structure of human epidermis. From the surface to deep layers, we have: stratum corneum (horny cells), stratum granulosum, stratum spinosum, and finally, the basal layer. Corneocytes are dead keratinocytes that form the outermost layer, while Merkel cells are found in the stratum spinosum. Melanocytes are present throughout the epidermis, but mostly in the basal layers. Langerhans cells are also found in the basal layers. Therefore, we can arrange the layers from surface to deep as follows: Corneocytes > Merkel cells > Melanocytes > Langerhans cells.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
