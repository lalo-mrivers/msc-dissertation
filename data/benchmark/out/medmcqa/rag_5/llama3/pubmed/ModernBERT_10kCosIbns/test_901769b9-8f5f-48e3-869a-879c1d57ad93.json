["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the provided documents, we can see that ultrasound scanning is a common method for prenatal diagnosis. The document 'Ultrasound diagnosis of fetal abnormalities in multiple pregnancy' mentions that ultrasound was used to diagnose abnormal multiple pregnancies successfully over a period of four years. This includes rare combinations of abnormalities, such as synchronous blighted ovum and missed abortion. Another document, 'Ultrasound evidence of early pregnancy failure in patients with multiple conceptions', reports a review of 1500 pregnant patients and mentions that 30 of them (or 1 in 50) were thought to have multiple pregnancies when examined by ultrasound in the first trimester.\n\nBased on these documents, we can see that abnormalities can be diagnosed in the first trimester using ultrasound scanning. The document 'Medical disorders in pregnancy' does not specifically mention the diagnosis of abnormalities in the first trimester, but it mentions the use of real-time ultrasound rather than venography to diagnose deep vein thrombosis in pregnancy.\n\nThe document 'Prenatal biochemical screening' discusses biochemical screening for chromosomal abnormalities and neutral tube defects, but does not specifically mention the diagnosis of abnormalities in the first trimester.\n\nBased on this information, we can conclude that some abnormalities can be diagnosed in the first trimester using ultrasound scanning. The specific abnormality mentioned is anencephaly, which is a rare condition characterized by the absence of most of the brain and skull.\", \n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
