["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the most useful parameter according to WHO for assessing adequacy of sperms for fertilization. According to the provided documents, there is no mention of 'Spermatocyte count' or 'Semen volume' as a relevant parameter in any of the studies presented. The study on routine intrauterine insemination and spermatozoal washing mentions spermatozoal velocity and post-wash spermatozoal concentration as parameters that changed significantly between conceptual and non-conceptual cycles, but it does not specify which one is more important or useful for assessing adequacy of sperms for fertilization. The study on spermiophages in human semen does not provide any information about the most useful parameter for assessing adequacy of sperms for fertilization either.\n\nHowever, the document 'Towards the definition of the fertilizing spermatozoa' suggests that the laboratory contributions have focused on the development of more refined techniques concerning the functional competence of human spermatozoa, including computerized study of sperm motility. This implies that sperm motility might be an important parameter in assessing adequacy of sperms for fertilization.\n\nFinally, the document 'Artificial insemination for oligospermia' mentions that a minimum of 1 M motile capacitated spermatozoa is required for intrauterine insemination to be successful. This suggests that sperm motility and capacitation might be important parameters in assessing adequacy of sperms for fertilization.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the information provided, it seems that sperm motility might be the most useful parameter according to WHO for assessing adequacy of sperms for fertilization.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
