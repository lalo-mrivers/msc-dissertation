["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is morbidly obese and has a history of pancreatitis, which suggests that she may be at risk for developing insulin-related problems. She also has a family history of bladder cancer, but this is not directly relevant to her diabetes treatment options. Since the patient does not want to take injections, we need to focus on oral medications. Metformin was previously tried and failed, so we should consider alternative medications that work differently.\n\nPhenformin is mentioned in one of the documents as having no significant effect on insulin secretion, but it could be considered as an option since the patient does not want to take injections.\n\nHowever, based on the available information, phenformin is not a good choice for this patient. Instead, we should focus on medications that do not primarily work through increasing insulin secretion.\n\nCanagliflozin and pioglitazone are both options that could be suitable for this patient. Canagliflozin works by inhibiting sodium-glucose cotransporters, which can help reduce glucose levels in the body. Pioglitazone is a thiazolidinedione that helps improve insulin sensitivity.\n\nLiraglutide and sitagliptin are both medications that primarily work through increasing insulin secretion, which may not be suitable for this patient given her history of pancreatitis.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: Pioglitazone\""]
