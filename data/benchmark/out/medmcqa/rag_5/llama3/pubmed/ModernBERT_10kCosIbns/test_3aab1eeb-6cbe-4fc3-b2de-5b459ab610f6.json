["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about acceptable investigations at day 3 of presentation for a suspected patient of dengue. The given documents provide information about various diagnostic tests used for dengue virus infections. Specifically, the document 'Dengue with haemorrhage and shock in Jakarta, Indonesia' mentions that all four types of dengue viruses were isolated using the C6/36 cell line. This suggests that viral culture and isolation in the C6/36 cell line is a feasible investigation for dengue virus infection.\n\nThe document 'Imported dengue--United States, 1991' does not provide information on specific investigations used to diagnose dengue cases.\n\nThe documents 'Epidemic dengue hemorrhagic fever in rural Indonesia. II. Clinical studies' and 'Infections with two dengue viruses in Greece in the 20th century' do not mention ELISA for antibody against dengue virus or NS I antigen detection as diagnostic tests used to diagnose dengue cases.\n\nTherefore, based on the available information, all of these are acceptable investigations at day 3 of presentation except #NAME?, which is not a valid investigation.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
