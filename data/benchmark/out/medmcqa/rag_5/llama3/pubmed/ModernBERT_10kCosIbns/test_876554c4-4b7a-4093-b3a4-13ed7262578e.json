["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has osteomalacia with hypocalcemia, which is described as a recognized cause of cardiac failure. The question asks about the metabolic condition that has phosphaturia and osteomalacia. Phosphaturia is mentioned in the 'The Osteomalacias' document as one of the main biochemical parameters in osteomalacia, along with defective calcium absorption with hypocalcemia. This suggests that the metabolic condition causing osteomalacia is likely related to calcium or phosphate metabolism. Given this information and the patient's symptoms, it is likely that the metabolic condition causing phosphaturia and osteomalacia is nutritional osteomalacia due to inadequate exposure to sunlight and/or insufficient vitamin D intake.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
