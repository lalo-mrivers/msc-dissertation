["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about high copper silver alloy compared to conventional alloy. The relevant documents are The effect of added particles on the properties of Ag3 Sn-additive amalgams, The strength of fifteen amalgam alloys, and none of the other documents directly discuss high copper silver alloy. However, we can use our knowledge from these documents to make an educated guess. The strength of fifteen amalgam alloys states that 'Alloys of the single melt high copper type generally possess the greatest strength at all times of testing.' This suggests that high copper silver alloy may have increased tensile and compressive strength compared to conventional alloy. Additionally, there is no mention of poor tarnish or corrosion resistance being a characteristic of high copper silver alloy.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
