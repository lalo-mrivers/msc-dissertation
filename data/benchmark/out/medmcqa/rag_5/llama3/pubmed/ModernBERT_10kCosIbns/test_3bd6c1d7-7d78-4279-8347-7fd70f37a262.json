["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the trigger for myosin head detachment from actin. The relevant document is 'Crossbridge states in isometrically contracting fish muscle: evidence for swinging of myosin heads on actin'. In this document, it is mentioned that the likely crossbridge configurations include a non-force producing 'weak-binding' state and a force-producing attached state. The paper suggests that the myosin heads bind to the actin filaments in a non-specific manner in the weak-binding state, but swing as fairly rigid structures on actin during contraction. This implies that myosin head detachment from actin is not triggered by a change in troponin c configuration or entry of Ca into sarcoplasmic reticulum. Instead, it seems that myosin head detachment may be related to the hydrolysis of ATP to ADP and Pi.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
