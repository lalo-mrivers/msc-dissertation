["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents provided discuss various aspects of lichen planus, including immunohistochemistry, enzyme changes, long-term follow-up, epidermal changes, and studies on oral lichen planus. To answer this question, I will focus on the histopathologic study of lichen planus. The documents suggest that there is a thickened granular layer in the transitional zone, with a reduction in acid phosphatase reaction intensity. This finding is consistent with epidermal changes described in one of the documents, which included irregular folding or dislocation of the basal lamina and fragmentation with degenerative changes of basal keratinocytes. These findings support the view that the primary event in LP represents an injury involving epidermal basal cells.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
