["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The degradation of very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) by extrahepatic tissues of the rat suggests that VLDL is degraded to LDL in these tissues. The binding of human lipoprotein lipase-treated VLDL by HepG2 cells also suggests that VLDL is concerned with delivery of cholesterol to extrahepatic tissue, as well as the presence of an apo E or remnant receptor on HepG2 cells which binds VLDL remnants.\n\nThe characterization of liver-enriched proteins binding to a developmentally demethylated site flanking the avian apoVLDLII gene suggests that this protein interacts with the upstream apoVLDLII site, and its expression is increased in proliferating cells. This indicates that VLDL may be concerned with delivery of cholesterol to extrahepatic tissue.\n\nThe characterization of the low-density-lipoprotein-receptor-independent interaction of beta-very-low-density lipoprotein with rat and human parenchymal liver cells in vitro suggests that VLDL is concerned with delivery of cholesterol to extrahepatic tissue, as beta-VLDL is a cholesteryl-ester-enriched lipoprotein which under normal conditions is rapidly cleared by parenchymal liver cells.\n\nOptimal design of experiments to estimate LDL transport parameters in arterial wall also suggests that VLDL is concerned with delivery of cholesterol to extrahepatic tissue, as the arterial wall is often exposed to labeled lipoproteins and the LDL receptor-independent recognition site for beta-VLDL may mediate in vivo the uptake of beta-VLDL during consumption of a cholesterol-rich diet, when LDL receptors are down-regulated.\n\nIn conclusion, VLDL is concerned with delivery of cholesterol to extrahepatic tissue.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
