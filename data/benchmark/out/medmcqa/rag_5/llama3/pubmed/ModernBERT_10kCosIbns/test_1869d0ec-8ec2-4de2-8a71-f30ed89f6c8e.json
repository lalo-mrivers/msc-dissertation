["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant document is 'Correlation between benzodiazepine receptor occupation and anticonvulsant effects of diazepam'. It talks about the binding sites for benzodiazepines in the central nervous system. This suggests that there are specific receptors for benzodiazepines, which can be occupied by these compounds to produce their effects. The study also mentions labelling benzodiazepine receptors in vivo and correlating it with anticonvulsant activity. From this information, we can infer that a benzodiazepine antagonist would bind to these receptors, preventing the occupation of sites by benzodiazepines.\",\n\"answer_choice\": A"]
