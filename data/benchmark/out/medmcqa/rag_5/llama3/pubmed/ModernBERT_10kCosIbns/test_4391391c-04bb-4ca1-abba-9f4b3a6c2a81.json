["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 76-year-old female presenting with a non-healing ulcer on the labia majora for 6 months. The biopsy shows squamous cell carcinoma. We can consider the relevant documents to determine the management options.\n\nSquamous cell carcinoma of the vulva: prognostic factors influencing survival (1975-1988) suggests that radical surgery is effective in treating this disease, and advanced-stage disease with regional metastases significantly alters survival.\n\nSquamous carcinoma of the vulva: results of treatment (1938-1976) indicates that patients treated with radical vulvectomy and bilateral lymphadenectomy had a corrected 5-year survival rate of 86% if the lymph nodes failed to show metastatic disease. The presence of lymphatic metastasis appeared to be the most significant prognostic factor.\n\nOutcome, complications, and follow-up in surgically treated squamous cell carcinoma of the vulva (1956-1982) suggests that radical vulvectomy and inguinal lymph-node dissection had a 5-year survival rate of 64% for stage III cases. The fact that patients who underwent only vulvar operation had significantly less late complications suggests that the patient's age and comorbidities may influence treatment options.\n\nConsidering these documents, we can conclude that radical surgery is effective in treating squamous cell carcinoma of the vulva, and the patient's age (76 years) and absence of palpable lymphadenopathy suggest that a more conservative approach may be appropriate.\n\nThe patient's lesion size (2 x 3 cm) is relatively small, which suggests that wide excision or simple vulvectomy may be sufficient. However, considering the presence of regional metastases and the risk of recurrence, sentinel LN biopsy may also be considered to determine the status of lymph nodes.\n\nTherefore, management options for this patient include radical vulvectomy with sentinel LN biopsy, wide excision, or simple vulvectomy.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A: Radical vulvectomy with sentinal LN biopsy\""]
