["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"No relevant information is provided regarding cephalometric analysis or growth changes. The documents discuss topics such as computer simulation of bidimensional growth of a fern gametophyte, white noise analysis of Phycomyces light growth response system, and the kinetics of mycelial growth. Therefore, it cannot be determined which plane (Sella-Nasion, Mandibular, FHP, or Occlusal) is used to evaluate growth changes.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A: Sella - Nasion plane\"\n}"]
