["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks when mean and standard deviation can be worked out. According to the theory of reference values, it is mentioned that standard deviations are widely used measures of precision. In one of the documents, it states 'the conventional population-based normal range has recently been shown to be a generally defective reference criterion for assessing individual laboratory test results.' This implies that mean and standard deviation can be calculated when data is on a scale that allows for comparison and quantification, which would be an interval or ratio scale.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
