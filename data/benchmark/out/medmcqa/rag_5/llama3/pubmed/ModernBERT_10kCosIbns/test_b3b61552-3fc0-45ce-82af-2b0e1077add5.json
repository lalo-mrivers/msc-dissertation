["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents discuss miniplates used for mandibular fractures. The first document describes the treatment of 31 mandibular angle fractures using two mini dynamic compression plates with self-threading screws placed through a transoral incision with transbuccal trochar instrumentation. None of the patients were placed into postsurgical maxillomandibular fixation (MMF) or training elastics, indicating that the use of miniplates in this study was non-rigid osteosynthesis. The second document is an in vitro study testing the stability of miniplate osteosynthesis in the mandible and confirms that single plate fixation may not provide sufficient resistance to bending and torsional forces, especially in cases of jaw angle fracture. This suggests a load-sharing or load-bearing approach rather than rigid fixation. The third document describes computer-aided optimization of choice and positioning of bone plates and screws used for internal fixation of mandibular fractures, which also supports the idea that miniplates may not provide sufficient rigidity to immobilize the mandible.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
