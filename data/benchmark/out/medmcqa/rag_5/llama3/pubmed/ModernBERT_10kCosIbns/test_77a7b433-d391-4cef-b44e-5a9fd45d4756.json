["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the adult stage of filarial worms responsible for diseases. According to the provided documents, Brugia malayi is found in wild and domestic carnivores and monkeys, and can develop to maturity with microfilaraemia and clinical manifestations in man similar to those caused by periodic B. malayi in man. Similarly, Wuchereria bancrofti is a subperiodic strain of Brugia malayi that develops to maturity with the production of microfilaraemia and clinical manifestations in man. On the other hand, Dirofilaria species (D. immitis, D. repens, and D. tenuis) cause pulmonary dirofilariasis and subcutaneous nodules in man, but do not mature and rarely give rise to microfilaraemia. Mansonella ozzardi is not mentioned as a disease-causing filarial worm in the provided documents. Therefore, it can be concluded that adult stage of Dirofilaria species (D. immitis, D. repens, and D. tenuis) are responsible for diseases in all except one option.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
