["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the variation that involves 99.73%. This information can be found in the 'Haematological values of Udah and Yankasa sheep in the Northern Guinea savanna of Nigeria' document, which provides information on haematological values from healthy flocks. The document states that these values could serve as a baseline for interpreting haematological data from diseased local sheep. Since we are looking for the variation that involves 99.73%, it is likely related to the normal distribution and standard deviation. According to the bell-curve principle, approximately 68% of data points fall within one standard deviation (SD) of the mean, while around 95% of data points fall within two SDs of the mean. Therefore, the variation that involves 99.73% would be three SDs.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
