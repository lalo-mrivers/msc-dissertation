["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the property of amalgam that makes it undesirable to bevel occlusal margins. The relevant documents suggest that marginal adaptation and retention are important for amalgam restorations. In the 'Scanning electron microscope study of marginal adaptation of amalgam in restoration finishing techniques' document, it is mentioned that the burnished surface has an improved marginal adaptation compared to carved and polished surfaces. This implies that a beveled occlusal margin may compromise the marginal adaptation. Therefore, it can be inferred that the property making it undesirable to bevel occlusal margins is the fact that amalgam restoration requires a smooth surface for proper marginal adaptation.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
