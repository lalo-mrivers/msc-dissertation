["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the phenomenon of vasomotor reversal of Dale. The relevant documents describe various experiments on animals. From these descriptions, we can infer that the vasomotor reversal of Dale refers to the reversal of adrenergic failure. In an animal model, this phenomenon can be demonstrated by evaluating the effects of progressive adrenergic failure and its restoration. This is done by assessing changes in heart rate recordings, blood pressure, and baroreflex gain. The relevant document states that late phase II and phase IV are primary regulated by peripheral and cardiac sympathetic activity, respectively. With progressive adrenergic failure there is a loss of III, an increase in IIE and a loss of IV in that order.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C: Stimulation of alpha-1 followed by block of beta-2\""]
