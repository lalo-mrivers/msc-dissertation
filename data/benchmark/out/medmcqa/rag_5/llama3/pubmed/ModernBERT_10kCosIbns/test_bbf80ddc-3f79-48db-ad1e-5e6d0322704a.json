["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe Kawasaki disease as an acute febrile malady of childhood. The main clinical presentations are prolonged fever, conjunctivitis, lesions of the oral and pharyngeal mucosa, inflammatory reddening and swelling of the hands and feet, skin rash and cervical lymph node enlargement. Laboratory data show an inflammatory syndrome and thrombocytosis. The disease usually resolves within a few weeks. The major risk is cardiovascular involvement with pericarditis, myocarditis and, chiefly, coronary artery aneurysms which usually regress but are the main cause of mortality (1 to 2 p. 100 of the cases). Treatment consists of gammaglobulins and aspirin in high doses; when administered at an early stage, it prevents the formation of coronary aneurysms.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C\n}"]
