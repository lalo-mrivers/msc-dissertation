["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the total number of vertebrae present in the vertebral column. The provided documents do not directly answer this question. However, we can use the information from 'The number of vertebrae in the Southern African Negro, the American Negro and the Bushman (San)' to estimate the range of possible answers. According to this document, males have a significantly greater frequency of increased PCV (precoccygeal vertebra) up to 30 or 31, whereas females are more likely to have a decreased number of 28 PCV. This suggests that the total number of vertebrae may be higher in males and lower in females. The other documents do not provide direct information on the total number of vertebrae.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
