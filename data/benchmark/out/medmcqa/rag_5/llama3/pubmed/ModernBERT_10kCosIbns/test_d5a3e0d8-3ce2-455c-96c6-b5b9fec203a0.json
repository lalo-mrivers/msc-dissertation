["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"There is no direct relation between the given documents and the question about borders of major connectors adjacent to gingival crevices. The documents are related to various topics such as free autogenous graft procedures, wound-healing studies, epithelial-mesenchymal interactions, implant soft tissue interface, remodeling of human gingival tissues following gingivectomy, and alteration of lingual mucosa with free gingival grafts. However, we can look for any information that might be related to the depth or distance between a connector and a crevice. In one of the documents, it is mentioned that after gingivectomy, the newly formed free gingival margin was located coronally to the line of incision in all cases, with a mean gain in coronal marginal height of 1.2 mm +/- 0.3 mm. This information suggests that the gingival crevice can close by up to 1.2 mm during the healing phase. Therefore, we can infer that the borders of major connectors should be no closer than 1-2 mm from the crevice.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
