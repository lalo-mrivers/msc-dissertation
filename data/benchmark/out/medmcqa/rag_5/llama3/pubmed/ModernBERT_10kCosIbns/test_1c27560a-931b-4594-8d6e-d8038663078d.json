["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the Direct Coombs test being positive in all cases except one. Since there are no relevant documents provided that discuss the Direct Coombs test being used for aplastic anemia or drug-induced AIHA, I can eliminate options C and D. This leaves us with options A and B, both of which mention hemolytic anemia due to transfusion. The Vienna 1949-1979 study discusses a positive direct Coombs-reaction in patients with autoimmune hemolytic anemia, which is often caused by transfusions. Therefore, I can conclude that the correct answer is likely one of the options related to hemolytic anemia.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
