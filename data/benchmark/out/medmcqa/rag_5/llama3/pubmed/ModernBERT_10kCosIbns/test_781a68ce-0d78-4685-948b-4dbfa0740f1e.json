["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the documents, we can see that Diethylstilboestrol (DES) has been shown to cause various dysplasias and tumours in experimental animals. In the context of this question, we are considering the effects on a child born to a mother exposed to DES during pregnancy.\\nIn the document 'Induction of urogenital anomalies and some tumors in the progeny of mice receiving diethylstilbestrol during pregnancy', we see that prenatal exposure to DES can cause vaginal adenosis, testicular hypoplasia, cryptorchidism, urethrovaginal cloaca, penile and testicular hypoplasia.\\nIn the document 'Genital tract anomalies associated with in utero exposure to diethylstilbestrol', we see that women exposed in utero to DES can have vaginal epithelial changes, gross anatomic changes of the cervix and uterus.\\nFrom these documents, it seems that DES can cause a range of urogenital tract abnormalities in offspring. Among these options, the one that is not described as being caused by prenatal exposure to DES is:\\nB: Microglandular hyperplasia\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
