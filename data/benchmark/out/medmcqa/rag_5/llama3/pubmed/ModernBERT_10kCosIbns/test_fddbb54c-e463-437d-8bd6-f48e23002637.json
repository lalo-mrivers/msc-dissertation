["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"There is no relevant information about epidermal cysts of the maxilla or calcifying odontogenic cysts. The question is asking about a symmetric, expansile cystic lesion in the proximal humerus which is mentioned in Osteochondroma of humerus in focal dermal hypoplasia (Goltz) syndrome. The patient has a similar condition as described in this document. Based on the available information, we can see that osteochondromas are benign bone tumors and surgical excision is usually the treatment of choice for these lesions. Therefore, the options related to medical therapy such as intralesional steroids or sclerosing agents do not seem relevant. Radiotherapy is also not a suitable option for treating an expansile cystic lesion in the proximal humerus. Curettage can be done but it's not the most effective treatment approach for this type of lesion.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
