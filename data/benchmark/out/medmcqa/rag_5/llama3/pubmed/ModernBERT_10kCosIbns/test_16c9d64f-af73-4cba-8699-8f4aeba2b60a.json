["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about an infant with a history of vomiting and malnutrition, Guthrie test positive. The patient has blue eyes, blonde hair & fair skin. Based on the given documents, it is clear that this is a case of phenylketonuria (PKU). PKU is caused by a deficiency of the enzyme PAH in the body's ability to break down the amino acid phenylalanine. This leads to an accumulation of toxic levels of phenylalanine and its metabolites, causing symptoms such as vomiting and malnutrition.\n\nThe Guthrie test is used to detect the presence of phenylalanine in the blood, which is indicative of PKU.\n\nThe patient's physical characteristics (blue eyes, blonde hair & fair skin) are not relevant to the diagnosis.\n\nMental retardation is a known complication of untreated PKU, but this is not a definitive characteristic.\n\nPhenyl acetate is not mentioned as a test result in any of the provided documents, so it cannot be used to diagnose or rule out PKU. Therefore, option C is incorrect.\n\nThe other options are all related to PKU, and one of them must be false. Since B is not mentioned in the provided documents, it is likely that this option refers to a different disease, making it the correct answer.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
