["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Since the question is about the Periodontal Ligament (PDL), we need to find information about the PDL's response to tooth tipping. In the document 'Electron microscopical evaluation of connective tissue healing to periodontally involved teeth', it discusses the root treatment for human periodontally involved teeth and how it can facilitate a new connective tissue attachment. The document explains that the fibroblasts synthesized new fibrillar materials and collagen fibrils towards the curetted cementum. This suggests that the PDL fibers respond to tooth tipping by being stretched, as they adapt to the changed position of the tooth.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B: All stretched\"\n}"]
