["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about a patient who underwent thyroidectomy for hyperthyroidism but then presented with features of thyroid storm two days later. The documents provided discuss various aspects of thyroid function and treatment, including thyrotoxicosis, painless subacute thyroiditis, and subtotal thyroidectomy for hyperthyroidism in children. Given the timing of the patient's presentation with thyroid storm, it is unlikely that poor antibiotic coverage or rough handling during surgery are relevant factors. The removal of parathyroid tissue is not a likely cause of thyroid storm either, as this would result in hypoparathyroidism rather than hyperthyroidism. Therefore, the most likely cause of the patient's presentation with thyroid storm after thyroidectomy is inadequate preoperative preparation.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
