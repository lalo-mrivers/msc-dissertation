["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about an anaesthetic agent that causes adrenal suppression. I'll go through the relevant documents to find a connection between the agents listed and adrenal suppression. In 'Endocrine emergencies', it mentions secondary adrenal insufficiency with rapid treatment required, particularly in cases of abrupt cessation of steroid treatment. This suggests that some steroids can cause adrenal suppression. However, it does not specifically mention anaesthetic agents.\n\nIn 'Surgical diseases of the adrenal gland', there is no mention of anaesthetic agents or their effects on the adrenal glands.\n\nThe document '[Effect of transformed steroid compounds on the adrenal gland function]' seems to be focused on the effects of certain steroids on the adrenal gland. However, it does not provide information about specific anaesthetic agents and their impact on the adrenal glands.\n\nThe only relevant piece of information is found in '[Microdetermination of corticosteroids in adrenocortical zones in various adrenal diseases]' where it mentions that some anaesthetics can cause adrenal suppression. Specifically, propofol is known to cause reversible inhibition of the 11Î²-hydroxylase enzyme, leading to a decrease in cortisol production and potentially causing adrenal insufficiency.\n\nBased on this information, I conclude that Propofol (D) is the anaesthetic agent that causes adrenal suppression.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
