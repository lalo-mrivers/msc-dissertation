["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The SI unit of X-ray is discussed in the provided documents. In the first document, it mentions that the instrument measures dose rates from 2500 rad min-1 at 10 kV to 50 rad min-1 at 250 kV. This suggests that Rad is a relevant unit for measuring X-ray doses. The second and third documents do not provide specific information about SI units of X-ray, but they do discuss various aspects of X-ray physics and technology. The fourth document does not mention X-ray units. Therefore, it can be concluded that the most relevant and accurate answer is A: Rad.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
