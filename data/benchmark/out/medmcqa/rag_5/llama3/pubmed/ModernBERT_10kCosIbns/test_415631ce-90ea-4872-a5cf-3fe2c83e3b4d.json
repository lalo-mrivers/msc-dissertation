["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about viral diarrhoea in adults. Based on the provided documents, I can see that there are several studies on enteric pathogens, but none of them specifically focus on viral causes of diarrhoea in adults. However, one study does mention the presence of 'fatty globules' characteristic of an infectious condition called 'fatty diarrhoea' which was frequently observed by microscopy in stools from young children and occasionally from older persons. This suggests that there may be some unidentified viral or parasitic agents involved in undiagnosed diarrheas.\n\nUpon reviewing the potential choices, I notice that option D, Norovirus, is not mentioned in any of the provided documents. Options A, B, and C are all types of viruses that can cause gastrointestinal symptoms, but none of them are specifically linked to shellfish or foodborne illnesses.\n\nConsidering the patient's history of eating shellfish from a local restaurant and the similar symptoms experienced by others who had food from the same restaurant, I suspect that the most common cause of viral diarrhoea in adults is Norovirus. However, this is not explicitly stated in any of the provided documents.\n\nTherefore, based on my analysis, I will choose option D: Norovirus as the most common cause of viral diarrhoea in adults.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
