["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the document 'Three-dimensional observations of accessory canals in mature and developing rat molar teeth', we know that accessory canals typically appear in the gaps or slits formed by the epithelial root sheaths. They usually connect the periodontal ligament to the dental pulp with one blood vessel, but sometimes they are broken off midway following the destruction of the vessels. Since this document focuses on rat molar teeth and does not provide specific information about mandibular molars, we need to look for similar information in other documents.\n\nIn the document 'Anatomical relationship of the mandibular canal to its surrounding structures in mature mandibles', we do not find any direct information about accessory canals or their formation. However, we learn that the mandibular canal follows an S-shaped curve in 31% of the cases and is located lingual (19%), buccal (17%), or directly inferior (5%) to the apices of the posterior teeth.\n\nIn the document 'Root canal configuration of the mandibular first premolar', we find that C-shaped canals are associated with Type IV canal systems, which occur in 14% of the roots. This suggests that the occurrence of accessory canals might be related to the complexity of the root canal system.\n\nGiven this information, we need to look for documents discussing the formation and distribution of accessory canals in mandibular molars. Unfortunately, none of the provided documents provide direct answers about the frequency of single accessory canals arising from the coronal 1/3rd in mandibular molars.\n\nBased on our analysis of the available documents, we can deduce that the information needed is not present in any of the provided texts.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
