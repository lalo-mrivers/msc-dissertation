["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents reveal that serum mitochondrial glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase activity is studied in patients with liver diseases, and its values are higher in acute hepatitis (100 units or thereabout) and alcoholic hepatitis (50-60 units). In contrast, the values are lower in chronic hepatitis (20-30 units), liver cirrhosis, and post-transfusion hepatitis. The document also mentions that one patient with fulminant hepatitis showed an extremely high value of 295 mU. Furthermore, it is mentioned that one patient with fresh myocardial infarction showed an extremely high value of 110 mU. Based on this information, we can deduce that the enzyme is higher in liver diseases and also in cardiovascular conditions like myocardial infarction.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C\n}"]
