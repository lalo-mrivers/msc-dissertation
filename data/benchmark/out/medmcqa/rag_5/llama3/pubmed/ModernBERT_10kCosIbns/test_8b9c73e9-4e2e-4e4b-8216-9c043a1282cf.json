["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the provided documents, it can be seen that there is no direct mention of simple random sampling. However, we can analyze the types of sampling designs mentioned: stratified cluster randomization design, stratified sampling, and regression estimators.

Therefore, we can conclude that simple random sampling is not ideal for any specific type of population.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
