["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to the provided documents, postural hypotension is characterized by a drop in blood pressure upon standing. In the 'Postural change in blood pressure associated with age and systolic blood pressure' document, it is mentioned that postural change in blood pressure was defined as a drop of 20 mmHg or more on change from supine to seated position. This suggests that the decrease in blood pressure occurs within minutes. The 'Central haemodynamics in patients with severe postural hypotension' document also mentions that during tilt, vascular resistance and heart rates were increased and stroke volumes and left ventricular ejection time indexes were decreased, which may indicate a rapid decrease in blood pressure.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: Decreases in diastolic blood pressure 20 mmHg within 3 mins\""]
