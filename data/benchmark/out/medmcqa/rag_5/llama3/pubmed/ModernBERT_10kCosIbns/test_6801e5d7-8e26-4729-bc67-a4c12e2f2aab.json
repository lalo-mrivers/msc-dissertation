["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about factors that can retard the setting time of zinc phosphate. According to the first document 'Viscosity changes of zinc phosphate cements in setting process', the coefficient of setting speed and the setting time were observed to be affected by shear rate, environmental temperature, and P/L ratio. As the shear rate increased, the coefficient decreased and the setting time increased. This suggests that increasing the addition of powder to liquid (C) could potentially retard the setting time. Additionally, the document 'The effect of cold temperature mixing on the properties of zinc phosphate cement' states that mixing at a lower temperature can increase the working time and decrease the setting time, which is consistent with the idea of retarding the setting time.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
