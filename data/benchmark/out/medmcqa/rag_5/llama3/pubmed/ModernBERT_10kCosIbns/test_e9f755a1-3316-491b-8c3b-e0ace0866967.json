["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about a patient who has had a partial denture inserted 3 weeks ago and is now experiencing sensitivity to chewing pressure. We need to consider what could be causing this sensitivity. The documents mention chronic occlusal trauma of partial denture abutments, which may not always show clinical symptoms immediately.
