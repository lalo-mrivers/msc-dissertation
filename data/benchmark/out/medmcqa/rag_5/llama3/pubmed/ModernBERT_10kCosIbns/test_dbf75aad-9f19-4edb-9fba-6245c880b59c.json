["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking which of the options show chemical bond with enamel. From the given documents, it can be seen that composites (in Mechanism of adhesion of polymers to acid-etched enamel) and BIS-GMA resins in pit and fissure sealants (in The adaptation of composite materials to etched enamel surfaces) both form bonds with enamel. Direct filling resins are not mentioned forming chemical bond with enamel, but it is stated that they do not require an intermediate unfilled resin or bonding agent for retention on the etched enamel surface. Polycarboxylate cements are not shown to form a chemical bond with enamel.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
