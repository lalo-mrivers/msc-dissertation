["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the use of solvent detergent (SD) method for virus inactivation. The SD plasma does not compensate for factors that activate or inhibit coagulation, nor for fibrinolytic factors. It is also mentioned that most tested batches contain heparin in therapeutic quantities. The pH values are pushed far into the alkaline range which could have fatal consequences if administered to severely ill patients. Considering these points, we can infer that SD plasma might be more likely to cause adverse effects. Given the context, HIV is a lipid-enveloped virus and its destruction by SD plasma seems plausible.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
