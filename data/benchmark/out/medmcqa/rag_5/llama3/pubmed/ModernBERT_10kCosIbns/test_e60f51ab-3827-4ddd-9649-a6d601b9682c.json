["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the root value of cremaster reflex. The relevant documents describe studies on proprioceptive innervation of the external cremaster muscle of some domestic mammals, the nature of suprasegmental influences on the late reflex activity in human forearm muscles, and the pharmacological characteristics of slow tonic muscle. None of these studies provide direct information about the root value of cremaster reflex. Therefore, we need to look for indirect clues or related information. The document 'A mammalian muscle with the pharmacological characteristics of slow tonic muscle' describes the properties of guinea-pig isolated cremaster muscle, including its response to various stimulants and its ability to maintain tetanic contractions at 20 Hz. This suggests that the cremaster muscle is innervated by sacral nerves (S1-S4). Based on this information, we can infer that the root value of cremaster reflex is related to these sacral nerves.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: S3, S4\""]
