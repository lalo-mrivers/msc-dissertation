["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant document for this question is 'Effect of anaerobiosis and glucose on the content of haem and its precursors in intact yeast cells.' According to this document, delta-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) synthetase is the first enzyme of the haem biosynthetic pathway. The pathway starts with ALA, which is then converted into porphobilinogen, and finally leads to the formation of haem. Therefore, we can conclude that alpha-keto glutarate is used in haem synthesis.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
