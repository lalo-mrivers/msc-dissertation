["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the maximum pCO2 seen in arterial gas analysis. We can see from the documents that alveolar PCO2 (pCO2) exceeds pulmonary end-capillary CO2 (pCO2). This is also discussed in the context of Christian Bohr's observation in 1891, where he found that alveolar PCO2 could exceed arterial PCO2. Therefore, maximum pCO2 is seen during steady-state conditions.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
