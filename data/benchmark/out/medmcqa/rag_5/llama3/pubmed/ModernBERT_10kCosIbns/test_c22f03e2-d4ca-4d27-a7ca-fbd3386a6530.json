["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the formulation of modern precapsulated dental amalgam. We can look at the documents to find information on the composition of dental amalgams. The 'Effect of trituration on dimensional changes of dental amalgam' document mentions that 10 commercially available dental amalgam alloys were used, but it does not specify their composition in terms of mercury content. However, the 'Biocompatibility testing of some dental amalgams in vivo' document discusses the biological responses to five Australian manufactured dental amalgams: Permite C, Lojic, F400, New Ultrafine and GS80. It does not provide information on their composition either. The 'Dental amalgam stabilization by selective interfacial amalgamation' document does not discuss the formulation of precapsulated dental amalgam either.\n\nThe only relevant information we can find is from the 'One-hour compressive strength of dental amalgam' document, which mentions that large differences between different alloys were observed. However, it does not provide specific information on the mercury content of these alloys.\n\nTherefore, we cannot determine the most modern precapsulated dental amalgam formulated with a certain percentage of hg by wt. based on the provided documents.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"None\"\n}"]
