["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents provide information on the duration of postherpetic neuralgia. In the first document, it is mentioned that postherpetic neuralgia is defined by the persistence of pain following herpes zoster for some arbitrarily defined period, such as two months. However, this definition does not specify a specific number of weeks. The second document provides more information on the prognosis with postherpetic neuralgia and mentions that nearly half of all patients were doing well at the final assessment (median 2 years) and more than half of these were on no therapy at this time. This suggests that postherpetic neuralgia is defined as pain lasting beyond two months, which is equivalent to approximately 8 weeks. Therefore, the answer is not explicitly stated in the documents.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
