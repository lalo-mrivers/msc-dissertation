["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about pure left-sided failure. From the documents, we can see that left ventricular failure results in dilatation, deformation and loss of funnel function of the left atrium. In more advanced stages of left ventricular failure, the pulmonary veins become coiled, dilated and narrow stepwise instead of the normal harmonic narrowing to the periphery. This suggests that pure left-sided failure is not related to a specific lesion such as ASD, aortic stenosis or patent ductus arteriosus.\n\nInstead, it is more likely caused by the changes in the left ventricular shape and function due to heart failure. Therefore, we can conclude that the correct answer is none of the above options.\", \"answer_choice\": A}"]
