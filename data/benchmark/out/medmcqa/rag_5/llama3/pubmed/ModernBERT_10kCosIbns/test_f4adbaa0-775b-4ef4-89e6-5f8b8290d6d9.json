["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the most common inherited malignancy. From the given documents, we can infer that there are various types of cancer that can be inherited. The document 'Genealogy of cancer in a family' suggests that some families may have an incompletely penetrant autosomal dominant gene with pleiotropic effects, which could lead to various types of cancer. The document '[Mendelian genetics and cancer]' mentions that genetically controlled tumors can result from two successive mutations, but also notes that the actual cancerogenic factor can be environmental and not genetic. Another point to consider is that hereditary cancer syndromes are generally produced by the inheritance of a single mutant gene, as mentioned in 'The biology and genetics of hereditary cancers'. Considering these points, we can think about which type of cancer is commonly inherited. One document mentions an example of an autosomal dominant pattern with pleiotropic effects, which could be related to Retinoblastoma or other types of cancer that are known to have a strong genetic component.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
