["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the most common mode of spread of retinoblastoma. The first document discusses unilateral and bilateral cases of retinoblastoma, but it does not specifically address the modes of spread. The second document discusses survival rate and risk factors for patients with retinoblastoma in Japan, including extraocular invasion as a significant risk factor predictive of death due to tumor. This suggests that direct invasion or extraocular invasion may be a mode of spread. The third document analyzes misdiagnosed retinoblastoma cases and mentions optic nerve invasion but does not emphasize it as the most common mode of spread. Finally, the fourth document discusses diagnosis, heredity, and treatment, but it does not provide specific information on modes of spread. Based on this analysis, we can infer that the most common mode of spread is likely direct or extraocular invasion.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
