["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"After reviewing the documents related to maxillofacial morphogenesis, it is noted that during the fetal period, the four primary growth centers are the most active sites for maxilla formation until 20 weeks of gestation. Thereafter, the growth of the maxilla is enhanced by the participation of intramembranous bone formation along the periphery. This suggests that there may be multiple blood supply routes to the maxilla during fetal development and possibly after birth as well.
