["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about precipitation of proteins. From the provided documents, we can see that precipitation has been discussed as a process for protein concentration and purification. However, none of the given options directly relate to precipitation. Protein nitrogen unit (PNU) phosphotungstic acid (PTA) precipitation procedure is mentioned in the 'Optimization of parameters in protein nitrogen unit precipitation procedure for allergenic extracts' document, but it doesn't match any of the given choices. Therefore, we need to look at general principles of protein precipitation and its applications. The 'Separation processes in biotechnology. Precipitation' document mentions various precipitants, such as salts of heavy metals. This suggests that precipitation can be achieved by adding salts of heavy metals.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
