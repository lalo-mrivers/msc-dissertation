["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The provided documents discuss various aspects of arterial stenoses, including the effects of multiple subcritical stenoses on poststenotic pressure and flow, velocity field studies at surgically imposed arterial stenoses, the role of multiple noncritical arterial stenoses in the pathogenesis of ischemia, hemodynamics of arterial stenoses at elevated flow rates, and experimental analysis of the influence of stenotic geometry on steady flow. None of these documents mention isolated aoic stenoses or discuss symptoms related to aortic stenosis. Therefore, we must consider general knowledge about aortic stenosis.\n\nAortic stenosis is typically characterized by a systolic thrill (pulsus bisferiens) and a murmur that can be heard in the carotid arteries, not just in the carotid artery itself. The cardiac apex is displaced to the left, but this is not unique to isolated aoic stenoses. Blood pressure may decrease during the initial phase of aortic stenosis due to increased resistance caused by the narrowing of the aortic lumen.\n\nThe question asks what is true about isolated aoic stenoses except. Since none of these documents discuss isolated aoic stenoses, we cannot conclude anything from the provided information. However, based on general knowledge, all options seem plausible symptoms or characteristics of aortic stenosis except for option D: Blood pressure maintained in initial phase. This is because blood pressure typically decreases during the initial phase of aortic stenosis due to increased resistance.\", \"answer_choice\": C}"]
