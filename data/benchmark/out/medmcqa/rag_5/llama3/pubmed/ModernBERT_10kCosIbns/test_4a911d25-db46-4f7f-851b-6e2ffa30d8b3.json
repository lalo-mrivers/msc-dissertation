["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The compressive strength of bone is proportional to the square of the apparent density and to the strain rate raised to the 0.06 power (document 1). This suggests that the mineral component of bone plays a significant role in compression resistance, as it affects the apparent density. Additionally, document 3 discusses the mechanical causes of bone remodelling, highlighting the importance of stress distribution within the bone. In this context, it is logical to assume that the mineral component of bone is responsible for resisting compression.\n\nDocument 2 provides further evidence, demonstrating that the slope of the plastic region in the stress-strain curve of cortical bone remains constant despite decalcification, suggesting that the mineral phase contributes the major portion of the tension yield strength. This implies that the mineral component also plays a significant role in resistance to compression.\n\nFinally, document 4 presents a model for determining the influence of protection from stress in bone, which further supports the idea that the mineral component is crucial for resisting compression.\n\nConsidering these points, it is clear that the mineral component of bone plays a primary role in resisting compression.\", \"answer_choice\": D}"]
