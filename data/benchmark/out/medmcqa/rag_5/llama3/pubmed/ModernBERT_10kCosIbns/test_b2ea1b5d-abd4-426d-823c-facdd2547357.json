["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents mention the tensile properties of orthodontic wire, including stainless steel. According to 'Reduction in the modulus of elasticity in orthodontic wires', severe cold drawing can result in a lower modulus, which is often hardening. This suggests that bending orthodontic wire at room temperature is an example of strain hardening (work/strain hardening).\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
