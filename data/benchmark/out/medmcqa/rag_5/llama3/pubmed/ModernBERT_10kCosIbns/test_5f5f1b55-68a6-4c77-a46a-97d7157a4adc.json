["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for conditions that can cause medullary nephrocalcinosis. We are given a 3-month-old infant with bilateral medullary nephrocalcinosis. From the provided documents, we know that nephrocalcinosis is uncommon in childhood, and main causes include renal tubular acidosis, hyperparathyroidism, and medullary sponge kidney. Additionally, it can be seen where there is hypercalcaemia or hypercalciuria of any aetiology. Hyperoxaluria is mentioned as one of the causes of nephrocalcinosis in a previous document. Medullary sponge kidney is also mentioned as one of the causes of nephrocalcinosis in another document. Therefore, we can conclude that hyperoxaluria and medullary sponge kidney are both possible causes of medullary nephrocalcinosis.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
