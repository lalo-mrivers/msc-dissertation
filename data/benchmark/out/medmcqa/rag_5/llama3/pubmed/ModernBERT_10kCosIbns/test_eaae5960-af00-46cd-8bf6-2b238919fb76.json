["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided, we can eliminate choices D (Inherited congenital hemophilia) as PPH usually develops within 24 hours after birth. Also, APTT and PTT being prolonged while BT, PT, and platelet counts are normal suggests that there might be an acquired coagulation disorder. Acquired hemophilia (choice A) is a possibility due to the abnormal coagulation profile. Lupus anticoagulant (choice B) cannot be ruled out as it can also cause prolongation of APTT and PTT. DIC (choice C) is unlikely as platelet counts are normal, which would be low in case of disseminated intravascular coagulation.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
