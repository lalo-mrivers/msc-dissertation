["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks which one of the following is not used as an abrasive in the dentifrice. We need to look for the documents that mention the abrasives used in the dentifrices. From the first document, it's mentioned that two abrasives were tested, but they are not specified. The third and fourth documents do not provide information about the abrasives used in the dentifrices. However, the second document mentions a study that included four concentrations of abrasive and three diluents. It also states that all dentifrices except one (which did not contain abrasive materials) had abrasive effects on both acrylic resin and human tooth. Based on this information, we can conclude that Calcium carbonate, Silica, and Sodium Chloride are likely to be abrasives used in the dentifrices. Amylase is an enzyme that breaks down carbohydrates, but it's not an abrasive. Therefore, Amylase is the correct answer.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
