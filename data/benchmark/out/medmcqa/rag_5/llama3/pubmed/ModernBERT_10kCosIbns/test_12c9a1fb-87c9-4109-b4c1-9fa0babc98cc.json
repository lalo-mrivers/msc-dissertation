["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about cardiac defects characterized by ductus-dependent blood flow. The term 'ductus-dependent' refers to the fact that certain congenital heart defects require the ductus arteriosus (a normal fetal structure) to be patent for survival. In this case, we need to identify which of the given options do NOT fit this characteristic.\n\nUpon reviewing the provided documents, I found no direct information about the relationship between ductus-dependent blood flow and the listed cardiac defects. However, based on my knowledge of cardiology, I can analyze each option:\n\nOption A: Transposition of great arteries with intact septum - This condition is not typically characterized by ductus-dependent blood flow.\nOption B: Interrupted aortic arch - This defect does require ductus-dependent blood flow for survival.\nOption C: Truncus arteriosus - Similar to interrupted aortic arch, this condition also requires ductus-dependent blood flow.\nOption D: Hypoplastic left heart syndrome - This defect typically requires ductus-dependent blood flow.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A: Transposition of great arteries with intact septum.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
