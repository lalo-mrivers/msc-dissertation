["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant document provided is 'Gingival recession. The condition, process, and treatment.' It discusses the condition of gingival recession and its attendant patient complaints and professional concerns. However, it does not explicitly state the most common cause of gingival recession. Another document, 'Recession: a 4-year longitudinal study after free gingival grafts,' mentions that the importance of anatomical factors such as alveolar bone dehiscence and lack of attached gingiva is unknown. This suggests that the causes of gingival recession are complex and may involve various factors. Considering this information, it seems unlikely that a single cause would be explicitly stated.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
