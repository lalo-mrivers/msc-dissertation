["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to the document 'Aortic nerve-activated cardioinhibitory neurons and interneurons', unit activity evoked by electrical stimulation of the aortic and vagus nerves was recorded in the dorsal motor nucleus and nucleus solitarius of unanesthetized rabbits. Cardioinhibitory cells which showed antidromic activation to stimulation of the vagus nerve and synaptic activation to stimulation of the aortic nerve were localized in lateral dorsal motor nucleus 0.5-0.8 mm anterior of the obex.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
