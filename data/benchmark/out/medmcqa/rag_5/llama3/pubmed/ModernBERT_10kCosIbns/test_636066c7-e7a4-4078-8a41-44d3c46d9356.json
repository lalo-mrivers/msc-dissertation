["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the provided documents, it is clear that unsaturated fatty acids are essential for maintaining healthy lipid profiles. The paper 'Effects of dietary saturated and trans fatty acids on tissue lipid composition and serum LCAT activity in the rat' suggests that polyunsaturated fatty acids are necessary for proper metabolism of cholesterol. Additionally, the meta-analysis 'Effect of dietary fatty acids on serum lipids and lipoproteins. A meta-analysis of 27 trials' shows that all unsaturated fatty acids (saturated, monounsaturated, and polyunsaturated) elevated high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol when substituted for carbohydrates. This indicates a positive association between intake of unsaturated fatty acids and cardiovascular health.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
