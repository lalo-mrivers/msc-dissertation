["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the provided documents, we can infer that cells with high transmembrane potential (TMP) are non-dividing cells, whereas cells with low TMP have a high division rate. When a cell is exposed to an external electrical field, its TMP is altered, which could contribute to the normalisation of abnormal cell proliferation. The resting potential of cells depends on the concentration of charged nonpenetrating molecules inside the cell. In excitable cells, repolarization occurs after an action potential, and this event is associated with changes in ion fluxes.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: K+ influx\""]
