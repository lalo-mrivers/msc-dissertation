["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks which statements about B. fragilis are true except. The relevant documents describe serological studies of B. fragilis, the use of semisolid agar from initiation of pure infection, a study of surface and somatic antigens, rapid identification methods, and changes in susceptibility to antimicrobial agents. There is no information that suggests shock and DIC are common in Bacteroides bacteremia. The documents do mention large subcutaneous abscesses at the site of injection which can be observed grossly within 7 days after injection, but this does not imply a systemic response like shock and DIC.\n\nRegarding the sensitivity to metronidazole, the document 'Changes in the susceptibility of Bacteroides fragilis group organisms to various antimicrobial agents 1979-1989' states that there was no emergence of resistance to metronidazole. Therefore, statement B: B. fragilis is sensitive to metronidazole is likely true.\n\nThe documents also describe the surface and somatic antigens of B. fragilis, including the formation of O-antigens which are lipopolysaccharides (LPS). The document 'A study of the surface and somatic antigens of Bacteroides fragilis' suggests that these LPS may be structurally and functionally different from conventional endotoxin.\n\nFinally, statement A: B. fragilis is the most frequent anaerobe isolated from clinical samples is not supported by any information in the provided documents. The document 'Use of semisolid agar from initiation of pure Bacteroides fragilis infection in mice' mentions that large subcutaneous abscesses at the site of injection can be observed, but it does not provide any information about the frequency of isolation.\n\nTherefore, based on the analysis of the provided documents, statement D: Shock & DIC are common in Bacteroides bacteremia is likely to be false. Statement A: B. fragilis is the most frequent anaerobe isolated from clinical samples may also be false since no such information is available in the provided documents.\",\n\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
