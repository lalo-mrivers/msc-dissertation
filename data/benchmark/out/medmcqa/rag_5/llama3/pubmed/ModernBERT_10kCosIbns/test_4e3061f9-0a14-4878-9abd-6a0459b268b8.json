["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the function of T-lymphocytes, specifically their role in cellular immunity. The first document mentions that T-lymphocytes are at the heart of the physiopathological mechanism of most dysimmunity affections, and that some cases of granulomatosis come within the framework of T-lymphocyte diseases. The second document discusses the histochemical localization of T-cells in tissue sections, showing their presence in the periarteriolar lymphatic sheaths of the spleen and the diffusely infiltrated area of the cloacal bursa. The third document investigates the differentiation of functionally active mouse T-lymphocytes from functionally inactive bone marrow precursors, showing that both organs contain a post-thymic precursor pool able to regenerate limited T cell responses in thymectomized recipients. The fourth document discusses 'early T cells' and 'late T cells', suggesting evidence for two T cell lineages with separate developmental pathways. Finally, the fifth document shows that induction of secondary cytotoxic T-lymphocytes in vitro does not require cell proliferation.\n\nGiven this information, we can see that T-lymphocytes play a primary role in cellular immunity, and are involved in diseases such as granulomatosis. They also play a key role in the immune response, with functionally active cells being able to regenerate limited T cell responses in thymectomized recipients.\n\nTherefore, based on these findings, we can conclude that T-lymphocytes play a primary role in B: Production of lymphokines and delayed hypersensitivity.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
