["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, it is clear that the lesions of the temporal bone can be cancerous or non-cancerous. The most important aspect to consider is the need for accurate diagnosis and localization of the lesion. A thorough physical examination and imaging studies would be necessary to determine the extent of the lesion. Given the complexity of the temporal bone anatomy, a combination of radiological investigations would be more suitable than relying on a single modality.\\r\\n\\r\\nCT scans are mentioned in one of the documents as being used for partial resection of the temporal bone. Additionally, CT scans provide excellent spatial resolution and are effective in detecting lesions of the temporal bone. MRI is not specifically mentioned in any of the provided documents, but it can be a valuable tool for identifying lesions of the temporal bone. USG is not relevant to this question as it does not have sufficient resolution to detect lesions of the temporal bone.\\r\\n\\r\\nConsidering these points, CT scans would be the investigation of choice for a lesion of the temporal bone.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
