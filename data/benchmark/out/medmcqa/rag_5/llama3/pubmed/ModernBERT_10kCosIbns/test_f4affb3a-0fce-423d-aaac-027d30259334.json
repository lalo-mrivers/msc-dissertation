["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"This question is related to the physiology of nerve fibers. The relevant document is 'A technique for high-sensitivity alpha autoradiography of bronchial epithelium tissue.' In this technique, alpha-particles are used to detect the microdistribution of alpha-particle active nuclei in bronchial tissue. Since A-alpha fibers refer to a specific type of nerve fiber, it is not directly related to the alpha-particles used in the autoradiography technique. Therefore, the question cannot be answered based on the provided documents.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
