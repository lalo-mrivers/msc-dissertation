["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents provided describe the structure of dental calculus and cementum. Dental calculus is composed of two components with distinguishable patterns of calcification: one formed by the precipitation of minute calcific crystals on microorganisms and intermicrobial substances, and another exhibiting a configuration of generally larger crystal growths of varying shapes and sizes. This information suggests that the portion of tooth covered by calculus or altered cementum might be related to the structure of the mineral deposits. Additionally, the document [Superficial structure of dental cement as shown by acid etching and scanning electron microscope] describes the superficial layer of cementum as a mineralized structure with organic fibers. This information suggests that the portion of tooth covered by calculus or altered cementum might be related to the presence of these fibers.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
