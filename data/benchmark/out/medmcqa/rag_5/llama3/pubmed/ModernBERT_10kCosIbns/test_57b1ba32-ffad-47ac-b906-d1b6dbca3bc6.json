["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the potential effect of adding verapamil to a patient already taking metoprolol. Verapamil can cause bradycardia (slow heart rate) and AV block (atrioventricular block). Metoprolol, on the other hand, is a beta blocker that can also cause bradycardia. Therefore, adding verapamil to a patient already taking metoprolol may enhance this effect, leading to more severe bradycardia.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B\n}"]
