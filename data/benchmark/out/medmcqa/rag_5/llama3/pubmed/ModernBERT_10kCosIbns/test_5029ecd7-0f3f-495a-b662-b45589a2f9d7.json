["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents suggest that meconium staining is associated with increased neonatal mortality rate and various complications. Among the documents, we find that among infants who died, the incidence of erythroblastosis was quadrupled and cardiovascular malformation was doubled in the stained group.
