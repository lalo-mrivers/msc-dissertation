["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the effect of doubling the length of a spring. From the Force degradation of closed coil springs document, we can see that the initial force value for each spring type was determined by extending the springs to generate an initial force value in the range of 150 to 160 gm. This means that the force output of the springs is proportional to their length. Therefore, when the length of a spring is doubled, the effect would be to quadruple its initial force value.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
