["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking which cements are not suitable for cementing acrylic temporary crowns. From the provided documents, it seems that 'The retentive ability of various cementing agents for polycarbonate crowns' and 'The degree of zinc phosphate cement coverage of complete crown preparations and its effect on crown retention' are relevant to this question. In the first document, it is mentioned that polycarboxylate, zinc phosphate, and reinforced zinc oxide-eugenol cements are not recommended for cementing polycarbonate crowns. Since acrylic temporary crowns are also made of a similar material (polycarbonate), these cements may not be suitable for them as well. Therefore, options B: Zinc phosphate, A: Zinc oxide eugenol should not be used.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: None of the above\"\n}"]
