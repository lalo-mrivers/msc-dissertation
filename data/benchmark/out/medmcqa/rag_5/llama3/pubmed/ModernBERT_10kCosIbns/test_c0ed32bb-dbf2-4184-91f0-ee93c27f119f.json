["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the pulmonary diffusing capacity for CO (Dco) during breathing of room air and gas mixtures with differing physical properties. The study shows a clear negative correlation between Dco and the molecular weight of the gases used, which is most easily explained on the basis of an airway diffusion resistance limiting CO transfer.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
