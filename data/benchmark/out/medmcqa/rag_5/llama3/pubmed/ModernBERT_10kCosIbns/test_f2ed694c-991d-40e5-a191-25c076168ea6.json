["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to the provided documents, biofilm forming bacteria causes antimicrobial resistance through several mechanisms. Firstly, it forms a mechanical barrier that hinders antibiotic diffusion (Bacterial resistance to antibiotics: the role of biofilms). Secondly, it alters the environment conditions of the niche where the biofilm resides, which can also contribute to antibiotic resistance. The provided documents do not mention increased excretion of antibiotics or altered metabolism as mechanisms of antimicrobial resistance caused by biofilm forming bacteria. Therefore, these options are unlikely to be correct.\n\nThe option 'D: Adherence' is actually a mechanism that leads to the formation of biofilms rather than a direct cause of antimicrobial resistance. However, it is an important step in the development of antibiotic resistance.\n\nThe correct answer choice based on the provided documents and mechanisms of antimicrobial resistance is A: Mechanical barrier.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
