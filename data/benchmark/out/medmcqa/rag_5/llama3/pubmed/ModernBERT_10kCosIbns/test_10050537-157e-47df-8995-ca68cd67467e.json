["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for an anticholinergic drug that doesn't cross the blood-brain barrier and placenta. From the provided documents, we know that atropine is a tertiary anticholinergic drug which means it can penetrate the blood-brain barrier and placenta (Central versus peripheral anticholinergic activity as assessed by two in vivo procedures in mice). On the other hand, quaternary anticholinergic drugs such as glycopyrrolate bromide do not cross the blood-brain barrier or placenta because they are charged and repelled by the negative charge on the neural membranes (Comparative affinity of several standard anti-secretory agents for the intestinal cholinergic receptors of rats and dogs). Therefore, the answer is A: Glycopyrrolate bromide.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
