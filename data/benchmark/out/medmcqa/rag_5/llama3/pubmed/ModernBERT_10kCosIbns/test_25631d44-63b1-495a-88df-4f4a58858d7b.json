["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents provided describe the composition of plaque. In the study of in vivo plaque formation, it is mentioned that the plaque consists of microorganisms and a non-structured matrix. This suggests that microorganisms are one of the main components of plaque. Additionally, the histological study of artificial plaque also shows that the structure of artificial plaque is very similar to the natural one in morphology and structure, with bacteria being one of the main components. Finally, the multibacterial artificial plaque establishes a typical structure same as natural plaque was seen under microscope, suggesting that microorganisms are a key component of plaque.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
