["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"None of the given documents seem to be directly related to rake angles or their orientation with respect to the radial line. However, we can look for any information on the relationship between facial dimensions and the ANB angle, as mentioned in the critical evaluation of the ANB angle. It seems that faces having the same anteroposterior value for the jawbones can have very different ANB angles (Figs. 3 and 4) and vice versa. This implies that there may be variations in facial dimensions that affect the ANB angle, which could potentially relate to rake angles.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
