["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe various aspects of zygomatic complex fractures. We are looking for the most common site of zygomatic arch fracture. The document 'Fractures of the zygomatic complex in the south-east region of Scotland' doesn't provide specific information on this topic. The paper 'Anatomic, clinical, surgical, and radiographic correlation of the zygomatic complex fracture' describes the mechanisms by which clinical signs and symptoms are produced, but it doesn't specify the most common site of zygomatic arch fracture either. However, the document '[Zygomatic arch fractures; a neurosurgical viewpoint]' mentions depressed fractures of the zygomatic arch. This suggests that the zygomatic arch is involved in some way. The paper '[The value of ultrasonography in the diagnosis of zygomatic arch fractures]' uses ultrasonograms to verify the result of a zygomatic fracture reduction, which implies that the zygomatic arch can be fractured. Finally, the document 'Treatment results after zygomatico-orbital fractures' doesn't provide any information on this topic.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
