["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the type of porosity formed due to simultaneous nucleation of solid grains and gas bubbles at the moment metal freezes at the mold walls. Upon reviewing the provided documents, we can see that none of the documents explicitly mention this type of porosity. However, we can infer from the document 'The effect of variation in mould temperature, metal temperature and mould size on the development of internal porosity in cast structures' that the formation of porosity is related to the solidification process and the movement of gas bubbles within the mold. Based on this information, it is likely that the type of porosity described in the question is related to gas inclusion.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
