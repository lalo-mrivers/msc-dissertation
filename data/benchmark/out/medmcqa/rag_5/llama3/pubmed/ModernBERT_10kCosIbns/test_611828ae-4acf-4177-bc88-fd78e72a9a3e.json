["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the primary colonization of plaque. The study 'Study of in vivo plaque formation' suggests that the thickness of the plaque layer is apparently determined primarily by the number of microorganisms present. This implies that the initial colonizers of the plaque are likely to be those that can quickly multiply and establish themselves on the surface. In this context, the primary colonization of plaque is likely dominated by facultative anaerobic Gram - ve rods as they can quickly adapt to different environments and multiply rapidly.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
