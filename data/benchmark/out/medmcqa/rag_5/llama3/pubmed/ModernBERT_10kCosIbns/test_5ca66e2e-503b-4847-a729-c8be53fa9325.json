["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"There are no documents mentioning typhoid or monocytic count. However, we can analyze the given documents for any information related to lymphocytic counts. The first document talks about large granular T lymphocytes, neutropenia and polyarthropathy. It does not mention monocytic count. The second document discusses IgG, IgM and IgA antibodies in sera of persons with different relation to typhoid infection. There is no information about monocytic count. The third document studies the interaction between the causative agent and cells of the organism during experimental typhoid infection and carrier state. It does not mention monocytic count either. The fourth document talks about transient hyperthyroidism in patients with lymphocytic thyroiditis and association between thyrotoxicosis and thrombocytopenia. Again, there is no information about monocytic count.\n\nThe only remaining possibility is that the increased monocytic count might be related to typhoid infection. The first document does not provide any specific information about monocytic count, but it talks about abnormal B cell function with increased level of at least one immunoglobulin isotype in all patients. This could imply some relation to immune response or inflammation, which might lead to an increase in monocytic count.\n\nHowever, there is no direct evidence in the given documents that supports this conclusion. Therefore, we can only speculate about a possible connection between typhoid infection and increased monocytic count without any concrete evidence.\", \n\"answer_choice\": \"D: None of the above\""]
