["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The reaction involves the conversion of glucose-6-phosphate to fructose-6-phosphate. This is described in the document 'Fructose-6-phosphate substrate cycling and hormonal regulation of gluconeogenesis in vivo.' The key point here is that this is a part of the fructose-6-phosphate substrate cycle, which includes phosphofructokinase (PFK) and fructose-1,6-diphosphatase (FDPase). This suggests that the conversion from glucose-6-P to fructose-6-P is an isomerisation reaction.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
