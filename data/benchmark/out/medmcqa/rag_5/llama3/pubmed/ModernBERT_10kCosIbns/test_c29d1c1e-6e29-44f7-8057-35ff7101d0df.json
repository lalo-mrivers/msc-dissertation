["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking which component is responsible for adhesion of platelets on exposed collagen fibril after an injury. From the provided documents, it can be seen that the adhesion of human platelets to immobilized collagen is extremely rapid, with initial rates approaching 3% of single particles adhering per 10 ms. The process is RGD-independent and not associated with platelet aggregation or secretion. The monoclonal antibody 6F1 directed against the glycoprotein Ia/IIa complex inhibited adhesion, suggesting that this complex plays an important role in the initial phases of platelet-collagen interaction under flow conditions. Additionally, divalent cations were required for adhesion, as indicated by inhibition with EDTA in plasma and the dependence on Mg2+ for washed platelets.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D: Fibronectin\"}"]
