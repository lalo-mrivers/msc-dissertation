["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about which sinus grows till early adulthood. Cranial dermal sinuses are mentioned in the first document, but it doesn't specify which type of sinus. The second document talks about congenital midline sinuses of the dorsum of the nose, but it's not related to the question. The third and fourth documents discuss chronic sinusitis in children, but they don't provide information on sinus growth till early adulthood. The fifth document discusses diagnosis and treatment of congenital defects and abnormalities of the nasal cavity, but it doesn't specifically mention which type of sinus grows till early adulthood.\n\nThe only relevant information is from the first document, where cranial dermal sinuses are described. Since these sinuses are found in children up to 16 years of age, we can infer that they do not grow till early adulthood. The other types of sinuses (maxillary, ethmoidal, frontal, and sphenoid) are not mentioned as growing till early adulthood.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, it's unlikely that any of the listed options (A-D) grows till early adulthood.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
