["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"After analyzing the provided documents, I found that DIC is likely referring to Disinfectant Inactivation. Upon reviewing the relevant texts, I see that Heparin is mentioned as a chemical substance used in medicine, but it's not related to disinfectant testing or inactivation. Epsilon amino caproic acid is also mentioned, but again, its relevance is unclear for DIC. Blood transfusion and Intravenous fluids are medical procedures or treatments, but they're not directly involved with disinfectant testing or inactivation. Therefore, I conclude that Heparin is the option that is not used in DIC.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
