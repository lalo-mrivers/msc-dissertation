["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the type of joint that shows the greatest movement. Based on the provided documents, we can look at the types of joints mentioned: Amphiarthroses (not explicitly discussed), Diarthroses (joints with a cavity), Synarthroses (immovable joints). The text also mentions specific joints such as shoulder, elbow, forearm, wrist, hip, knee, ankle, and foot.
