["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"This question is about the effect of an error on a survey result. The correct approach is to identify the type of mistake and analyze its impact. In this case, an incorrect score of 85 was entered for one sample out of 10. This mistake only affects the highest sample value, which is the maximum score reported. Since this score does not affect the median (middle value) calculation, we can assume that the median will remain unchanged. The mean (average) score might be affected by this error, as it takes into account all the values including the incorrect one.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C: Increased mean, no change in median\""]
