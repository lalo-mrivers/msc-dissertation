["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the response of alveolar bone to traumatic occlusal forces. According to [Quantitative study on the effects of occlusal overload on the remodelling of the alveolar process in the rat], an increase in occlusal forces induces alveolar bone resorption. The study shows that the number of osteoclasts/mm2 and the percentage of resorbing periodontal membrane surface of the socket rise with the increase in occlusal forces. This suggests that osteoclasts are present in areas of pressure.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
