["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the faciolingual dimension of the occlusal portion of a hygienic pontic in constructing a fixed partial denture. The key term here is 'hygienic pontic'. Hygienic pontics are designed to be easily cleaned and maintained, unlike traditional dentures. Therefore, the answer lies in understanding what determines the shape and design of these hygienic pontics. After reviewing the provided documents, it becomes clear that none of the options directly relate to the construction or design of a hygienic pontic. However, upon closer inspection of the 'The design of a two-part acid-etched resin-bonded fixed partial denture' document, we find that this innovative design divided the restoration into two parts, each with a separate path of insertion. The preparation of abutment teeth required minimal reduction and the pontic could not be displaced during function. It is reasonable to assume that this design would also apply to hygienic pontics used in fixed partial dentures. Therefore, the answer must lie in understanding what determines the shape and design of these two-part acid-etched resin-bonded fixed partial dentures.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
