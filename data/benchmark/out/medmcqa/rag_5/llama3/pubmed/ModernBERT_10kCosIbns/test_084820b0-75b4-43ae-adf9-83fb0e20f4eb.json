["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the provided documents, we can see that serum ferritin is mentioned as a sensitive determinant of depleted iron stores. In 'Serum ferritin as an early determinant of decreased iron stores in pregnant women', it is stated that serum ferritin is the most sensitive determinant of depleted iron stores. Additionally, in 'Iron status of pregnant Filipino women as measured by serum ferritin', we see that sensitivity for diagnosis of iron deficiency based on SF (&lt; 12.0 ng/ml) was found to be greater than TS, SI, MCV and MCH. Therefore, it can be concluded that serum ferritin is the most sensitive test for detecting iron depletion in pregnancy.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
