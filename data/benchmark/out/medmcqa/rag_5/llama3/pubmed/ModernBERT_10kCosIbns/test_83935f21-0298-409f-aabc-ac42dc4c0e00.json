["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The provided documents discuss various aspects of medical gloves and procedures. The first document talks about the imperviousness of medical gloves, specifically examining latex specimens. The second document describes a technique called subcutaneous 'pocketing' for replantation of amputated distal phalangeal parts of fingers without vascular anastomoses. The third document discusses protective gloves in dental practice, highlighting their impermeability and difficulties with disinfection.
