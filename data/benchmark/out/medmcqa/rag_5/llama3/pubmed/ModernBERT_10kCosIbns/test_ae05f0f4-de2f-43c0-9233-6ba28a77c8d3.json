["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, I will consider the possible causes of acute cervical lymphadenopathy. The patient has fever and sore throat, which are common symptoms of unspecific cervical lymphadenitis of unknown origin (document 1). Tuberculous cervical lymphadenitis is a common cause of cervical lymphadenopathy in some populations (document 3), but it does not seem to be the primary consideration here since the patient is a child. Histiocytic necrotizing lymphadenitis (Kikuchi's disease) is another possibility, as it often affects young women and presents with similar symptoms (document 2). Chronic lymphadenosis is also a possibility, but it is more commonly associated with older adults and does not seem to be the most likely diagnosis in this case. Considering these options, I would recommend investigating for acute unspecific cervical lymphadenitis of unknown origin rather than tuberculous or malignant causes.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
