["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the treatment of choice for primary grade V vesicoureteric reflux involving both kidneys in a 6 month old boy. The relevant documents describe different scenarios and outcomes regarding vesicoureteric reflux, but none specifically mention grade V reflux or bilateral involvement in an infant. However, we can infer from the information that severe grades of reflux in pre-school children should be treated surgically (Childhood urinary infection associated with vesico-ureteric reflux). The Commentary on management of children with severe vesicoureteral reflux also suggests that surgical treatment may be necessary for severe reflux. Additionally, the study on long-term follow-up of surgically treated vesicoureteric reflux indicates that hypertension is a common complication.\n\nConsidering these points, we can deduce that ureteric reimplantation (B) would be the most suitable option for this 6-month-old boy with primary grade V vesicoureteric reflux involving both kidneys.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
