["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents mention the use of tracheobronchial suction catheters in humans. The study found that mucosal trauma with tracheobronchial suctioning procedures is more likely due to repetition, vigor, and amount of suction applied, regardless of which type of catheter is used. This suggests that the duration of suction may be a factor in causing trauma. However, there is no specific information provided on the optimal duration for suctioning tracheal secretions. Therefore, it can't be concluded from these documents.\", \"answer_choice\": C}"]
