["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks for changes seen in pregnancy. I will look at the provided documents to identify the changes mentioned. In the document about diagnostic ultrasound for detection of intrauterine growth retardation, it is mentioned that the rate of BPD growth was found to be 0.26 cm. per week from 18 to 38 weeks. This implies an increase in cardiac output. Additionally, the document about distinction between early normal intrauterine pregnancies and pathological pregnancies by means of a logistic model mentions increased human chorionic gonadotrophin (HCG) levels, which could be related to changes in peripheral resistance or stroke volume. Therefore, I can conclude that all options A, B, C are seen in pregnancy.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
