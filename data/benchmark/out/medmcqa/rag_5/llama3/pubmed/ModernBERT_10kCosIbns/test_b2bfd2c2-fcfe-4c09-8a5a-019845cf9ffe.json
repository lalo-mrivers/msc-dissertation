["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about pulp mummification. Pulp mummification is the preservation of proteins in mummified tissues. In the provided documents, there are two cases where pulp mummification might be occurring: the first is in the Egyptian mummies and the second is in the naturally mummified human brain tissue. Since this is about dental studies on mummies, we can focus on the dental mummy.
