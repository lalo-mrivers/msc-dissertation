["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the exposure of a pulp horn during restorative procedures on primary molars. There are four options: A) Mesiobuccal pulp horn of 1st molars, B) Distobuccal pulp horn of 1st molars, C) Mesiobuccal pulp horn of 2nd molars, and D) Distobuccal pulp horn of 2nd molars. We need to consider the anatomy of primary molars. According to available information on dental anatomy, primary molars have two roots and three pulp horns: mesiobuccal, distobuccal, and palatal. The mesiobuccal and distobuccal pulp horns are typically found in 1st molars, while the palatal pulp horn is found in both 1st and 2nd molars. Therefore, it's likely that one of the options related to 1st molars will be the correct answer.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
