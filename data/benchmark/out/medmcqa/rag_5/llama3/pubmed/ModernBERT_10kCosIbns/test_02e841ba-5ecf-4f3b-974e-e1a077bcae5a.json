["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about a child who has received full rabies vaccination in December 2018 and now presented with an oozing wound on their great toe. Since the pet had vaccination also, I will think step-by-step based on the relevant documents provided. The document 'Haemorrhagic oedema acute in neonatal skin' does not seem to be directly related to rabies or vaccinations. However, it mentions leukocytoclastic vasculitis and immune complexes which could be important for understanding the current situation.\n\nThe document 'Upper oesophageal web in childhood' is also not relevant to the question.\n\nThe document 'The effect of Eperythrozoon ovis infection on the glucose level and some acid-base factors in the venous blood of sheep' discusses the effects of a specific infection on glucose levels and acid-base factors, which does not seem to be directly related to rabies or vaccinations.\n\nThe document '[Primary diseases of the greater omentum in children]' is about primary acute diseases of the greater omentum in children, which also seems unrelated to the current situation.\n\nBased on these documents, I will focus on the symptoms presented by the child: an oozing wound on their great toe. This could be related to a skin condition or an allergic reaction. The fact that the pet had vaccination also suggests that there might be some allergy or sensitivity issue involved.\n\nGiven this information, I would recommend further investigation into the child's wound and potential allergies or sensitivities before administering any vaccines or treatments.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: Rabies Ig and full vaccination\""]
