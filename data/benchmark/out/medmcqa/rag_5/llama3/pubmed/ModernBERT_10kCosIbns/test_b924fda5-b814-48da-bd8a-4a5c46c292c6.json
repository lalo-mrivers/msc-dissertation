["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the mesodermal basis of the lateral part of the lip. The relevant documents describe the musculature of the upper lip, specifically the insertion pattern of muscle fibers into the skin of the philtrum and vermilion border. The musculus orbicularis oris enters the upper lip from one side, decussates in the midline, and proceeds to insert into the skin on the opposite side lateral to the philtral groove. This suggests that the mesodermal basis of the lateral part of the lip is formed by the maxillary process, as the orbicularis oris muscle originates from this region.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
