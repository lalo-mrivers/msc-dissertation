["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the material used to make ear prosthesis and ocular prosthesis. The provided documents are related to various types of prostheses such as ocular, mandibular, and surgical obturation. However, none of these documents mention ear prosthesis. Therefore, we need to focus on the information provided about ocular prosthesis in the first document. It mentions that the technique of fabricating an ocular prosthesis out of glass is a rare art originating from Th√ºringen (formerly DDR).
