["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents provided describe various antibiotic effects on DNA. One document discusses the electrophoretic mobility shifts of DNA restriction fragments caused by certain antibiotics. Another document shows that some antibiotics can suppress DNA synthesis in normal human lymphocytes. These findings suggest that some antibiotics may interfere with DNA function. The options A, B, and C are all antibiotics, so we must consider the possible interference with DNA function. Option D refers to sulphonamides, which work by inhibiting dihydropteroic acid synthetase. This does not involve direct interference with DNA function. Therefore, considering the antibiotic-induced electrophoretic mobility shifts and suppression of DNA synthesis, option C is a possible answer.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
