["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The article [Structure and function of oral mucosa] explains that understanding the functional morphology and biology of the oral mucosa has advanced, particularly in areas such as epithelial-mesenchymal interaction. The paper [Changes at different ages in the epithelium of the human oral mucosa] describes the changes in structure of the epithelium of the human oral mucous membrane between birth and old age. It mentions that during puberty, there is observed the capacity to develop a protective layer of anuclear horny lumps on the palate and gingiva. This indicates that the oral mucosa has stratified squamous cells.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
