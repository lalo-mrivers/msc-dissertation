["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the provided documents, we know that vertical root fractures are often caused by excessive pressure or forces during obturation of canals or cementation of posts. The document 'Alveolar bone loss associated with vertical root fractures. Report of six cases.' suggests that four vertical fractures probably resulted from the use of excessive pressure at the time of obturation of the canals, and one may have been caused by the cementation of a post. This information implies that the shape of the root canal may not be directly related to the likelihood of vertical root fracture.\n\nThe document 'Vertical root fracture and relative deformation during obturation and post cementation.' presents experimental data on the amount of strain to the root that occurs during obturation and post cementation, but it does not provide information on the cross-sectional shape of the roots used in the study. Therefore, we cannot infer any specific conclusions about the shape of the root most prone to vertical root fracture based on this document.\n\nThe documents 'Removing broken roots--a simple method.' and 'Experimental traction injuries of cervical spinal nerve roots: a scanning EM study of rupture patterns in fresh tissue.' do not provide relevant information for answering this question.\n\nIn conclusion, none of the provided documents suggest that one specific cross-sectional shape is more prone to vertical root fracture than others. Therefore, based on the available evidence, we cannot determine the cross section of the root most prone to vertical root fracture.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A: Round\"\n}"]
