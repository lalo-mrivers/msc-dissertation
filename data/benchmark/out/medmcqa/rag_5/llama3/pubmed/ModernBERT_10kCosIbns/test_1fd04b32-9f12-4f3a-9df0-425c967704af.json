["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has elevated LH and FSH levels, which suggests ovarian failure or lack of follicular development. Given the presence of amenorrhea, it's unlikely that the patient is experiencing a normal menstrual cycle. Therefore, checking for urinary HCG level (A) would not be relevant in this case as it is typically used to confirm pregnancy.
