["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the earliest transient change following tissue injury. The relevant documents mention soft tissue injuries, but they don't provide information on specific changes that occur immediately after injury. However, we can look for general information on the response of the host to infection, as mentioned in the 'Management of soft tissue injury' document. It states that the wound bacterial count gives an accurate prediction of subsequent infection and that wounds combining greater than 10^5 bacteria per gram of tissue are destined to develop infection. This suggests that one of the earliest transient changes following tissue injury might be an increase in neutrophils, which would help combat the infection. Therefore, we can deduce that the answer is related to neutrophilia.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
