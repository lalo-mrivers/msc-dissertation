["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the localization of Xis receptor, which is found to be in the nucleus. Based on the provided documents, we can see that there is no mention of hormone receptors or their localization for Adrenaline (A), Insulin (B), Thyroxine (C), or FSH (D). However, one document talks about a probe called antistasin that reacts specifically with activated factor X (Xa) and detects it on tumor cells. This suggests that Xis might be related to factor X. Additionally, another document discusses the effects of X-irradiation on DNA hybridization, which doesn't provide any direct information about hormone receptors or localization. The only relevant mention of Xis is in a context unrelated to hormones, where it's described as a protein involved in lambda site-specific recombination. Therefore, based on the provided documents, we can conclude that X likely refers to a protein or molecule involved in factor X activation.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
