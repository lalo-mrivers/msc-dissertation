["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has cicatrizing skin lesions, hypoplasia of limbs, diffuse cerebral atrophy, and chorioretinitis. Chorioretinitis can be caused by various infections such as toxoplasmosis, cytomegalovirus (HCMV), or herpes simplex virus. Since the patient is a neonate, it's unlikely that they have acquired an infection like herpes simplex virus. The presence of skin lesions and limb hypoplasia suggests a congenital condition. Therefore, we should focus on infections that can cause congenital chorioretinitis. Based on the provided documents, we know that HCMV is one such infection that can cause chorioretinal degeneration.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
