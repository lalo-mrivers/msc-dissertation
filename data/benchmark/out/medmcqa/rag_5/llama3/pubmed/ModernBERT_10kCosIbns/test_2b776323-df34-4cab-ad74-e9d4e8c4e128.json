["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the distance of the blade from the shank to have anti-rotational stability of the instrument. The relevant information can be found in [New self-retaining retractor to facilitate surgical exposure]. The description mentions that the extra length of the instrument permits considerable upward retraction of the central blade, which implies a distance between the blade and the shank. Additionally, [The sharpening of scaling instruments: I] discusses various cutting modes and edge characteristics, but does not provide information about the anti-rotational stability of the instrument. Therefore, we can rule out the information from this document. [A study of the optical micrometer, the coin gauge, and the diamond knife micrometer in diamond knife calibration] and [The use of a magnetically abrasive finishing for sharpening the blades of medical instruments] do not provide relevant information to answer this question. Finally, [Material found on the cleaned diamond turbine drilling heads after injury cases] discusses potential causes of breakage or deformation of diamond points, but does not mention anti-rotational stability.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
