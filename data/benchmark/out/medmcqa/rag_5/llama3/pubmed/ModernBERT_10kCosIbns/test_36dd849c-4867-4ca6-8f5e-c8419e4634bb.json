["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with a history of fever, headache, vomiting, disorientation, neck rigidity, and seizures. The CECT is normal, but the CSF examination shows an elevated cell count (300 cells/mm3) with polymorphs being 50-70%. This suggests an inflammatory process in the CNS. The protein levels are elevated at 70 mg/dL, which is consistent with an acute inflammatory response. The sugar levels are low at 50 mg/dL, but still higher than the reference range for CSF, suggesting a partial breakdown of the blood-brain barrier. Given the normal CECT and CSF findings, primary or metastatic brain tumor can be ruled out. Considering the patient's symptoms, the presence of polymorphs in the CSF suggests an acute inflammatory process. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is pyogenic meningitis.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
