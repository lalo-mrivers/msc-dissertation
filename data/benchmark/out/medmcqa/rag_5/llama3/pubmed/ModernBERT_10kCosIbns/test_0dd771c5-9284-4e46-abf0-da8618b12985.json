["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The pubertal development of girls is characterized by a staged pattern, with the age of menarche onset and establishment of the ovulation cycle being a critical period. The analysis of physical and sexual development, as well as blood levels of hormones participating in growth regulation, suggests that hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal maturation occurs around this age. Luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) stimulates LH, FSH, testosterone, and estradiol release, but this response is not unique to premature pubarche or menarche onset. The pubertal maximum of linear growth in girls is closely correlated with some stages of secondary sex characters. Clinical aspects of normal pubertal development show that puberty is associated with changes in nearly all organs and structures of the body, including gonads, secondary sexual characteristics, pubertal growth spurt, changes in body composition, and differential growth of certain viscera.\n\nThe etiology of premature pubarche includes premature adrenarche, mild errors of steroidogenesis, precocious puberty, and adrenal and gonadal tumors. ACTH stimulation tests were performed to determine whether any clinical parameters are helpful in distinguishing which children should undergo further evaluation for mild congenital adrenal hyperplasia. The results showed that only responses to ACTH stimulation allowed accurate classification of patients.\n\nThe question asks about the permissive action at the onset of puberty, and considering the above information, GnRH (LHRH) is the hormone involved in stimulating LH, FSH, testosterone, and estradiol release, which is a critical process during pubertal development.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
