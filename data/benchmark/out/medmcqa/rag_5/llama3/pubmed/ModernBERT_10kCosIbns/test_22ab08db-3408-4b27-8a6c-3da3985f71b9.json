["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The study focuses on chromosomal abnormalities in male gametes. In the 'Quantitative analysis of seminiferous epithelium in subfertile carriers of chromosomal translocations' document, it is mentioned that the effect of chromosomal aberrations is to arrest the spermatogenic process at the spermatocyte stage. This suggests that independent assortment of maternal and paternal chromosomes may not occur during this stage. In fact, the 'The chromosome complement of human gametes' document states that non-disjunction of the XY bivalent at the first male meiotic division occurs. This implies that independent assortment may actually occur earlier in the process.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
