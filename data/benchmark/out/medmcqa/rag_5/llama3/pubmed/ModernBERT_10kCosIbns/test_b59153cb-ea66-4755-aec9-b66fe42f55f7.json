["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents provide information on radiography and dental radiographs. The technique of taking intraoral radiographs is described in 'Feline oral-dental radiographic examination and interpretation', which does not mention the process of developing a dental radiograph. The 'Quality assurance: 1' document discusses the identification of problems and how to solve those related to operator technique and the X-ray set, but it does not provide information on developing radiographs. 'Expediting prior approval and containing third-party costs for dental care' is an article about transmitting radiographs, not developing them. The only relevant information can be found in 'Automatic analysis of radiographic images: I. Theoretical considerations', which does not mention the process of developing a dental radiograph either.\n\nThe correct answer must be based on general knowledge or common practice. In this case, it is generally known that developing a dental radiograph involves chemically precipitating metallic silver with a developer containing sodium thiosulphate. Therefore, it is most likely that statement D: It typically involves a developer containing sodium thiosulphate is false.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
