["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the provided documents, it is clear that sexual dimorphism in the growth of the cranium is a significant phenomenon. The study on sexual dimorphism in the growth of the cranium shows that 95% of the growth of the cranium is completed before puberty. This means that the major sexual dimorphisms in body size appear at puberty, but this does not apply to the cranium. Asymmetry, correlations and sex difference in the descriptive properties of the cranium suggest that there are significant differences between the sexes in terms of cranial characteristics. The study on determination of cranial capacity using endocranial dimensions shows that the products of endocranial dimensions found on radiographies provide excellent estimations of cranial capacity, which may indicate some difference between the sizes of the cranium and cephalogram.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: 10% enlargement\"\n}"]
