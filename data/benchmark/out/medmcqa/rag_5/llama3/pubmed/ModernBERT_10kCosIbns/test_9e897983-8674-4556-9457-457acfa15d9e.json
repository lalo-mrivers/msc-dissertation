["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the given documents, we know that WHO considers Hb values (gr./100 ml.) a valid and sufficient parameter for a clinical classification of the different degrees of anaemia in pregnancy. In this case, we are given the mean haemoglobin level of pregnant females as 10.6 g/dL and standard deviation of 2 g/dL. To find the minimum haemoglobin level below which 5% of the pregnant females will have their haemoglobin levels, we can use the z-score method. The z-score is calculated by subtracting the mean from a given value and then dividing it by the standard deviation. We want to find the value that corresponds to a z-score of -1.645 (since 5% of the population falls below this point). We will calculate the minimum haemoglobin level by multiplying the z-score with the standard deviation and adding the mean.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
