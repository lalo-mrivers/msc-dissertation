["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the culture of a virus. The given documents are related to viruses, but they don't specifically mention the culture medium used for culturing enteroviruses and adenoviruses. However, I can consider the context in which viruses are commonly cultured. For example, some viruses such as influenza virus can be cultured on Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells or in eggs. Similarly, Enteroviruses have been shown to grow well in continuous simian cell lines like LLC-MK2 and BGM, and they also infect monkey kidney cells. Based on this information, I can deduce that the virus is cultured in an animal cell line.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D\n}"]
