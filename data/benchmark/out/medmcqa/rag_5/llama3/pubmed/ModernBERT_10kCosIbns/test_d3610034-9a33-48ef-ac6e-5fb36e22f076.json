["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the investigation that the sister expects the physician would ask her to do after the delivery of an infant of diabetic mother. The blood glucose level of the infant is 60 mg/dt which suggests hypoglycemia. As hypoglycemia is a common complication in infants of diabetic mothers, it is likely that the physician would order additional investigations to rule out other possible causes or complications. Since there are no obvious signs of electrolyte imbalance or anemia, CBC and serum potassium tests may not be necessary. Serum calcium test might be ordered if hypocalcemia was suspected but since there is no mention of this in the provided documents, it's unlikely that this would be ordered. Similarly, serum chloride test is not directly related to the case and would not be a priority. Therefore, the most likely investigation that the physician would order is one related to glucose metabolism or other possible complications.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
