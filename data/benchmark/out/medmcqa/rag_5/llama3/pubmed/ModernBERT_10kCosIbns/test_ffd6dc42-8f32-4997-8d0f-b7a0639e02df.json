["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the provided documents, we can see that osteoblasts are derived from osteoprogenitor cells (mentioned in Isolation and characterization of human embryonic osteoblasts). We also know that osteoblasts have a specific ultrastructure, which includes a prominent RER and numerous large mitochondria (Ultrastructure of human osteoblasts and associated matrix in culture). However, there is no information about plasma membrane showing multiple folds or neuropeptide receptors. Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMP) are mentioned as regulators of cell growth and bone-specific gene expression (Concepts of osteoblast growth and differentiation), but the specific regulation of osteoblasts by BMP is not discussed in detail.\n\nTherefore, considering all the information provided, we can conclude that option C and D are true statements about osteoblasts. Option A is also a true statement because it is supported by the text. Therefore, we need to choose the statement that is not true. This leaves us with option B: Regulated by BM P. Although BMP is mentioned in one of the documents, there is no specific information about how it regulates osteoblasts.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the provided information, the correct answer choice is B.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
