["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, it seems that there is no direct information about fixed partial dentures or forces acting through them. However, one document discusses the relationship between the width of the occlusal table and pressures under dentures during function. This suggests that forces may be related to the shape and size of the occlusal surface. Another document discusses the importance of structural integrity in the anterior maxillary segment when designing removable partial dentures. This implies that the forces acting on abutment teeth should be considered when designing dental restorations. Finally, a therapeutic immediate denture concept is described, which highlights the importance of establishing a proper occlusal scheme for prosthetic restoration.\n\nConsidering these points, it can be inferred that the forces acting through a fixed partial denture on the abutment tooth should be directed in a way that minimizes stress and strain on the surrounding tissues. This could mean directing forces at right angles to the long axis of the teeth or parallel to the long axis, depending on the specific design and function of the fixed partial denture.\n\nTherefore, based on these indirect hints and inferences, I would choose option A: As far as possible at right angles to the long axis of the teeth.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
