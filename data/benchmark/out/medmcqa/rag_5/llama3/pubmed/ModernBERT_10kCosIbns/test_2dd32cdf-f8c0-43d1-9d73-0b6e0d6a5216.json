["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the consequences of lingually placed mandibular posteriors. We can look at the relevant documents to find information on mandibular prognathism and its effects. In [Planning the surgical treatment of mandibular prognathism], we see that the technic for calculating a required displacement of the mandible posteriorly is suggested. This suggests that lingually placed mandibular posteriors could potentially cause issues with mandibular protrusion or depression. In [A mechanism for passive mandibular depression], we learn about the development of a system of mandibular protrusion in hominid species, which may be affected by lingually placed mandibular posteriors. Additionally, [Treatment of marked anteroposterior and transverse discrepancies in mandibular prognathism] discusses the correction of anteroposterior and transverse discrepancies, which could also be impacted by lingually placed mandibular posteriors.\n\nConsidering these points, we can deduce that lingually placed mandibular posteriors may cause issues with mandibular protrusion or depression, and potentially affect speech and tongue function. This leads us to conclude that the answer is related to tongue interference, which is supported by [The mandibular position and the masticatory surface complex in rehabilitations with total prostheses], where habitual, neuromuscularly determined, position is recommended as a starting position of the mandible for the construction of this alignment; intraoral, central rod analysis of the support is helpful for the determination. When the lateral teeth are aligned, masticatory stability should be considered.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
