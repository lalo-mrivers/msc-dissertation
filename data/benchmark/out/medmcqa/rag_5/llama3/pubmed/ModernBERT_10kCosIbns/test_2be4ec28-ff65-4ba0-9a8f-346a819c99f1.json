["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Thiamine deficiency affects glucose metabolism. In 'Thiamine deficiency in general hospital patients', it's mentioned that the production of sedoheptulose-7-phosphate is below normal value, which is an intermediate product of glucose metabolism and requires thiamine pyrophosphate as a co-factor for transketolase activity. This suggests that without thiamine, glucose metabolism is impaired. Additionally, 'Mechanical properties of rat cardiac muscle during experimental thiamine deficiency' shows that thiamine-deficient rats exhibited a decrease in performance associated with a decrease in the duration of contraction and rate of tension development, indicating impaired cellular metabolism.\", \"answer_choice\": B}"]
