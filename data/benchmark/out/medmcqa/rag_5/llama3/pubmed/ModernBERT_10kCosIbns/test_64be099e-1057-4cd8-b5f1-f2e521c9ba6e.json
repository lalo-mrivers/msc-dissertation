["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the mechanisms of smooth muscle relaxation mediated by cyclic nucleotides. Cyclic GMP (cGMP) mediates the relaxing action of vasodilator drugs and substances, while cyclic AMP (cAMP) mediates relaxation by beta-adrenergic agonists. Both cGMP and cAMP reduce intracellular Ca2+ concentration in vascular smooth muscle cells, suggesting that they play a role in smooth muscle relaxation.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
