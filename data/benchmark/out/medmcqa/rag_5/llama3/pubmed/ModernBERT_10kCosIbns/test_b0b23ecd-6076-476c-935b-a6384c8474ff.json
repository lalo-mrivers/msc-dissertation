["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to the provided documents, disease-induced changes in volume of distribution (Vd) can result in a change in the therapeutic or toxic significance of a given plasma level. For example, a reduced Vd is seen in renal failure and is most likely for drugs that are eliminated by a renal excretory mechanism. Since the question mentions low apparent volume of distribution, we can infer that this refers to a disease-induced change in Vd. In this case, a low apparent volume of distribution indicates that the drug is not extensively distributed to tissue.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
