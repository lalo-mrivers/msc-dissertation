["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The provided documents describe studies on plaque formation. The first study mentions that a group of 12 individuals had a wide range in the thickness and content of plaque accumulations during equal time intervals. This suggests that the rate of plaque accumulation may vary among individuals. However, it does not provide specific information about when maximum accumulation takes place. The other documents describe various methods for studying plaque formation, but do not specifically mention Glickman or a timeframe for maximum accumulation. Therefore, we must rely on the first study to inform our answer.\", \"answer_choice\": A}"]
