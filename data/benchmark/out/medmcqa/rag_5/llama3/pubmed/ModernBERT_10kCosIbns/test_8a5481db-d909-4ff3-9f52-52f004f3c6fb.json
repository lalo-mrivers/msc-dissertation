["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the given documents, we know that neonatal morbidity among infants of diabetic mothers is high. We need to identify the complications in newborns of diabetic mothers except those mentioned in options A-D. From the study on congenital malformations, we can see that maternal alteration of hydrocarbonate metabolism may be related to troubles in the fetus and newborn. This suggests that hypocalcemia (option C) might be one of the complications. The same study also discusses the importance of normoglycemia at delivery to reduce neonatal hypoglycemia, which means hyperglycemia (option B) is unlikely to be a complication. The other options seem unrelated to neonatal morbidity among infants of diabetic mothers based on the provided documents.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
