["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient delivered a baby with normal expulsion of an intact placenta, but then started bleeding vaginally. On examination, she was hypotensive and a boggy mass is palpated per abdomen. USG showed retained placental tissues. This suggests that the placenta was left in situ after delivery, which is consistent with the case described in 'Retained abdominal placenta followed by angiography and ultrasound'. The patient's symptoms are also consistent with placental abruption, but the presence of a boggy mass per abdomen and the USG findings suggest that the placenta was not abnormally implanted. Therefore, the likely diagnosis is retained placenta.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"]
