["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the preganglionic parasympathetic fibers to the Otic ganglion. The pathway of parasympathetic nerve fibers to cerebral vessels from the otic ganglion in the rat is described. According to this study, the fibers leave the ganglion in the lesser superficial petrosal nerve, running on the anterior and medial inner surface of the tympanic bulla to reach the greater superficial petrosal nerve, and deviate via the deep petrosal nerve to the wall of the internal carotid artery. Therefore, the preganglionic parasympathetic fibers to the Otic ganglion are carried in the Lesser petrosal nerve.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
