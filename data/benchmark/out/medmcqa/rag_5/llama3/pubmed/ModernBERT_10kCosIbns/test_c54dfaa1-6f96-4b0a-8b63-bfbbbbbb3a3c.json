["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about what is NOT seen in the classical triad of megaloblastic anemia. In the provided documents, it is mentioned that patients with megaloblastic anaemia often present with macrocytosis or macroovalocytosis and neutrophil hypersegmentation. This suggests that the classical triad does not include Howell-Jolly bodies (which are actually a feature of hemolytic anemia). Reticulocytosis is mentioned as a possible finding in megaloblastic anaemia, but it is not specifically stated as part of the classical triad. Macro-ovalocytes and hypersegmented neutrophils are both features of megaloblastic anaemia. Therefore, the answer is A: Howell-Jolly bodies.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
