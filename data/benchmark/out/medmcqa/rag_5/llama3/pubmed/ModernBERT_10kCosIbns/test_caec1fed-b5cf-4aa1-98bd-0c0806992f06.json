["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the role of sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) in regulating the levels of sex steroids in plasma. The concentration of SHBG depends on various factors, including metabolic status, liver function, and gonad function. SHBG binds to receptor sites on plasma membranes with slow kinetics. When unliganded SHBG binds to its membrane receptor, it activates adenylate cyclase, increasing intracellular cAMP levels. This suggests that SHBG plays a role in regulating cell function.\n\nThe main physiological regulators of SHBG are sex steroids, particularly androgens. Androgens lower SHBG plasma levels, whereas estrogens increase them. In hyperandrogenic conditions, SHBG levels are often lower than normal, but may not be inversely correlated with androgen levels.\n\nNon-steroidal factors, such as insulin, can also affect SHBG levels. Low levels of SHBG were found in obese patients with or without hyperandrogenism or evidence of polycystic ovaries.\n\nConsidering the role of SHBG in regulating sex steroid levels and its interaction with cell membranes, it is likely that estrogen will be affected most after a change in SHBG.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
