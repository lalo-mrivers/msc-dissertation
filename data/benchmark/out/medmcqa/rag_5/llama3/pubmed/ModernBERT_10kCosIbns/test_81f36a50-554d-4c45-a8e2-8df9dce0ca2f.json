["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The citric acid cycle is a critical process that generates energy for the cell. The question asks about the high energy phosphate compound formed through substrate level phosphorylation. According to the relevant documents, the sequence of reactions in the tricarboxylic acid cycle involves the formation of succinyl-CoA which then gets converted to succinic acid and further to citrate. At this point, ATP is generated through substrate level phosphorylation.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
