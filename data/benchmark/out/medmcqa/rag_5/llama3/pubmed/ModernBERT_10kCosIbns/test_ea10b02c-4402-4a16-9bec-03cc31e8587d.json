["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the organ most resistant to GA. After reviewing the provided documents, I found that Galenia africana (GA) is a toxic plant material that causes liver and heart lesions in sheep and goats. The documents do not explicitly mention GA's effects on the brain or spinal cord. However, it can be inferred that the medulla oblongata and cerebrum are unlikely to be affected since they are part of the central nervous system and would likely require specific information about their response to GA. Based on this analysis, I am ruling out options B and D (Medulla oblonagata and Cerebrum). The remaining options, A (Spinal Cord) and C (Medullary cortex), both relate to parts of the central nervous system that could potentially be affected by GA. However, since there is no specific information provided about these organs' response to GA, I am leaning towards option A (Spinal Cord) being the most resistant to GA due to its possible structural protection.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
