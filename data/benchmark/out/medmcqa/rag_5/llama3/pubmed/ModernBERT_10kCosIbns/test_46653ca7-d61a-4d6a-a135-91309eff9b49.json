["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents discuss various indices of burden related to diseases. The paper 'Priorities in biomedical research' mentions five indices of the burden on services: inpatient days, outpatient referrals, consultations in family practice, sickness benefit, and loss of expectation of life. These indices were used to rank-order categories of disease for each burden. This suggests that a combination of multiple indicators may be necessary to fully capture the burden of different diseases.\n\nThe paper 'Health indexes and \"sanimetry\": conceptual aspects of recent research on the measurement of a population's state of health' discusses limitations of classical concepts of mortality and morbidity, and the introduction of disability measurements as an attempt to improve these aspects. This implies that disability is an important aspect of burden.\n\nThe paper 'Communicable disease mortality: now you see it, now you don't' proposes examining the cause-specific pattern of the entire mortality structure instead of restricting assessments to a limited number of leading causes of death. This suggests that overall burden should be considered rather than just focusing on individual diseases.\n\nThe paper 'The gross national health product: a proposed population health index' introduces the concept of the gross national health product (GNHP), which integrates mortality and disability data into a single number. This implies that GNHP could be used as an indicator of burden.\n\nIn conclusion, considering the discussion in these papers, Disability adjusted life years (D) seems to be a comprehensive index for measuring the burden of disease.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
