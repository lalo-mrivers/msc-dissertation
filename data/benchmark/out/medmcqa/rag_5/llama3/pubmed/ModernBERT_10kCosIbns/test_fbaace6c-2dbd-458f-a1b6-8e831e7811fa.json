["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The vasomotor responses to the Valsalva manoeuvre were examined in normal subjects and patients with diabetes mellitus. The response patterns are different for non-diabetic subjects and diabetics with postural hypotension. In non-diabetic subjects, an overshoot in systemic arterial pressure and a bradycardia after the manoeuvre are observed, along with forearm vasoconstriction or vasodilatation. Diabetics with postural hypotension show systemic arterial hypotension after the Valsalva manoeuvre with no significant change in forearm vascular resistance. The statement depicts vasomotor reversal of Dale refers to a situation where adrenaline (noradrenaline) is administered after phentolamine (a beta-blocker), which would cause a decrease in heart rate. Therefore, option C: Decrease in hea rate on adrenaline administration after phentolamine has been given represents the vasomotor reversal of Dale.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
