["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks which statement is not true about randomization. Randomization reduces confounding (A) by distributing the covariates evenly across groups. It decreases selection bias (B) by ensuring that the assignment of treatments is independent of patient characteristics.
