["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The provided documents describe the prenatal growth pattern of the human maxilla, which involves two pairs of accentuated growth areas (primary growth centers) that form the maxillary trapezoid. During the fetal period, the dimensional increase in the maxilla is documented and statistically analyzed. After 20 weeks of gestation, the growth of the maxilla is enhanced by the participation of intramembranous bone formation along the periphery. This suggests that normal growth of the maxilla occurs through a combination of primary growth centers and peripheral bone formation.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
