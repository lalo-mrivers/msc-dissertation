["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question mentions loss of lamina dura radiographically, which suggests a change in the supporting bone structure. High sound on percussion implies that there is still some attachment between the tooth and the surrounding tissues. Given these findings, I think it's likely that the type of resorption is related to the replantation process. The relevant document 'Replantation of avulsed teeth' mentions that calcium hydroxide can be useful in controlling resorption. This suggests that internal resorption might be a possibility. Additionally, the document 'Eleven-year follow-up of tooth replantation' notes that the periodontal membrane can be traced around the replanted central incisor, indicating functional attachment but not ankylosis.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
