["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the study on vertical facial heights, we can see that the ratio of Upper Anterior Facial Height to Total Anterior Facial Height remained constant (irrespective of sex). This means that the proportion of upper anterior facial height to total anterior facial height is consistent. Since there was no mention of a specific ratio for lower anterior facial height in this study, we cannot directly determine the ratio of upper anterior facial height to lower anterior facial height. However, based on the finding that the ratio of Upper Anterior Facial Height to Total Anterior Facial Height remained constant, it's reasonable to assume that the proportion of upper anterior facial height to total anterior facial height would be similar or identical for both anterior and posterior facial heights.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
