["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the first-order neuron of the visual pathway. The passage 'Representation of complex visual stimuli in the brain' describes how neurons in the lateral geniculate body (LGB) reduce a complex stimulus to its contours, and cortical cells only respond to contours either of a limited or of a wider range of orientations. This suggests that LGB is involved in processing visual information at an early stage. The passage 'Hierarchical and parallel mechanisms in the organization of visual cortex' also discusses the retino-geniculate-cortical pathway, which begins with ganglion cells, but it does not specifically mention the first-order neuron. Therefore, we can infer that LGB is likely to be involved.\", \"answer_choice\": C}"]
