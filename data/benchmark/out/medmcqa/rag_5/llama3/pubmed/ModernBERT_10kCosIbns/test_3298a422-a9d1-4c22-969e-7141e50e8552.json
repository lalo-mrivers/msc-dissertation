["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the limitation of distolingual extension of the mandibular impression for a complete denture. The relevant documents mention various muscles related to the mandible and dentures. Looking at the document 'The sublingual crescent extension and its relation to the stability and retention of mandibular complete dentures', it is stated that making the impression with minimal pressure on the floor of the mouth while the tongue is at rest allows greater mobility of the underlying muscles without denture dislodgment and without occlusion of the sublingual gland ducts. This suggests that the limitation of distolingual extension may be due to the action of these underlying muscles, specifically those related to the tongue's movement.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
