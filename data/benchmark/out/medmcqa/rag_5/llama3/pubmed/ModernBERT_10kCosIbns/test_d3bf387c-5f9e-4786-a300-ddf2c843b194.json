["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"After reviewing the documents, I found that none of them specifically mention the Temporo-mandibular ligament. However, they do provide information about the anatomy and function of the Temporo-mandibular joint (TMJ). The study [Muscular insertions on the temporo-mandibular disk. Physiologic implications] describes the direct and indirect muscular insertions on the temporomandibular meniscus, but it does not mention a specific ligament. Therefore, I will analyze the documents to see if they provide any information that could help identify where the Temporo-mandibular ligament is attached.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
