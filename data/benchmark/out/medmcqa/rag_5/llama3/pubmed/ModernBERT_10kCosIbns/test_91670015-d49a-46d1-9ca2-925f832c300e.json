["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the square root of pq/n. pq/n is a term that appears in binomial confidence limits. Specifically, it is the standard error of the proportion p. This can be found in the first document 'Simple SAS macros for the calculation of exact binomial and Poisson confidence limits'. The relevant text is: 'The exact binomial and Poisson confidence limits can be expressed very simply in terms of the inverse beta distribution... The standard error of p, sqrt(pq/n), plays a central role in these calculations.' Therefore, square root of pq/n indicates Standard error of proportions.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
