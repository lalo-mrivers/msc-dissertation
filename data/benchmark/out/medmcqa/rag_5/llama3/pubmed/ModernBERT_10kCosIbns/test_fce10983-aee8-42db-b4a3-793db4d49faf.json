["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"There is no direct information provided regarding maintaining parallelism between the object and film to avoid distortion. However, we can refer to general principles of radiography where it's known that increasing the target-to-object distance (TOD) can reduce magnification and distortions. This suggests that increasing the TOD would help maintain parallelism.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
