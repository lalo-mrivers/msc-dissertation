["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about which of the given options is a non-parametric test. A non-parametric test is one that does not require assumptions about the distribution of the data. The provided options are Pearson correlation, ANOVA, Student t-test, and Mann-Whitney test.\n\nPearson correlation and Student t-test are parametric tests as they rely on normality of data and equal variance between groups.\n\nANOVA is also a parametric test as it assumes normality of data and equal variance between groups.\n\nThe only non-parametric test among the given options is the Mann-Whitney test, which does not require any assumptions about the distribution of the data. Therefore, the correct answer is\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
