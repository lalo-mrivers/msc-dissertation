["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Firstly, I need to understand the concept of diarthroses. According to the provided documents, diarthrodial joints are important structural features that provide and limit the motions required for the joint. They are characterized by anatomic forms with a length scale of topographic variation ranging from 0.5 to 15 cm. Articular cartilage is the thin layer of hydrated soft tissue covering the articulating bony ends in diarthrodial joints.\n\nSince the question asks about all the following being diarthroses type of joint except, I need to identify what types of joints are mentioned in the documents. From the documents, I can see that diarthrodial joints develop by a sequence of cellular events leading to a full expression of the phenotypic characteristics. The classically described stages: cell condensation, three layered mesenchyme, vascular invasion and joint clefting, were chronologically recorded in all joints.\n\nThe document also mentions the development of appendicular synovial joints of both legs was studied with histological and histochemical techniques in 43 rat embryos aged 12 to 21 days. This suggests that synovial joints are a type of diarthrodial joint.\n\nFurthermore, the document on [Pathogenetic aspects of arthrosis and its therapeutic aspects] mentions articular cartilage as bradythrophic tissue which is subjected to continuous wear and tear.\n\nBased on this information, I can conclude that plane, symphyses, and saddle are not types of diarthroses. Symphyses refers to the fusion of bones at the joint, while plane and saddle refer to different types of joints. Therefore, the correct answer is B: Symphyses.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
