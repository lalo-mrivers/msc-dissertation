["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe HIV isolates obtained from HIV-infected patients and AIDS patients. The viruses were isolated using various methods such as immunofluorescence, enzyme immunoassay, reverse transcriptase activity, immunoblot, electron microscopy, and polymerase chain reaction.
