["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about Galeazzi's fracture dislocation. In the provided documents, there are two instances where Galeazzi fracture-dislocation is mentioned: one in 'A rare injury to the upper limb: elbow dislocation combined with Galeazzi fracture-dislocation.' and another in 'An uncommon fracture dislocation of the radius.'. The description in both cases suggests that Galeazzi fracture-dislocation involves a radial shaft fracture with a distal radioulnar joint (DRUJ) dislocation. Therefore, we can deduce that option C: Interosseous membrane tear with triangular fibro-cailage complex (TFCC) tear and ulnar shaft fracture is the correct answer.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
