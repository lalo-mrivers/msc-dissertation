["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The passage 'Super-elasticity and thermal behavior of Ni-Ti alloy orthodontic arch wires' mentions that some wires exhibited super-elasticity; load decreased little with decreasing deflection. Others showed good spring-back properties only; load was nearly proportional to deflection. The paper 'Advanced Chinese NiTi alloy wire and clinical observations' states that the Chinese NiTi wire had a low stiffness, high springback and constant bending and torsional moments on unloading, in a very large deformation region. It can produce a gentle, nearly constant force. This indicates that super-elastic wires have greater spring back than non-super-elastic wires.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
