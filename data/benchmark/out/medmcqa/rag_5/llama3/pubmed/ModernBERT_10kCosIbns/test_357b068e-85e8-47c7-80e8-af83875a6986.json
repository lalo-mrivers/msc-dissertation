["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about retaining an orthodontically treated midline diastema. The relevant documents mention the possibility of relapse after treatment. In 'The diastema, the frenum, the frenectomy: a clinical study', it is mentioned that there is a strong correlation between an 'abnormal' pretreatment frenum and a diastema. Additionally, it mentions that some cases may have a diastema without an 'abnormal' frenum. This suggests that the presence of a diastema does not guarantee relapse. However, in 'Surgical closure of diastema of central incisors', it is mentioned that one particular area which lends itself to relapse is the diastema between the incisors. This implies that some diastemas may be more prone to relapse than others.\n\nGiven this information, it can be inferred that a bonded lingual retainer would be the most effective option for retaining an orthodontically treated midline diastema, as it would provide continuous support and prevent relapse.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
