["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about incision given 2 cm below the border of mandible to preserve which nerve. We can analyze the relevant documents provided. The first document talks about surgical anatomy of the submandibular triangle and its contents, including four surgical planes and five nerves that need to be identified and spared. The third document discusses radical neck dissection and mentions removing or not removing the submandibular triangle contents depending on the primary site of cancer. None of these documents explicitly mention incision 2 cm below the border of mandible. However, we can look at the second document which compares two submandibular incisions on motor function of the lower lip. This study found that an inferior incision (lower level) had no facial nerve involvement compared to a conventional incision (50% facial nerve involvement). Since our question asks about preserving a specific nerve with an incision 2 cm below the border of mandible, we can deduce that this incision is likely trying to preserve the marginal mandibular nerve.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
