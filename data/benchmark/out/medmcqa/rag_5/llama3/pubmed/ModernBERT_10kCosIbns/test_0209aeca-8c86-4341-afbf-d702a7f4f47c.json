["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the provided documents, we can see that teeth affected by adult periodontitis (AP) are used as controls for comparison with prepubertal periodontitis (PP). We also know that all PP teeth showed a thick cuticle on the diseased cementum, whereas no similar structure was noted on the diseased cementum of the AP teeth. Additionally, we can see that in the clinical studies on juvenile, rapidly progressive and adult periodontitis before and after periodontal therapy, the first molars were the most frequently affected teeth followed by the incisors.
