["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, chronic glomerulonephritis is classified into two forms: smouldering and progressive. There are also subtypes of acute postinfectious glomerulonephritis with different histological patterns. In one of these studies, it was found that the 'starry sky' subtype had a lesser degree of cellular proliferation and leukocytosis in the glomeruli than the other subtypes. This suggests that the morphology of the glomerulus can influence the clinical course of the disease. The morphological and clinical course study showed that every form of glomerulonephritis has its individual prognosis, which can only be slightly influenced by therapy. It also found that the prognosis worsens when hypertension develops or tubular lesions occur. This information suggests that rapidly progressing glomerulonephritis (RPGN) may be characterized by a more aggressive cellular response and/or hypertension.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
