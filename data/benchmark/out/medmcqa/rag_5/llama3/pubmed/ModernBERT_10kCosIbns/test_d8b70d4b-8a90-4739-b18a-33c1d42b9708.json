["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about a difference in false positive results between two populations. This suggests that we should consider the concept of specificity, which is the proportion of true negatives among those who test negative. However, since the question is asking about false positives among those who test positive, we should focus on the predictive value positive (PV+). The PV+ is the proportion of true positives among those who test positive. If the PV+ is lower in population A compared to population B, it means that more of the positive tests in population A are actually false positives. This could be due to a higher specificity of the test in population A, which would result in fewer false positive results.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
