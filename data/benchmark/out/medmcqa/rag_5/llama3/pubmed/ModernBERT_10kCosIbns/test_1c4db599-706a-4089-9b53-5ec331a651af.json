["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents provide information about calcification processes in various organisms and tissues. The question asks about enzymes involved in calcification. While the documents mention calcification, they do not specifically discuss enzymes. However, one document does mention a 'calcification initiator protein' (CIP) that is involved in bone matrix calcification. This suggests that proteins or enzymes may play a role in calcification processes. Based on this information, it appears that the correct answer involves alkaline phosphatase, which is known to be an enzyme involved in calcification.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
