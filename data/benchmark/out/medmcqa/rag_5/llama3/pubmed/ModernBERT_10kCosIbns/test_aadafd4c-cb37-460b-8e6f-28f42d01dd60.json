["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about a patient who failed to show pupillary constriction after topical administration of 1% Pilocarpine. The papers provided earlier discuss the effects of pilocarpine on intraocular pressure and aqueous humor dynamics. In one study, it was noted that pilocarpine caused a significant increase in pseudofacility, which is a clinically useful drug effect not previously reported. This suggests that pilocarpine can have different effects on pupils, depending on the individual. One possible reason for failure to produce pupillary constriction could be subsensitivity to pilocarpine due to prior treatment. Another possibility is Adie's tonic pupil, which is characterized by a large, dilated pupil.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
