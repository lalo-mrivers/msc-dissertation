["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the potential generated due to movement of freely diffusible ions across a semi-permeable membrane. From the provided documents, we can see that none of them directly mention 'Nemst equation', 'Gibbs equation', or 'Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz equation'. However, from 'Energetics of permeation of thin lipid membranes by ions' document, we can infer that the potential is related to the energy of an ion in a thin hydrocarbon membrane relative to its energy in a bulk aqueous phase. This suggests that the Fick principle might be relevant.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
