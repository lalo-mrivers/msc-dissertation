["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the lateral movement of the condyle. From the provided documents, we know that the protrusive movement of the temporomandibular joint is characterized by neuromuscular coordination and the shape of the protrusive condyle path is like a section of parabola curved forward and downward. In laterotrusion, the 'active' condyle moves on a straight line towards the front and downward, while the relatively 'resting' condyle describes a shortened path corresponding to the initial part of an opening movement. This suggests that the lateral movement of the condyle is caused by the neuromuscular coordination and the contralateral lateral pterygoid muscle.\", \"answer_choice\": C}"]
