["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe congenital ossicular anomalies without malformations of the external ear. The classification for these anomalies suggests that incudostapedial joint separation results from failure in building up 'the secondary continuity', malleus and/or incus fixation is due to disturbances in the separation process by undifferentiated mesenchyme, and stapes fixation is due to maldevelopment of the stapedial lamina. The most common type of congenital ossicular dysfunction can be inferred from this classification.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
