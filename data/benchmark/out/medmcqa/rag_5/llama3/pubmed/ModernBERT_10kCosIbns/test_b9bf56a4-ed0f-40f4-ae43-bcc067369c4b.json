["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents describe various properties and effects on orthodontic wires. Permanent bending during clinical application can cause work hardening of the alloy. According to the document 'Tensile properties of orthodontic wire', stress relaxation occurs in some orthodontic wires loaded initially to 20 kg over a period of 3 days. This suggests that the wire may undergo changes in its internal structure due to repeated bending, which could lead to work hardening. The document 'Reduction in the modulus of elasticity in orthodontic wires' also mentions that severe cold drawing can result in a lower modulus of elasticity. This could be related to the process of work hardening.\n\nThe document 'Effect of bonded gold inlays on fracture resistance of teeth' does not directly relate to the question, but it provides information on the effects of repeated loading and unloading on materials.\n\nBased on these findings, the most likely outcome of permanent bending of an orthodontic wire during its clinical application is work hardening, which could lead to internal stresses, a decrease in ductility, and potentially even increase in strength.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: All of the above\""]
