["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The main difference between low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) and unfractionated heparin is the anti-IIa activity. Unfractionated heparin has a 1:1 ratio of anti-Xa to anti-IIa, while LMWH has a higher ratio of anti-Xa to anti-IIa due to the depolymerization process. This means that LMWH has less anti-IIa activity, which is associated with the risk of hemorrhage. Therefore, LMWH has reliable anticoagulant action because it dissociates anti-IIa activity from anti-Xa activity.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
