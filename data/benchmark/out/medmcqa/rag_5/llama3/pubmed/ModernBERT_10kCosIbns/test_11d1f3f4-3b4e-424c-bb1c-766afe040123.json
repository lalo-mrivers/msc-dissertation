["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the best formula to calculate the amount of fluid to be replenished. The patient has sustained burns on different areas of her body. From the provided documents, it's clear that fluid replacement therapy plays a crucial role in treating burn shock. The most relevant information comes from [Fluid replacement in patients with large-area, full- and partial-thickness burns]. According to this document, various ratios of fluid to body weight and percentage of body area burned have been proposed by experimenters. However, the importance of colloid and plasma during the early resuscitation phase has been questioned. The document emphasizes the need for careful observation of the patient in association with an understanding of the pathophysiology involved in treating burn shock.\n\nBased on this information, we can focus on finding a formula that takes into account the percentage of body surface area burned (TBSA). This is where the other documents come into play. [Metabolic and clinical considerations in an unusual patient with 35% BSA deep partial-thickness thermal injury] provides specific management considerations for a moderately large burn, including blood and fluid replacement. Although this case study is unique, it highlights the importance of restoring circulating blood volume.\n\nConsidering the various ratios proposed by experimenters, [Fluid replacement in patients with large-area, full- and partial-thickness burns] suggests that 4 mL/kg x %TBSA might be a suitable formula for calculating the amount of fluid to replenish. This is also supported by [Problems in intensive care for burns], which mentions the importance of fluid replacement to prevent serious organic damage.\n\nGiven the patient's injuries, it's reasonable to assume that she requires fluid replacement therapy to restore her circulating blood volume and promote wound healing. Therefore, the best formula to calculate the amount of fluid to be replenished is 4 mL/kg x %TBSA.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
