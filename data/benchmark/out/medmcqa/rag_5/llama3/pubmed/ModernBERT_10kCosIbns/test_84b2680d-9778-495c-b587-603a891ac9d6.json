["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the microorganism previously present in periapical tissues following obturation. In the given documents, we have a study that examined 58 periapical lesions and found bacteria in 51 of them. The cultures were positive for the presence of bacteria in those cases, but bacteria were seen histologically in only 8 of 58 cases. This suggests that bacteria may not always be visible on histology, but they can still be present. Furthermore, we have another study that states that bacteria, foreign material, missed canals, vertical root fractures, and periodontal disease may all contribute to the chronic, non-healing periradicular lesion.\n\nConsidering this information, it is likely that the microorganism previously present in periapical tissues following obturation would be eliminated by the natural defenses. This is because obturation is a treatment aimed at removing the infection from the root canal and preventing bacteria from re-entering the canal.\", \n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
