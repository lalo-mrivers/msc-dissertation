["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the types of impression materials used. From the provided documents, it can be inferred that heavy and light body impression materials are related to alginate impression materials. The documents mention that alginate impression materials have a long working time and small variation in elastic modulus during setting. This suggests that heavy and light body impression materials may refer to different consistencies of alginate materials. Therefore, the answer should relate to alginate impression materials.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
