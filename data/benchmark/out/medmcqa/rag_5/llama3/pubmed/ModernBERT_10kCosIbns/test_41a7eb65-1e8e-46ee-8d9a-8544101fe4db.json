["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the potential effect of adding verapamil to a patient already taking metoprolol. Metoprolol is a beta blocker. Verapamil also has beta blocking effects. The key is to find where in the documents it mentions an interaction between verapamil and metoprolol, or any other relevant information that would help answer this question. In the 'Verapamil in the management of hypertensive patients' document, it mentions that verapamil was substituted for initial drugs, including beta blockers, with a marked reduction in side-effects. This suggests that adding verapamil to a patient already taking a beta blocker like metoprolol might lead to reduced side-effects. There is no mention of any specific arrhythmias or adverse effects related to this combination.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
