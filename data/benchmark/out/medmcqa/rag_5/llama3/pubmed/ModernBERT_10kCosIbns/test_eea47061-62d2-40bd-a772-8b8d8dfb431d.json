["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"When two screening tests are done in series, the sensitivity of the first test will determine which individuals move on to the second test. The second test then acts as a confirmatory test for those who tested positive in the first test. This means that any errors or false positives from the first test are eliminated by the second test. As a result, the specificity of the combined tests increases. At the same time, the sensitivity of the combined tests also increases because the second test provides an additional chance to detect individuals with the characteristic. Therefore, when two screening tests are done in series, we see an increase in both sensitivity and specificity.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C: Increased sensitivity and increased specificity\""]
