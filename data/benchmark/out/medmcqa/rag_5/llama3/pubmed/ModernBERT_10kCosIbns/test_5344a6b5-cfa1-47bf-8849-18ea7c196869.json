["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant document is 'Vulcanism, mercury-sensitized photo-reactions and abiogenetic synthesis: a theoretical treatment.' This article discusses the properties of Periodic Group IIb elements, particularly Hg, as they relate to ultra-violet sensitization in organic chemical reactions. The energy levels of 6(1) P1 and 6(3) P1 resonance states and the high vapor pressure of Hg bring it within the range of bond dissociation energies in most organic molecules and many inorganics. This article proposes that Hg-sensitized ultraviolet photo-reactions may have played a significant part in abiogenetic organic synthesis on the primitive earth.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
