["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To estimate the prevalence of disease in a population, we need to use the paper 'The estimation of disease frequency using a population sample'. This paper provides a method for estimating disease frequency using a population sample. We also have the report on reported patients with infectious diseases in 1990, which gives us an idea of the actual number of cases. However, our goal is to estimate prevalence within a certain range (45-55%) with 95% confidence. Therefore, we need to apply the statistical theory from the paper to determine the minimum sample size required for the study.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
