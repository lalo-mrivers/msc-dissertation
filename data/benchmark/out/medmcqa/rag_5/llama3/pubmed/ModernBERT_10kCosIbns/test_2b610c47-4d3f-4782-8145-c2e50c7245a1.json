["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the function of reciprocal clasp arm. The given documents are related to various aspects of prostheses and dentures, including retention, grip strength, stress distribution within circumferential clasp arms, and mechanisms of the clasp-knife reflex. However, none of these directly address the specific function of a reciprocal clasp arm. Instead, we need to analyze the provided information about clasps and their interactions with prostheses. The [Relationship between clasp force and retention] document mentions the importance of adequate functional formation of constructed crowns for clasp teeth in optimizing clasp retention. This suggests that clasp arms may play a role in achieving optimal retention. Similarly, the [Stress distribution within circumferential clasp arms] study highlights the importance of stress distributions within clasp arms and their potential impact on clasp failure. Finally, the [Mechanisms of the clasp-knife reflex] document discusses the mechanisms underlying the clasp-knife reflex in an animal model, which may provide some insights into how clasp arms interact with prostheses.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
