["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the accumulation of a substance in the brain of a child with Zellweger syndrome. Based on the provided documents, we know that one of the characteristic features of Zellweger syndrome is the presence of globoid cells and glial nodules in the gray matter, as well as degeneration of the white matter. Additionally, there are reports of fatty change in astrocytes and diffuse gliosis.\n\nOne of the key features of Zellweger syndrome is the absence of peroxisomes, which can be confirmed using histochemical staining for catalase. This suggests that the metabolism of very long chain fatty acids (VLCFA) may be affected.\n\nAccording to the documents, one of the characteristic findings in Zellweger syndrome is the accumulation of glial nodules and globoid cells in the brain. These structures are not directly related to glucose, lactic acid, or triglycerides.\n\nTherefore, it is likely that the answer is C: Long chain fatty acid.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
