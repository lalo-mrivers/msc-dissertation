["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to the provided documents, the movement involved in opening the mouth is discussed in 'Mastication and swallowing: an overview'. The document explains that during jaw opening, the antero-posterior movements of the tongue are much greater; this alters the time and rate at which the jaw opens. This suggests that translation is involved in the opening of the mouth. Additionally, the document also mentions that the pattern of jaw movement during closing and during opening consequently varies with food consistency, implying a hinge (rotation) movement. Therefore, it can be inferred that both translation and hinge movements are involved in the opening of the mouth.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
