["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks which one of the options does not classify as locally advanced breast cancer. The relevant documents mention various criteria for locally advanced breast cancer (LABC). According to 'Factors affecting outcome in locally advanced breast cancer', LABC can be characterized by clinical stage, pathological stage, oestrogen receptor status, and type of therapy. However, 'Late diagnosis of advanced breast cancer--a challenge for health services' provides more specific criteria, including tumour size greater than or equal to 5 cm (T3) or T4, metastasis within 4 months, pathological diagnosis pT3, pT4 or pN2.\n\nComparing the options provided with these criteria, A: Tumour more than 4cm is a possible characteristic of LABC, but not the only one. B: Inflammatory breast cancer and C: Chest wall involvement are also mentioned as features of LABC in other documents. D: Skin involvement can occur due to the progression of LABC.\n\nTherefore, it appears that none of the options provided exclusively classify as locally advanced breast cancer.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
