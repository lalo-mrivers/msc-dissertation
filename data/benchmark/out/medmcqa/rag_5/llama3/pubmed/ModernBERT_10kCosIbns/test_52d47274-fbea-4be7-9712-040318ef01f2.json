["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, most of the clinical staphylococcal cultures were highly resistant to beta-lactamase sensitive antibiotics. It was supposed that these strains possessed penicillinase plasmids, since all the cultures tested had penicillinase activity and were resistant to benzylpenicillin. These cultures possessing penicillinase plasmids belonged mainly to the phage group III and were polylysogenic. Additionally, some of the strains were tolerant for cloxacillin but not tolerant for clindamycin and gentamicin. Penicillin-tolerant staphylococci showed a high degree of synergism between gentamicin and cloxacillin or cephalothin and gentamicin.\n\nThe study on susceptibility patterns of Staphylococcus aureus in a family practice population found that only 25.7 percent of the isolates were sensitive to penicillin G and ampicillin, but most isolates were sensitive to tetracycline and erythromycin. The study also concluded that penicillin G should not be used in the treatment of S aureus infections.\n\nThe resistance of staphylococci to penicillin-G and cloxacillin was studied, and it was found that 4-7% of Staphylococcus aureus strains were sensitive to Penicillin-G; 40-41% were sensitive to Cloxacillin. Most isolates were resistant to penicillin-G, but sensitive to gentamicin.\n\nThe response of Staphylococcus aureus to benzylpenicillin was investigated in vitro, and it was found that the growth and division of cells continued for up to 1 h in the presence of penicillin. On addition of penicillinase to cultures exposed to penicillin, there was a time interval before survivors began to divide.\n\nConsidering these findings, if the infection involves non-penicillinase-producing staphylococcus, the drug of choice would be\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B: Erythromycin\""]
