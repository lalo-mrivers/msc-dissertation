["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has steroid-dependent nephrotic syndrome for the last 5 years. The patient is markedly cushingoid with blood pressure of 120/86 mmHg and small subcapsular cataracts. This indicates that the patient has severe side effects from corticosteroids. Steroid-resistant disease is unlikely, as the patient's disease responds to steroids.\n\nThe relevant documents suggest that patients with frequent relapses and severe corticosteroid side effects may benefit from cytotoxic agents like cyclophosphamide, which can provide long-term remission. In this case, options B and D are not suitable because the patient is already steroid-dependent.\n\nOption A (longterm frusemide with enalapril) is also not suitable as it would continue to rely on corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive agents.\n\nOption C (intravenous immunoglobulin) is not directly related to the patient's condition and may not address the underlying disease.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate therapy of choice is None of the above.\", \"answer_choice\": \"None of the above\"}"]
