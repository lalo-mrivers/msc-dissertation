["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the initiation of contraction in skeletal muscles. The relevant documents describe muscle function, adaptations to growth and exercise, and metabolic potentials of skeletal muscles. Fiber types and metabolic potentials are mentioned, but they don't directly relate to the initiation of contraction. Clinical assessment of skeletal muscle function mentions force generated at different frequencies of stimulation, which implies that contraction is initiated by electrical impulses from motor nerves. Needle biopsy provides access to muscle for diagnosis, studies of chemical energy exchange, and correlation of function and metabolism with constituent muscle fiber types, but it doesn't provide information about the initiation of contraction. Activity patterns of human skeletal muscles describe muscle activity recorded continuously for 8-hour periods, which implies that contraction is initiated by neural signals. Therefore, the answer lies in understanding how neural signals trigger muscle contractions.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
