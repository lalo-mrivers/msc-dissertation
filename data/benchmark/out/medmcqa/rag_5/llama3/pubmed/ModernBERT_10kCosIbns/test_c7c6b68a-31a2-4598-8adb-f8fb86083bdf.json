["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents provide information about metformin's pharmacokinetics, therapeutic use, and comparison with phenformin. According to the first document, metformin is effective in maturity-onset diabetes both as monotherapy and in combination with a sulphonylurea. It reduces blood glucose levels without causing significant hypoglycaemia and tends to induce weight reduction. The pharmacokinetic studies show that metformin is eliminated through active secretion by the kidney (mean renal clearance, 440.8 ml/min) and is not bound to plasma proteins. The documents do not mention any effects of metformin on cellular respiration in mitochondria or its use in decompensated heart failure. Furthermore, there is no evidence that metformin inhibits hepatic glucose production. Therefore, the correct answer must be related to a false statement about metformin.\", \"answer_choice\": D}"]
