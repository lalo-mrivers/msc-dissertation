["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents discuss cold agglutinins (CA) as circulating antibodies capable of erythrocyte agglutination. The CA immunoglobulins are reviewed, and the significance of subgroup preferences and cross-idiotypic specificities is discussed. In one report, an agglutinin with different specificities at different temperatures was present, which suggests that CA can be directed against antigens of the I/i system. Therefore, considering the characteristics and properties of cold agglutinins described in the documents, it is likely that CA is IgM.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
