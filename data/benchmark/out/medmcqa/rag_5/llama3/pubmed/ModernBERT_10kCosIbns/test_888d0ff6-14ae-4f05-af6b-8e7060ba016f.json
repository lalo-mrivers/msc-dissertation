["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking which hormone is controlled by feedforward control. The first document discusses feedback regulation of nephron filtration rate during pharmacologic interference with the renin-angiotensin and adrenergic systems in rats. It explains that tubuloglomerular feedback has been defined as a mechanism in which changes in distal tubular sodium chloride delivery induce changes in glomerular arteriolar resistance. However, this does not directly relate to feedforward control. The second document discusses metabolic feedback in mammalian endocrine systems and explains the concept of feedback loops. It mentions that products of catabolism and anabolism may themselves participate in the feedback process in either a feed-forward or feedback manner. This suggests that some hormones might be controlled by feedforward mechanisms. However, it does not provide specific examples.\n\nThe third document discusses coupled sodium-chloride influx across brush border of flounder intestine and has no relevance to hormonal control or feedforward mechanisms. The fourth document discusses biofeedback control of systemic arterial pressure and also has no direct relation to the question.\n\nAfter reviewing all the documents, I conclude that there is limited information provided about specific hormones controlled by feedforward mechanisms. However, based on the general concept of feedback loops and metabolic processes discussed in the second document, I would assume that some hormones might be controlled by feedforward mechanisms.\n\nTherefore, my answer would be B: Insulin, as it is mentioned to directly inhibit activity of several different endocrine pathways, which could be interpreted as a feedforward mechanism.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
