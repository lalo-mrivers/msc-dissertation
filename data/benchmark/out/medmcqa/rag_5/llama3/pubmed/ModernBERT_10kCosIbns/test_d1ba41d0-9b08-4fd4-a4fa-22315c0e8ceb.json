["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the properties of myelinated nerve fibers. From the provided documents, we can see that myelinated nerve fibers have a characteristic structure with nodes of Ranvier where depolarization occurs. The size distribution of external fiber and axon diameters is also mentioned in one of the documents. However, there is no information about the conduction velocity of myelinated nerve fibers compared to non-myelinated fibers or the composition of their outer layer. Therefore, option A can be excluded as it is not supported by any relevant document.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
