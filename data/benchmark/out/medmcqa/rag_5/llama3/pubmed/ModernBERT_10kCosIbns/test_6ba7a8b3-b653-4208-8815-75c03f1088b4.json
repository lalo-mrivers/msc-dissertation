["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the provided documents, we can see that formalin is a fixative substance. In [Bactericidal action of formalin on the causative agent of plague], it's mentioned that formalin exerts its fixing effect on tissues in 3-4 days.

Additionally, [Effect of intravesical formalin on the urothelium] mentions that varying degrees of cystitis may be seen in the urinary bladder of rabbits subjected to 10% formaldehyde instillation for periods ranging from 15 to 90 min, which implies that formalin can cause damage to tissues.
