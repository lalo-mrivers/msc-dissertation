["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the characteristics of limbal epithelial cells and their stem cells. The basal layer of the limbal epithelium contains stem cells that are responsible for cell production under steady-state conditions. Recent concepts on stem cells in epidermis, intestinal crypt, and oral mucosa suggest that these cells may be present throughout life and are essential for all cell production. This information can be applied to oral epithelia in an attempt to explain some of the changes observed. The documents also describe microspectrophotometric studies of DNA distribution in oral lesions, which can provide insights into the characteristics of stem cells. Characteristics of magnetically separated rat tracheal epithelial cell populations suggest that basal cells are most likely the stem cells of the tracheal epithelium.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
