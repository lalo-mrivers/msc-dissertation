["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a nurse with MRSA colonization of anterior nares. This suggests that the infection is likely hospital-acquired, rather than community-acquired. The patient's occupation as a nurse also increases the risk of transmission to others. Given the potential for person-to-person transmission, it is important to prevent further spread of the infection. Topical antibiotics such as bacitracin may not be effective in eliminating the infection, and oral vancomycin may not be necessary since the colonization is localized to the anterior nares. Inhaled colistin may also not be effective in this case. IV cefazolin has been shown to be effective in preventing MRSA infections in other studies.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
