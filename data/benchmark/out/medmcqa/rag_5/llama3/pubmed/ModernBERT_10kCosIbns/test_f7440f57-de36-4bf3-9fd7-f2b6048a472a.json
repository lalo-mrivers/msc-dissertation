["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, glucocorticoids are known to have anti-inflammatory effects. According to 'Glucocorticoids and infection', pharmacologic doses of steroids can inhibit each step of phagocytic-micro-organism interaction, including chemotaxis, recognition and opsonization, phagocytosis, membrane fusion, and degranulation. Additionally, steroid alteration of post-phagocytic superoxide production, hydrogen peroxide generation, and prostaglandin and thromboxane synthesis is also described. This information suggests that glucocorticoids may interfere with the killing of microorganisms, which could contribute to their anti-inflammatory effects.\", \"answer_choice\": B}"]
