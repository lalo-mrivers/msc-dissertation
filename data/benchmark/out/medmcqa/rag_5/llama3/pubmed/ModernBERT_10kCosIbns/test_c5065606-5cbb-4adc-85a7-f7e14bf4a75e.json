["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"There is no specific mention of the repair process after micro-needle inseion in the provided documents. However, based on the information about the development of skin interfacing cannula and the reaction of cerebral cortex to chronically implanted plastic needles, it can be inferred that the repair process may involve the interaction between cells and adjacent monofilament fibers (as mentioned in the development of skin interfacing cannula) or the formation of reactive astrocytes around a foreign body (as mentioned in the reaction of cerebral cortex to chronically implanted plastic needles).\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
