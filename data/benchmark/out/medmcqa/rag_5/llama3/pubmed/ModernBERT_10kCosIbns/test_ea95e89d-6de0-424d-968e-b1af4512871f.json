["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To calculate the absolute risk reduction (ARR), we need to find the difference between the control group (old drug) and the intervention group (new drug). For developed HT complications, the control group has 1800 cases out of 15225 total subjects, while the intervention group has 1620 cases. So the ARR is (1800 - 1620) / 15225 = 1%. For did not develop HT complications, the control group has 13425 cases and the intervention group has 13560 cases. The ARR for this outcome is also 1%.\n\nTo calculate the relative risk (RR), we need to divide the proportion of developed HT complications in the intervention group by the proportion in the control group. For developed HT complications, the proportions are (1620/15225) and (1800/15225). So RR = (1620/15225) / (1800/15225) = 0.9.\n\nThe other options do not accurately represent the ARR and RR values.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
