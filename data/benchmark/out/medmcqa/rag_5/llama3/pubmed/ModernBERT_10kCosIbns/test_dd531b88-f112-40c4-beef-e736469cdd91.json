["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, particularly 'Categories of axons in mammalian rami communicantes' and 'Categories of axons in mammalian rami communicantes. Part II', it is clear that grey rami communicates consist of post-ganglionic sympathetics (approximately 3,000 to 5,000 unmyelinated axons) and sensory axons (4 to 5 myelinated and 20 to 25 unmyelinated). Therefore, option D: Fibres are non-myelinated is the correct answer.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
