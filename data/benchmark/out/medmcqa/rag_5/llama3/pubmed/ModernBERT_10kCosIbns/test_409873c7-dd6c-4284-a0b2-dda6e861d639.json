["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks for a characteristic feature of staphylococcus food poisoning that is except. The key to this question lies in the provided documents. Specifically, we can find information about Staphylococcus aureus and its characteristics from the first document 'Staphylococcal food poisoning from infected snoek'. From this document, we know that S. aureus was found on snoek samples with counts of 200 000 per gram. This suggests that the bacteria are present in large numbers before arrival at the butchery and that they grow as a result of mishandling after processing. We also find information about Staphylococcus aureus food poisoning from other documents, such as 'Evaluation of staphylococcal food contamination in four different culture media' which highlights the importance of proper handling to prevent growth. The last document 'Relation of intrahospital morbidity from staphylococcal infections to some properties of hospital strains' provides further insight into the characteristics of Staphylococcus aureus and its relation to infection severity.\n\nBased on this information, we can conclude that the characteristic feature of staphylococcus food poisoning that is except is option A. Optimum temperature for toxin production is 37Â°C. This option seems unrelated to the characteristics of S. aureus food poisoning mentioned in the documents.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
