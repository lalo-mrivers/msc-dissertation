["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about statements regarding influenza vaccine. We need to find the correct statement among the options. First, we should look for information related to secondary attack rate. According to the first document, vaccination of schoolchildren with an inactivated H3N2 vaccine resulted in a three-fold reduction in the attack rate for the entire community. This implies that the secondary attack rate might be higher than 5-15%. Therefore, option A is not correct.\n\nThe second statement asks about virus shedding before symptoms appear. The relevant document does not provide information on this topic, so we cannot make an inference.\n\nThe third statement concerns the high-risk age group. The first document states that individuals in the high-risk group are mainly elderly, and the elderly have a low frequency of influenza infection. This implies that the high-risk age group is likely older than 1-5 years. Therefore, option C is not correct.\n\nFinally, we look at the fourth statement regarding aquatic birds as reservoirs. The relevant document does not provide information on this topic, so we cannot make an inference.\n\nIn conclusion, none of the statements provided match the information available in the documents.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"None of the above (not A, B, C, or D)\""]
