["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for the surest sign of a cyanotic spell in a child with tetralogy of Fallot. The relevant documents mention that the mechanism of cyanotic spells in tetralogy of Fallot is not clear, but one hypothesis suggests that mechanoreceptor stimulation from the right ventricle may trigger reflexes resulting in hyperventilation and peripheral vasodilation without bradycardia, which may initiate a spell. This information does not provide specific signs of cyanotic spells, so we need to look for other clues. The document 'Prognosis in fetal tetralogy of Fallot' mentions that patients with prenatal diagnosis have a higher mortality rate compared to those diagnosed postnatally or treated surgically. The document 'Staged surgical management of tetralogy of Fallot in infants' discusses the importance of staging surgery and the impact of anatomic features on survival rates. The document '[The EEG of patients with tetralogy of Fallot with and without hypoxemic seizures]' suggests that electroencephalographic findings suggest early corrective surgery.\n\nHowever, none of these documents provide specific signs or symptoms of cyanotic spells. Therefore, we need to look for other relevant information. One possible clue is the 'Mechanism of cyanotic spells in tetralogy of Fallot--the missing link?' document, which suggests that hyperventilation and some peripheral vasodilation without bradycardia may be part of a reflex resulting from mechanoreceptor stimulation.\n\nBased on this information, it seems that Aerial oxygen saturation of less than 75% (D) could be a possible sign of cyanotic spell. However, we need to consider other options as well.\", \n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
