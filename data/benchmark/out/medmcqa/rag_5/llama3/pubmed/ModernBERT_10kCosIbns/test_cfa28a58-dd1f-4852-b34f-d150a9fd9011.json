["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks for a false statement about snake-bites. The relevant documents mention various types of venomous snakes, their effects on the nervous system, and treatment options. Based on this information, I will analyze each option to find the false statement.\n\nOption A: Anti-venom is not effective in humpnosed pit viper bite. This statement seems plausible since there is no specific mention of anti-venom effectiveness for a particular species of snake in the provided documents.\n\nOption B: Cobra venom is neurotoxic. The second document mentions that elapid venoms, which include cobra venom, act principally at the neuromuscular junction and produce a flaccid paralysis of voluntary muscles. This suggests that cobra venom is indeed neurotoxic, making this statement true.\n\nOption C: Atropine premedication should be used before administering Neostigmine. The documents do not mention atropine or its use with neostigmine. Since there is no relevant information about these drugs in the provided texts, it seems that this statement might be false.\n\nOption D: Neostigmine has a role in krait bite. Although neostigmine is mentioned as an option for treating myasthenia gravis and snake envenomation, there is no specific mention of its use in krait bites. The documents do not provide sufficient information to confirm or deny the effectiveness of neostigmine in krait bites.\n\nBased on this analysis, I conclude that Option C: Atropine premedication should be used before administering Neostigmine is the false statement about snake-bites.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
