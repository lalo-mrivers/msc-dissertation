["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents mention nonionizing radiation and its effects on human health. The provided question asks about the effect of radiation, which seems to be referring to ionizing radiation based on the discussion in the documents. The documents discuss various types of radiation, including photon radiation sources, megavoltage photon radiation sources, irradiation of cells by single and double pulses of high intensity radiation, and skin reactions after different fractionation schedules giving the same cumulative radiation effect. This information suggests that the effects of radiation are not directly related to genetic make-up of individuals (choice D). The documents also discuss build-up region of megavoltage photon radiation sources, which indicates that radiation can have cumulative effects (choice A) rather than being fractionalized or concentrated.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
