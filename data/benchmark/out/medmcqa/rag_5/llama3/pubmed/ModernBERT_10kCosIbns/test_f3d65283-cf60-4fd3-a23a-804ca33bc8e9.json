["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the capillary oncotic pressure that would allow a net filtration pressure of 3 mm Hg, we need to calculate the interstitial fluid pressure. The interstitial hydrostatic pressure is 2 mm Hg and the interstitial oncotic pressure is 7 mm Hg, so the total interstitial pressure is 9 mm Hg. Since there is a capillary hydrostatic pressure of 25 mm Hg, we need to subtract this from the total interstitial pressure to get the net filtration pressure. This gives us 16 mm Hg (9 - 25). To allow a net filtration pressure of 3 mm Hg, we would add this amount to the interstitial fluid pressure, which gives us 12 mm Hg. Since the capillary oncotic pressure is the difference between the interstitial and capillary hydrostatic pressures, we can calculate it by subtracting the interstitial pressure from the capillary pressure. This gives us 25 - 12 = 13 mm Hg.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
