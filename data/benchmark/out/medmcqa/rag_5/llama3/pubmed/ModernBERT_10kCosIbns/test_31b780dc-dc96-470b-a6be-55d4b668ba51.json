["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents discuss the properties of glucosamine, a naturally occurring compound found in the human body. It has been tested for its anti-inflammatory activities and has shown to protect against certain types of edema and pleuritis, but not against specific inflammation mediators such as bradykinin or serotonin. Glucosamine also did not show antinociceptive properties against writhing provoked by i.p. phenylquinone in the mouse. The potency of glucosamine on anti-inflammatory tests was lower than that of acetylsalicylic acid and much lower than that of indomethacin. Its acute toxicity, however, and notably the toxicity on the gastrointestinal tract is very low, practically absent. Glucosamine has been shown to inhibit in vitro superoxide generation and lysosomal enzymes of the liver. The pharmacological therapeutic index of glucosamine with regard to its anti-inflammatory activities seems comparable or superior to that of known non-steroidal anti-inflammatories.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
