["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the creation of arch space for eruption of 2nd & 3rd molar. We can look at the documents provided to find information about the development and formation of these molars. From the [Clinico-statistical study of the period of formation and mineralization of the 3d molar], we know that the third molar may form between the 6th and 13th year of life. This suggests that the arch space for eruption of the 2nd & 3rd molar would likely be created by resorption of the anterior border of ramus, as this is a process that occurs during the development of the dental arches.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
