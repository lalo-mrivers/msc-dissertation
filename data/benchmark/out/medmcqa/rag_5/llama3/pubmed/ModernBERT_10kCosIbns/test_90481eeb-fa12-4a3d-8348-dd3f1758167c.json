["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the effects of starvation on glucose metabolism. The study by Effect of starvation on renal metabolism in the rat shows that renal cortical slices from starved rats have increased gluconeogenic capacity when incubated with various substrates, including pyruvate. Additionally, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase activity is increased in renal cortical tissue from starved rats. This suggests that pyruvate plays a key role in gluconeogenesis during starvation. The study by Physiologic significance of glucocorticoids and insulin in the regulation of hepatic gluconeogenesis during starvation in rats shows that adrenalectomy does not affect the hepatic gluconeogenic response to starvation, suggesting that glucocorticoids do not play a significant role in this process. Therefore, it is likely that pyruvate carboxylase plays a key role in gluconeogenesis during starvation.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
