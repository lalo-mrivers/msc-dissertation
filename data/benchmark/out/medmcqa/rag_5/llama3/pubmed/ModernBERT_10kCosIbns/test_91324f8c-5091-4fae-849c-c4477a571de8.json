["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents provide information on the effects of intravenous (IV) diazepam. IV diazepam can cause thrombophlebitis, which is characterized by inflammation with inflammatory edema and intramural polymorphonuclear-cell infiltration. This side effect is already mentioned in the first document 'Diazepam hypnosis for orthopaedic manipulations'. Since Tinel's sign, Virrel's sign, Batters sign, and Bell's sign are all related to orthopedic or neurological conditions, they are not directly related to the effects of IV diazepam.
