["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about delayed development in a 3-year-old child. The given milestones are all related to gross motor skills (A), fine motor skills (B), and daily living skills (C). Since there is no clear indication of any developmental delay, we need to look at the provided documents for relevant information. In the document 'Influence of illness on developmental progress in children under two', it states that illnesses experienced between 0 and 7 months have less influence upon seven-month developmental scores than upon 24-month developmental scores. This suggests that by age three, most children would have already achieved certain milestones.\n\nThe document 'A method of developmental assessment at four years and some associated findings' mentions a global score for assessing the developmental status of 4-year-old children. This implies that there is a standard set of milestones to be achieved by this age group.\n\nConsidering these documents, we can infer that absence of milestone C (Feeding by spoon) would not be considered delayed development at age three, as it is a normal part of daily living skills development.\n\nOn the other hand, milestones A and D are related to gross motor skills, which might be delayed if the child is having trouble achieving them. Milestone B is related to fine motor skills, but there is no specific information on when these skills should be achieved by age three.\n\nBased on this analysis, it seems that absence of milestone C would not be considered delayed development at age three.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
