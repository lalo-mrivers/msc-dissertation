However, one of the articles discusses chronic premature detachment of placenta, which might be related to Duncan placental separation. The article highlights that diagnosis was established by amniocentesis, single or serial ultrasound, and cardiotocography. It also mentions that newborns were premature, but all four survived.\n\nThe other articles do not specifically discuss Duncan placental separation. Therefore, the answer will rely on making an educated inference based on the provided information.\n\nBased on the provided information, one can infer that chronic premature detachment of placenta might be related to Duncan placental separation. However, the most common method of placental separation is not explicitly mentioned in the articles.\n\nThe maternal side of the placenta does present at the vulva during delivery, but this is a general statement about placentas in general and not specific to Duncan placental separation.\n\nSeparation starts from the periphery in some cases of chronic premature detachment of placenta, as mentioned in one of the articles. Blood can collect between the placenta and fetal membranes and escape through the vagina during delivery, but this is a general statement about placentas and not specifically related to Duncan placental separation.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer will be the most common method of placental separation.\", \"answer_choice\": B}"]
