["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, it is clear that propranolol is a beta-adrenoceptor blocking agent used to manage cardiovascular problems. However, its therapeutic uses are diverse and depend on the specific condition being treated. The document '[The hypotensive effect of propranolol: pathophysiological and clinical approach (author's transl)]' suggests that propranolol might be an effective treatment for hypertension in cases accompanied or caused by high plasma renin activity. On the other hand, 'Evaluation of propranolol in opiate dependence' reports that propranolol is not efficacious in treating opiate dependence and does not relieve or precipitate withdrawal symptoms. Additionally, 'Propranolol and morphine' reveals that propranolol does not alter the LD50 of morphine, suggesting it may not be a morphine antagonist. Given this information, it can be inferred that propranolol is not a drug of choice for treating infantile hemangioma or other vascular malformations.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"None of the above\""]
