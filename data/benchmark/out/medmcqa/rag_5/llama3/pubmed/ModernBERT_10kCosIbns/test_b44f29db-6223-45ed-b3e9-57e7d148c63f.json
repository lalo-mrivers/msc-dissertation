["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about devices that work on traction principle. Upon reviewing the provided documents, we can see that none of them discuss devices specifically related to traction principles. However, one document (Torques developed by different types of shoes on various playing surfaces) does mention torque and forces at the shoe-turf interface, which could be related to traction.
