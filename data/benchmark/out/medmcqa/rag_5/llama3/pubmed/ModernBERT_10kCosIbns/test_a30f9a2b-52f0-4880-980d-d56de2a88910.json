["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the properties of dopamine that are not helpful in acute shock. We need to look at the relevant documents to find answers. From [Use of dopamine in the treatment of cardiogenic shock] and [Hemodynamic study of dopamine], we know that dopamine has a direct action on the heart, increasing cardiac output and myocardial contractility, which is beneficial in shock states. From [The clinical use of dopamine], we see that dopamine directly dilates mesenteric, renal, and cerebral vessels, redirecting blood flow to essential viscera, which also helps in acute shock. The document [Hemodynamic and therapeutic effects of intravenous dopamine] shows that dopamine infusion increased cardiac output, decreased ventricular filling pressure, and increased urine output in patients with cardiogenic shock, further supporting its beneficial effects in shock states. Based on these findings, we can conclude that the property not helpful in acute shock is...\", \n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
