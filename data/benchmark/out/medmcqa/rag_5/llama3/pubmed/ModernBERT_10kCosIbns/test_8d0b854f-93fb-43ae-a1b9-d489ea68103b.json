["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 2-month-old girl with failure to thrive, polyuria, and medullary nephrocalcinosis affecting both kidneys. The laboratory tests show a blood pH of 7.48, bicarbonate level of 25 mEq/L, potassium level of 2 mEq/L, sodium level of 126 mEq/L, and chloride level of 88 mEq/L. Given the presence of nephrocalcinosis, we need to consider the underlying cause. The patient's blood pH is alkaline (7.48), which suggests that there may be an underlying disorder of acid-base homeostasis. Additionally, the low bicarbonate level and high potassium level are consistent with a diagnosis of renal tubular acidosis. Given these findings, we can conclude that the most likely diagnosis is distal renal tubular acidosis.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
