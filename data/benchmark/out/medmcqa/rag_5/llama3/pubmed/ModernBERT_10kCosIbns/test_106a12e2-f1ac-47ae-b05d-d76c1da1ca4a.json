["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Hyaline membrane disease (HMD) is characterized by the formation of hyaline membranes in the lungs. The relevant documents describe three types of bubbles that can be radiographically identified in HMD: type I represents overdistended terminal bronchioles and alveolar ducts, type II represents pulmonary interstitial emphysema, and type III represents focally distended alveolar groups in a scarred, immature lung. Since the question does not specifically mention bubbles or interstitial pressure, we must focus on the definition of hyaline membrane disease. The relevant documents describe HMD as characterized by the formation of hyaline membranes lining the terminal bronchioles and alveoli. This suggests that HMD is characterized by an inflammatory response in the lungs leading to the formation of these membranes.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
