["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The provided documents do not explicitly mention the 'Step back technique'. However, we can analyze the content to gather relevant information. The first document discusses general program parameters for a back injury prevention program. The second article talks about a back rehabilitation program specifically designed for ballet dancers. The third document investigates the effectiveness of the Geneva Back School and the role of prior knowledge on back-pain education. Finally, the fourth document provides general information for back school participants. None of these documents mention 'Step back technique'. Therefore, we can conclude that there is no relevant information available to answer this question. Based on this reasoning, I would choose option D as it suggests that there is no such thing as a 'Step back technique' or at least not mentioned in the provided documents.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
