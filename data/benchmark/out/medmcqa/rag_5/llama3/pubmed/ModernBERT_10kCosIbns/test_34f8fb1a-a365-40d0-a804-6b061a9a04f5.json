["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Analyzing the documents, we can see that canal preparation is a complex procedure, and one of its components is shaping. Shaping of the canal depends on the obturating material and the condensing instruments. Because gutta-percha is the preferred material, and lateral condensation the most common technique, preparations should be flared. Flaring (or step-back) is the most commonly taught and used approach. This method encourages a small apical preparation with larger instruments used at successively decreasing lengths to create a taper.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
