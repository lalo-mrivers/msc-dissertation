["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe various methods for estimating fetal maturity. The study on amniotic fluid tests for fetal maturity mentions that the coefficient of correlation between true gestational age and estimated period of gestation based on amniotic fluid creatinine, percentage of lipid-positive cells, and L/S ratio is 0.94 in normal pregnancy. The same study also shows that in diabetic pregnancies, the mean L/S ratio is depressed. Therefore, the L:S ratio may be a good indicator of fetal maturity in a diabetic mother.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
