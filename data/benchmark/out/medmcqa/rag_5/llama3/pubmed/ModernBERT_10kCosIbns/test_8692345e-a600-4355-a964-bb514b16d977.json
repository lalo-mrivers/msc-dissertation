["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The SCID mouse mutant has a severe deficiency in functional B and T lymphocytes due to impairment of antigen receptor gene recombination. The mutation also impairs DNA repair, making the mice more sensitive to radiation-induced chromosomal damage. This suggests that the SCID mutation is involved in both lymphocyte development and DNA repair pathways. Therefore, we can infer that genes related to these processes are likely to be affected by the SCID mutation.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
