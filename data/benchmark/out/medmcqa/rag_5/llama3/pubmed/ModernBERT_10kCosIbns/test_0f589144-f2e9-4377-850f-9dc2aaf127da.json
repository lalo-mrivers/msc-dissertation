["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the effect of one unit of PRBC (packed red blood cells) on HCT (hematocrit), which is likely a measure of red blood cell count. The relevant documents describe the prevalence of HCV antibodies among different groups, including patients with chronic non-A, non-B hepatitis and those who have received blood transfusions. One study found that 38.9% of patients with non-A, non-B hepatitis following blood transfusion had HCV antibodies. Another study mentioned that mostly HCV infection was connected with the blood transfusion. These findings suggest that blood transfusions may be a risk factor for HCV infection.\n\nThe question does not provide any specific information about the effect of one unit of PRBC on HCT, so we need to look for general trends or associations between blood transfusions and HCV infection.\n\nOne study found that patients who have received blood transfusions have a higher prevalence of HCV antibodies (38.9%) compared to other high-risk groups such as drug addicts (14.8%) or haemophiliacs (12.4%). This suggests that blood transfusions may be associated with a higher risk of HCV infection.\n\nAnother study mentioned that the course of acute phase of HCV infection was mild, short-lasting, and without or with sporadic extrahepatic symptoms; the activity of aminotransferases and the bilirubin level were of average value. This suggests that HCV infection may not have a significant impact on HCT.\n\nTherefore, based on these findings, it is likely that one unit of PRBC raises HCT by 2-5%.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
