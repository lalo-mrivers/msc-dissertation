["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The given ABG values indicate a pH of 7.40 which is normal, pCO2 of 40 mm Hg which is also within the normal range, and HCO3 of 25 mEq/L which suggests metabolic alkalosis. Given that there is no significant abnormality in the anion gap (Na - Chloride), we can rule out high anion gap metabolic acidosis or high anion gap metabolic alkalosis. Since the patient has presented with protracted vomiting, it's possible that the metabolic alkalosis might be related to a vomiting-induced loss of bicarbonate-rich fluids.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C: No acid base abnormality\""]
