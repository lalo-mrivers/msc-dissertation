["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Firstly, we need to identify the number of true positives (TP), false positives (FP), true negatives (TN) and false negatives (FN). The test positive column represents patients with meningitis. Since 273 patients had a positive test and were diseased, this is our TP (true positives). There are no FP cases because we only consider patients suspected of having meningitis. In the test negative column, we have 595 non-diseased patients who all have negative tests. This represents our TN (true negatives) cases.\n\nNext, we need to find out how many diseased patients had a negative test and vice versa. Since there are no false positive cases, this means that the number of diseased patients with negative tests must be the difference between total diseased patients and TP: 273 - 273 = 0. Therefore, there are no FN (false negatives) cases.\n\nNow we can calculate the sensitivity and specificity using the following formulas:\n\nSensitivity = TP / (TP + FN)\nSpecificity = TN / (TN + FP)\n\nIn this case, since there are no FN or FP cases, Sensitivity is simply 1 (or 100%) because all diseased patients were correctly detected by the test. Specificity is also 1 (or 100%) because all non-diseased patients were correctly identified as such.\n\nFinally, we can calculate the sensitivity and specificity percentages by multiplying these values by 100:\n\nSensitivity = 1 * 100% = 100%\nSpecificity = 1 * 100% = 100%\n\nBased on this calculation, our answer is B: Sensitivity 100% Specificity 100%\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
