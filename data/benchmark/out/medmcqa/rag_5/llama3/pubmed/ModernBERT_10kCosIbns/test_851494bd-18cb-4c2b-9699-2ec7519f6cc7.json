["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the conversion of a monomer to a polymer. The relevant document 'General aspects in polymer synthesis' explains that the monomer must have a functionality of two or higher and the polymerization process must be characterized by a negative free energy change. This process can occur through chain-growth polymerization or step-growth polymerization. There is no mention of density changes or volume shrinkage in this document, so we need to look at other relevant information.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
