["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking which instrument made of the same steel with a grain size of 55 will be more prone to fracture. From the first document, it is mentioned that there is a sharp drop in resistance to fatigue fracture when the grain size is increased from 75 to 150 micrometers. Since the grain size here is 55, which is smaller than the mentioned range, we can conclude that the instruments will have higher resistance to fatigue fracture. Now, let's look at the shapes of the instruments. The shape with the highest stress concentration and the most uneven distribution of stress will be more prone to fracture. Among the options, the triangular reamer has the highest stress concentration due to its sharp edges and corners. Therefore, it will be more prone to fracture.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
