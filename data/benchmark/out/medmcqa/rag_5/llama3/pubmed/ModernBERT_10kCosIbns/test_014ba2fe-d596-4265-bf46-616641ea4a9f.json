["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has a history of two kids born with thalassemia major. We are looking for a test that can diagnose the condition early on in pregnancy. The relevant document mentions the use of PCR (polymerase chain reaction) for prenatal diagnosis of genetic disease, specifically for alpha and beta thalassemias. Additionally, the document highlights the importance of DNA analysis in parallel with conventional gene mapping. Given these details, we should focus on tests that involve DNA analysis. Chorionic villus sampling (CVS) is mentioned as a method used to obtain samples for DNA analysis. Non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) is also an option, but it's not explicitly mentioned in the context of thalassemia diagnosis. Amniocentesis and cordocentesis are invasive procedures that may not be necessary given the availability of CVS.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
