["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents discuss medical practices, regulations, and concerns about antimicrobial agents. The question asks what the use of a certain method is. Since the provided options are related to prevention or reduction of certain types of infections or reactions, I will analyze the documents for any mention of preventive measures. None of the documents explicitly state the use of this method as preventive. However, one document discusses antimicrobial agents and their proper use. This suggests that the method might be related to the rational use of antimicrobial agents.

The relevant documents do not explicitly state the use as preventing blood mismatch or viral infections.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
