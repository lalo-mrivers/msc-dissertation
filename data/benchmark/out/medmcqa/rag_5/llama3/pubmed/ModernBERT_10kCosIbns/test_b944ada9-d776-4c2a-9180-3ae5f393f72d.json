["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, we can analyze the information about glomerular capillaries. We know that ultrafiltration is driven by glomerular plasma flow rate and that the process of ultrafiltration is highly dependent on this parameter (Transport of molecules across renal glomerular capillaries). Additionally, we have evidence that the oncotic pressure of the fluid leaving the capillaries is less than that of fluid entering it (Filtration dynamics in dogs: glomerular capillary pressure).\n\nWe also know that constriction of afferent aeriole decreases blood flow to the glomerulus and increases glomerular capillary pressure, which can lead to increased filtration (Transport of molecules across renal glomerular capillaries).\n\nOn the other hand, glucose concentration in the capillaries is not mentioned as being the same as that in glomerular filtrate. Therefore, this option cannot be confirmed or denied based on provided information.\n\nFinally, hematocrit of the fluid leaving the capillaries is not directly mentioned in any of the documents, so we cannot confirm or deny this statement based on the given information.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
