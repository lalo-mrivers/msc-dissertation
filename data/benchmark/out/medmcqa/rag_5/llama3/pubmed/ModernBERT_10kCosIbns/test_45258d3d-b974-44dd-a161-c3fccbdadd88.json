["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about characteristics of myelinated nerve fibers. We know from previous studies that the number and size of myelinated nerve fibers have been determined at standard levels in the nerves of normal rats. Additionally, we have information on the molecular organization of the myelin membrane, including the identification of surface galactose residues on the external surface of the myelin sheath. Furthermore, we can infer from the study on X-ray diffraction comparison of myelins that central and peripheral nerve myelins may be structurally different.\n\nConsidering these findings, we can conclude that impulse through myelinated fibers is faster than non-myelinated fibers due to saltatory conduction (C), membrane currents are generated at nodes of Ranvier (B) and local anesthesia is effective only when the nerve is not covered by myelin sheath (D). This leaves option A as the one that is not true for myelinated nerve fibers, i.e., impulse through myelinated fibers is slower than non-myelinated fibers.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
