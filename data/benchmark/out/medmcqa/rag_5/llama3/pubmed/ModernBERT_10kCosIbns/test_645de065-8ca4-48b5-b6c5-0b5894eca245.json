["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents discuss the fatty acid patterns of human milk and the importance of essential fatty acids (EFAs) for normal growth and development. From the analysis of the fatty acid content of breast milk samples, we can see that the fatty acid pattern varied from day to day only for C 18:1. There were no significant variations among morning, midday, and evening values for samples provided by eight mothers. Additionally, the documents highlight the importance of polyunsaturated very long-chain FA in human milk, which come from the hydrolysis of circulating lipoproteins and are more dependent on the maternal dietary habits. Furthermore, the study suggests that arachidonic acid (AA; 20:4n-6) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; 22:6n-3) are important for normal biochemical and functional development of the central nervous system (CNS). Considering these points, it is likely that DHA is an EFA present in breast milk required for normal growth of children.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
