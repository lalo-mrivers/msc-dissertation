["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the time required for pre-oxygenation before tracheal intubation. There are no relevant documents provided that discuss this specific topic. The closest related information is from the 'Cardiovascular and plasma catecholamine responses at tracheal extubation' document, which mentions measurements of heart rate, systolic arterial pressure, diastolic arterial pressure, and rate-pressure product before induction of anaesthesia, before tracheal intubation, at the end of surgery, and 1, 3, and 5 min after tracheal extubation. However, this does not provide information on pre-oxygenation timing.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: 1 min\"\n}"]
