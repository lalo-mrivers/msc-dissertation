["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, we are looking for information about noncompetitive antagonism. Since none of the given documents discuss this specific topic, we will have to rely on general knowledge and biochemical principles. Noncompetitive antagonists bind to an enzyme at a site other than the active site, which decreases enzyme activity without changing its substrate affinity. This means that vmax remains unchanged while Km increases.\n\nIn this case, the correct statement is: D: Km value increased; V max increased\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
