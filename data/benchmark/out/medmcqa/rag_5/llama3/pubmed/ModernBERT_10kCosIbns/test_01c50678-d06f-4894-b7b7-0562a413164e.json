["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents discuss various properties of composites, including pulp tolerance, marginal adaptation, abrasive behaviour and discolouration. One document specifically mentions the degradation of 15 composites under ethanol exposure, with fine-grained hybrid composites being least prone to degradation. Another document discusses subsurface deformation associated with hardness measurements, which could be relevant to polishing. Based on this information, it is likely that polishing of composite is problematic due to...\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B: Hard filler particles\"\n}"]
