["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe different surgical procedures for gingival recession, flaps, and extractions. There is no direct information about the outcome of a lateral sliding flap done on a tooth with roots denuded for 6 years. However, we can look at the studies that involve denuded roots or roots filled for some time. In 'Extraction of teeth with root preservation', there are results after a 2-month follow-up presented, but it does not specifically mention the outcome of a lateral sliding flap done on a tooth with roots denuded for 6 years. Similarly, in 'Treatment of localized gingival recessions', the study only looks at changes that occur on the recipient and donor teeth with regard to gingival recession, sulcus depth, and width of keratinized gingiva after performing a lateral sliding flap.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
