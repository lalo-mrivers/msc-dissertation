["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking which condition does not require SABE prophylaxis. We need to review the given documents to identify which conditions are associated with antibiotic prophylaxis and which ones are not. From the documents, we can see that antibiotic prophylaxis is discussed in various contexts such as high-risk obstetrics, bacterial endocarditis, intensive care patients, surgery, and myocardial infarction.\n\nIn the context of obstetrics, antibiotic prophylaxis is mentioned for unbooked patients who had cesarian section. In the case of bacterial endocarditis, antibiotics are given before medical and dental procedures to prevent endocarditis. For intensive care patients, antibiotic prophylaxis does not reduce infection rates or mortality but may delay septicaemia.\n\nIn surgery, a 4-year personal case series suggests that antibiotic prophylaxis is useful in high-risk patients. In the context of myocardial infarction, secondary prophylactic drugs are used to prevent further infarctions.\n\nBased on this review, we can see that antibiotic prophylaxis is not directly associated with MR (Mitral Regurgitation), ASD (Atrial Septal Defect), or MS (Mitral Stenosis). Therefore, these conditions do not require SABE prophylaxis. CABG (Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting) may be related to antibiotic prophylaxis in the context of surgery but it is not a standalone condition that requires SABE prophylaxis.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B: ASD\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
