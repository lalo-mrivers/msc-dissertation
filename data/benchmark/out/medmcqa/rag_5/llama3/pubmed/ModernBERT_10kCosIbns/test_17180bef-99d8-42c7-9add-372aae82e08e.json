["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents provided discuss the endothelial-cell control of local blood flow, the effects of vasoactive drugs on haemodynamic power and input impedance, afterload reduction and cardiac performance, and the influence of vasodilators on function and metabolism of ischemic myocardium. Vasodilation is a process that causes blood vessels to dilate and increase blood flow. From these documents, we can see that vasodilation is caused by various factors such as endothelial-derived relaxing factor (EDRF), which is similar to nitric oxide. Other vasodilating agents mentioned include nitrates, nitroprusside, phentolamine, prazosin, and hydralazine.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
