["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"After reviewing the documents, it becomes clear that mucostatic impressions are used to take into account the changes caused by prosthesis-induced alterations of the oral mucosa. The main aetiological factor for these changes is mechanical irritation produced by the prosthesis. In the case [Plastic bonding material as the origin of mucosal disorders], the patient experienced sensations in the mucosa over a period of one year, which disappeared when the plastic facing on the upper anterior crowns was removed.

In this case, I would recommend taking a mucostatic impression for an Upper RPD with Kennedy IV classification.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
