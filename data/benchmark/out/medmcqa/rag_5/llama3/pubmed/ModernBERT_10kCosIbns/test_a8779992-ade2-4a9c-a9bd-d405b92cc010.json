["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the percentage of collagen fibers and fibroblasts present in gingival connective tissue. We can start by looking at the relevant documents. The first document talks about the synthesis of collagens by fibroblasts from healthy and diseased human gingiva. It states that all cell lines synthesized predominantly type I collagen, with type III collagen being a minor product. This suggests that collagen fibers are likely to be the main component of the tissue.\n\nThe second document also discusses the synthesis of collagens by fibroblasts from healthy and diseased human gingiva. It mentions that cells from normal tissue synthesized type III collagen in amounts varying from 5 to 30%. However, it does not provide any information about the percentage of collagen fibers or fibroblasts.\n\nThe third document talks about the metabolism of collagen in a rat. It discusses the incorporation and disappearance of tritium activity from proline and hydroxyproline over time. This document is not directly relevant to the question, but it does suggest that there may be regional variation in the metabolism of collagen.\n\nBased on this information, we can conclude that the percentage of collagen fibers present in gingival connective tissue is likely to be around 60-65%, with type I collagen being the main component. The percentage of fibroblasts is less clear, but based on the fact that all cell lines synthesized predominantly type I collagen, it is likely to be around 5-10%.\n\nTherefore, our answer choice is D: 65% & 10%\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
