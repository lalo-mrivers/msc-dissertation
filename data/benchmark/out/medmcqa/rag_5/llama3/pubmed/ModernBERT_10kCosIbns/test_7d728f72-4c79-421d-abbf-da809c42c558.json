["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the deep part of perineal body causing cystocele, enterocele and urethral descent. The relevant documents are about skin symptoms of chronic inflammation of a tooth root apex, folliculitis granulomatosa perforans profunda, leiomyomatosis peritonealis disseminata, pericecal internal hernia of the retrocecal fossa, and pseudomyxoma peritonei of ovarian origin. After reviewing these documents, I did not find any information related to the perineal body or its deep parts. Therefore, I will look for relevant information from other sources. The key is to understand that cystocele, enterocele and urethral descent are related to pelvic floor dysfunction, specifically vaginal vault prolapse. This condition is caused by injury or weakening of the pelvic muscles, particularly the pubococcygeus muscle.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
