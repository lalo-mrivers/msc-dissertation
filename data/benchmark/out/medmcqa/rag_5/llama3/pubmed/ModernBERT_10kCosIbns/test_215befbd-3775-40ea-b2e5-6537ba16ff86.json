["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents provide information on the composition of high-density lipoproteins (HDL). According to the first document, HDL is synthesized both in the liver and intestine. The second document mentions that all apoproteins can be synthesized in the liver and intestine except for 'C' apoproteins which cannot be synthesized by the intestine. The fourth document describes the dynamic properties of human high-density lipoprotein apoproteins, stating that apoA-I, apoA-II, and C proteins exist in equilibrium between HDL2 and HDL3. This information suggests that HDL is rich in apoproteins compared to other lipoproteins.\", \"answer_choice\": B}"]
