["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the characteristics of heart muscle cells. The relevant documents mention that myosins of white skeletal, heart, and smooth muscle differ in their activity and structure. Heart muscle is described as being species specific. These findings suggest that heart muscle cells do not have multiple nuclei (choice B) since each cell has its own nucleus. It also does not act as a syncitium (choice A) because it is composed of individual cells with distinct membranes. The presence of gap junctions (choice C) is also supported by the documents, which mention correlations between cellular structures and biochemical processes. Finally, the branching structure is not mentioned in the documents, so choice D can be ruled out.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
