["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe different types of fetal heart rate decelerations. In the first document, it is mentioned that a high T/QRS ratio during cord compression correlates with higher catecholamine concentrations and shorter duration of elevated blood pressure. This suggests that umbilical cord compression can cause fetal distress. The second document describes reduced fetal movements associated with cord complications, which could be caused by gradual compression. The third document analyzes FHR tracings and finds correlations between certain patterns and neonatal depression. The fourth document presents a case where severe variable decelerations were caused by umbilical cord compression. The fifth document discusses accelerations in fetal heart rate during contractions, which can be followed by decelerations.\n\nBased on these descriptions, it is likely that the question refers to variable deceleration, as it is typically associated with umbilical cord compression and lasts less than 2 minutes.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
