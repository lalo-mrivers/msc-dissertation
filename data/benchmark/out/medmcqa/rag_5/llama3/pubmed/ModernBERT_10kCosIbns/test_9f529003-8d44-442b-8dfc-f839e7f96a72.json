["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about prevention of hemoptysis. The patient has already had massive hemoptysis. Therefore, we are looking for options that would prevent further bleeding. Pulmonary resection (such as lobectomy) is not a preventive measure but rather an intervention to control bleeding. Bronchoscopic laser cauterization and bronchial artery embolization can be used to control bleeding, but they are not primary preventive measures. Pulmonary artery embolization is not relevant to preventing hemoptysis.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
