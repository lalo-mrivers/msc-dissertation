["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the hormone that has the maximum effect on granulation wound healing. The documents provided describe the morphology and functional peculiarities of long non-healing wound granulation tissue cells. They also discuss the ultrastructure of the cellular elements of granulation tissue, including fibroblasts. According to these studies, the fibroblasts have endoplasmic reticulum with widened small canals, indicating high synthetic activity, which is crucial for collagen formation. Furthermore, it is mentioned that remodeling occurs and a mature scar evolves in the final stage of wound healing. Growth factors are also discussed as important regulators of the wound healing process. Therefore, I will focus on identifying the hormone that has the maximum effect on granulation wound healing based on this information.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
