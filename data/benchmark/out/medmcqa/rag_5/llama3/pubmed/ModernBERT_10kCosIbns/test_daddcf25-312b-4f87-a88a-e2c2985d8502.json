["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"After reviewing the provided documents, I did not find any information that directly addresses the detection of hydrocephalus ante-natally. Therefore, I will focus on general principles and common practices related to prenatal diagnosis. Hydrocephalus is typically diagnosed postnatally through clinical examination, imaging studies such as CT or MRI scans, and sometimes cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis. Since the question asks about antenatal detection, I will consider the current medical knowledge and guidelines on prenatal diagnosis of hydrocephalus-related conditions. Some conditions like aqueductal stenosis or Dandy-Walker malformation may be diagnosed ante-natally through ultrasound or amniocentesis.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
