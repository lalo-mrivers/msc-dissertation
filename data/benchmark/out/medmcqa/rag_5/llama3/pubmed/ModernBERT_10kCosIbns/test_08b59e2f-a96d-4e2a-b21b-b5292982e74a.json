["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The concept of reinforcement is central to behavior theory. In operant conditioning, 'reinforcement' refers to the process by which behavior is modified by its consequences. The present study examines one class of variables - establishing operations - that might influence the effectiveness of reinforcers. The results showed that each stimulus class functioned as a reinforcement with different degrees of effectiveness during satiation versus deprivation conditions. This suggests that negative reinforcement, in this context, would make the situation more desirable (less negative).\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C: Makes negative to more negative\"\n}"]
