["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"There are no documents that explicitly state the prevention of bleeding during maxillary osteotomy. However, we can analyze the provided information. The document 'Quantitation of blood flow after anterior maxillary osteotomy: investigation of three surgical approaches' mentions that the radioactive microsphere method was used to quantitate preoperative and postoperative blood flows in macaque monkeys when three different surgical approaches for anterior maxillary osteotomy were performed. Despite distinct variations in flap designs among the experimental groups, preoperative and postoperative determinations of blood flow were essentially unchanged. This suggests that the focus is on preserving the blood flow to tissues in the osteotomized segment rather than preventing bleeding.\n\nThe document 'A modified anterior maxillary ostectomy' does not provide information related to prevention of bleeding. The document 'Soft tissue response to anterior maxillary osteotomy' only discusses the soft tissue profile adaptation to anterior maxillary intrusion and does not mention anything about bleeding.\n\nThe document 'Complications associated with maxillary osteotomies' mentions that the paramount cause of complications in seven different cases seemed to be the interruption of the blood supply to the operative site. This suggests that preserving blood flow is crucial, but it does not provide information on preventing bleeding.\n\nBased on this analysis, we can conclude that the prevention of bleeding during maxillary osteotomy is not explicitly discussed in any of the provided documents.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
