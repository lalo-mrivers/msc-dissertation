["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The mandible's shape is influenced by the growth potentiality of the mandibular nerve. In humans, the brain's increasing size during hominization led to a decrease in the mandibular nerve's growth-in-length capability, resulting in shortening of the mandible and appearance of the chin. This suggests that depression of the mandible can be achieved by controlling the growth potentiality of the mandibular nerve.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: All of the above\"\n}"]
