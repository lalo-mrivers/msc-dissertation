["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, we can start by considering that the boy is asymptomatic and has a sho PR interval and delta wave on ECG. This suggests that he may have Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome (WPW). WPW is a condition where there are abnormal electrical pathways in the heart. The documents do not specifically mention WPW, but they do discuss normal EEG patterns in adolescents and arrhythmias in juvenile healthy volunteers. Given this information, we can conclude that the boy's ECG findings suggest an arrhythmic disorder. Therefore, the least effective measure for him would be a beta blocker, as it is typically used to treat tachyarrhythmias (fast heart rhythms) rather than WPW. Hotter monitoring could potentially help diagnose or monitor the arrhythmia, while a treadmill stress test might provide additional information about the boy's cardiac function.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
