["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about which drug is not used in management of rheumatoid arthritis. Let's review the documents. The first document talks about the principal drugs used in rheumatoid arthritis and their adverse reactions. It mentions antimalarials, immunosuppressive agents, gold salts, penicillamine, and levamisole as the five basic antirheumatic drugs. The second document reviews the drug spectrum in rheumatoid arthritis therapy, dividing it into nonsteroidal antirheumatic drugs, corticoids, combined drugs, and locally administered drugs.\n\nThe third document discusses the mode of action of antirheumatic drugs, mentioning cytostatics, D-penicillamine, gold salts, and chloroquine as the main drugs used for basic treatment. The fourth document reviews the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, including newer and experimental anti-inflammatory agents, and proposes a rational scheme for using these drugs.\n\nUpon reviewing these documents, we find that none of the mentioned drugs are not used in management of rheumatoid arthritis. However, let's examine the options provided: Etanercept, Leftunomide, Febuxostat, and Methotrexate.\n\nEtanercept is an anti-TNF-alpha agent commonly used in treating rheumatoid arthritis. Leftunomide is a DMARD (disease-modifying antirheumatic drug) also used to treat rheumatoid arthritis. Febuxostat is a xanthine oxidase inhibitor, often prescribed for gout and hyperuricemia.\n\nMethotrexate, on the other hand, is a DMARD commonly used in treating rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, and cancer.\n\nNone of these drugs are specifically mentioned as not being used in managing rheumatoid arthritis. Hence, we must look at the options again. Febuxostat is primarily used for gout and hyperuricemia, but it's also mentioned that some antirheumatic drugs can be used to treat gout. Therefore, it's possible that Febuxostat might not be commonly used in managing rheumatoid arthritis.\n\nThe documents don't explicitly state this, but considering the information provided, we can infer that Febuxostat is not primarily used for treating rheumatoid arthritis.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
