["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking what decreases GFR. We need to look at the relevant documents for information on factors that affect GFR. In the [A simple estimate of glomerular filtration rate in children derived from body length and plasma creatinine] document, we see a formula that relates GFR to plasma creatinine and body length. This suggests that changes in renal function can be detected by monitoring these parameters. In the [Chronic kidney insufficiency: results of treatment with growth hormone] document, we learn that GH therapy does not significantly change renal function. The [Assessing the progression of renal disease in clinical studies: effects of duration of follow-up and regression to the mean] document discusses the rate of decline in renal function over time, but does not mention factors that directly affect GFR.\n\nThe [An observation on growth hormone levels in patients with chronic renal failure] document mentions that some patients exhibit a 'paradoxical rise' of GH following an oral glucose load. There is no information here about GFR. The [Growth factors in the pathogenesis of renovascular complications of diabetes mellitus] document discusses various growth factors, but does not specifically mention their effects on GFR.\n\nThe relevant documents do not provide information on efferent aeriole constriction's effect on GFR. Renal stone in ureter and decreased oncotic pressure are not related to GFR. Therefore, the correct answer is B: Efferent aeriole constriction.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
