["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the principal fibers of the PDL (Periodontal Ligament). Based on the provided documents, none of them specifically mention the type of fibers found in the PDL. However, we can analyze the contents and see if any information can be inferred. The document about size changes in single muscle fibers during fixation and embedding does not provide any relevant information. The other documents deal with topics such as inertial behavior of fibers, lattice equilibria in striated muscle, and determination of relative fiber orientation in heart muscle. None of these topics seem to be related to the PDL or its principal fibers. Therefore, we cannot make an informed conclusion about the type of fibers found in the PDL based on the provided documents. We need more information or a different set of documents.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
