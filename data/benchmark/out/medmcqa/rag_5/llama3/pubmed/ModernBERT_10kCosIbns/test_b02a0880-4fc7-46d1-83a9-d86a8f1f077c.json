["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"We are looking for the source of estrogen and progesterone production during the first 2 months of pregnancy. In 'Hormonal patterns in conceptual cycles and early pregnancy', it is mentioned that there were increased levels in plasma and urine of all the hormones measured between 12 to 48 days after ovulation except progesterone, which decreased during this time. This suggests that the corpus luteum is responsible for producing these hormones. In 'Secretion patterns of plasma-progesterone, 17-hydroxyprogesterone, and 20alpha hydroxypregn-4-en-3-one in early normal pregnancy', it is mentioned that progesterone levels remained constant at about 24 ng/ml until week 10 and then rose progressively. This also suggests that the corpus luteum is responsible for producing progesterone during this period.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
