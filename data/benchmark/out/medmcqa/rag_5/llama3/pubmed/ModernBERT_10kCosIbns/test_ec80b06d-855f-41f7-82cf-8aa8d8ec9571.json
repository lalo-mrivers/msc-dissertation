["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about Group 2 sensory fibres. According to the documents, T1 units have rapidly adapting receptors that are sensitive to skin traction over a distance of more than 10 cm. T2 units also have rapidly adapting receptors with high threshold. Neither of these descriptions matches any of the given options. However, T3 and T4 units have slowly adapting receptors, with the lowest threshold among T afferents for light touch with no movement (T3) or a movement component parallel to the skin surface (T4). Since Group 2 fibres are associated with T1-T4 units, we can infer that Group 2 sensory fibres are attached to either T3 or T4 receptors.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
