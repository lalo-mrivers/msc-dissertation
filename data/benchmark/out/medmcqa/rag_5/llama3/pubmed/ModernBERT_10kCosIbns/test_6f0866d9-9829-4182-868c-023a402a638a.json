["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the outermost covering of nerve fibers. From the given documents, we can see that in one document (Electron microscopic investigations on the growing tip of nerve fibres in the developing distal forelimb of the mouse.), it is mentioned that 'Small nerves fibres are to be found in the space between the layer of the cutaneous blood vessels and the epidermis.' This suggests that there may not be any direct information about the outermost covering of nerve fibers. In another document (Morphometry of living and metal salt impregnated nerve fibers.), it is mentioned that 'The diameters of neuronal fibres, axial cylinders and cords have been measured through the microscope with an ocular micrometer.' This suggests that there may not be any direct information about the outermost covering of nerve fibers either. In another document (Connective tissues in the optic nerve and in peripheral nerves: ultrastructural observations.), it is mentioned that 'The outermost of three concentric sheaths enveloping the nerve appear very similar;...' This suggests that there may not be any direct information about the outermost covering of nerve fibers either. Finally, we can see that in one document (Ultrastructural localization of the major components of the extracellular matrix in normal rat nerve.), it is mentioned that 'The localization of these macromolecules was investigated in basement membranes as well as in different areas of epi-, peri-, and endoneurium...'. This suggests that there may not be any direct information about the outermost covering of nerve fibers either. Therefore, we can conclude that the question does not have a direct answer from the given documents.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
