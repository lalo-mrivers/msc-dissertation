["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The provided documents describe the effects of papain on immunoglobulins (Ig) of different classes. From these studies, we can infer that papain cleaves IgM and IgD on murine splenocytes more readily than other isotypes. Furthermore, it has been shown that papain hydrolyzes IgG into Fab and Fc fragments. Therefore, considering the given options, it is most likely that hydrolysis of IgG with papain will lead to formation of:\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A: 1 Fc and 2 Fab fragments\"\n}"]
