["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about a comparison between high copper silver alloy and conventional alloy. The provided documents discuss properties of amalgam alloys, including their strength, hardness, and tarnish resistance. From the information in 'A study of high copper amalgams' and 'The strength of fifteen amalgam alloys', we can conclude that high copper silver alloy generally has greater tensile and compressive strength compared to conventional alloy. This is stated in 'The strength of fifteen amalgam alloys' as 'Alloys of the single melt high copper type generally possess the greatest strength at all times of testing.'\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
