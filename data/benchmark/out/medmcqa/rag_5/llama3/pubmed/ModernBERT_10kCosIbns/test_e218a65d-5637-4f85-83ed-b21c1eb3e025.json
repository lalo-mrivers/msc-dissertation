["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The document [Mercury release from amalgam specimens] suggests that mercury vapour is released from amalgams. The study found that KSCN-containing solution inhibits corrosion and reduces the release of mercury. This implies that an increase in residual mercury in silver amalgam filling may lead to increased corrosion, which could be detrimental to the filling. The document [The release of mercury and copper from in vivo aged amalgam fillings] also supports this idea by showing that polishing amalgams can reduce the release of mercury and copper, indicating that an increase in residual mercury may lead to increased corrosion.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
