["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The passage highlights the importance of preventing HIV transmission from mother to child. It is established that perinatal transmission occurs at a rate between 15-25% in Europe and North America. The optimal methods for early diagnosis of HIV infection in infants include viral cultures and gene amplification of HIV DNA by polymerase chain reaction within the first 6 months of life. Furthermore, it is known that children with negative tests at 15 months are indeed uninfected. However, knowledge gaps exist regarding the exact timing of transmission (in utero, during delivery or post-partum), the relative frequency of transmission during each period, and the mechanism(s) involved (particularly the role of the placenta). Given these facts, it is crucial to develop preventive therapy and reliable antenatal diagnostic tests to inform HIV-seropositive women of the relative risks.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
