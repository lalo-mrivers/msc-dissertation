["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the provided documents, we can see that vitamins are either prepared chemically or biotechnologically via fermentation or bioconversion processes. Since the question asks about which vitamin is synthesized in vivo by humans, we need to look for information on vitamins that are produced within the body. According to the document 'Vitamin metabolism and requirements: some aspects reviewed', the requirements of these nutrients appear to be the result of their excretory losses in the urine and faeces and through metabolic degradations. This suggests that the human body has a mechanism for synthesizing certain vitamins, which are then excreted or degraded.\n\nUpon reviewing the options provided, we see that niacin (B3) is produced from tryptophan in humans, pantothenic acid (B5) is synthesized in the liver and kidneys, and folic acid (B9) is synthesized in the gut. Cyanocobalamin (B12) is produced in the gut by bacteria.\n\nBased on this information, it appears that some of these vitamins are synthesized in vivo by humans, specifically niacin, pantothenic acid, and folic acid.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A or B or D\""]
