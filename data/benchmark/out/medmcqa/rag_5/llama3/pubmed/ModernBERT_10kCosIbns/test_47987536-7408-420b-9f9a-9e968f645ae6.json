["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to the relevant documents, brain death occurs when there is involvement of higher centers such as Cerebral Cortex and Thalamus (unresponsiveness and deep coma) and Brainstem and Basal ganglionic structures (loss of spontaneous respiration all cranial nerve, and postural reflexes). Involvement of Spinal Cord is less constant. Considering this definition, the signs mentioned in the question are: Normal BP without pharmacological support (which seems to be a normal sign), Positive spinal reflexes on stimulation (which contradicts the involvement of brainstem and basal ganglionic structures), Sweating and tachycardia (which may occur in response to stress or other factors, but is not necessarily related to brain death), Decoicate and decerebrate posturing (which is actually a sign of brainstem function). Therefore, the correct answer is B: Positive spinal reflexes on stimulation.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
