["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for a continuous murmur that cannot be heard in all cases. The documents provided describe different types of murmurs, but the key point is that innocent murmurs are typically found at the aortic valve. According to the study on aortic origin of innocent murmurs, the intensity of intraarterial sound was greater above the aortic than above the pulmonary valve. This suggests that murmurs associated with the aortic valve would be more likely to produce a continuous murmur. Additionally, the study on musical murmurs found that regular valve leaflet flutter at a frequency identical to that of the simultaneously recorded musical murmur is often seen in patients with aortic regurgitation.\n\nBased on this information, it can be inferred that murmurs associated with the pulmonary valve or patent ductus arteriosus would not typically produce a continuous murmur. Therefore, option C: Pulmonary AV fistula is the most likely correct answer.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
