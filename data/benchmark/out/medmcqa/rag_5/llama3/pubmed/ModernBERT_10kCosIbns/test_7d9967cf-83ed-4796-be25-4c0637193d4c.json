["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"After reviewing the provided documents, I noticed that there is no direct mention of absolute refractoriness or its mechanisms. However, one of the key findings in the 'Response waveforms of vertebrate photoreceptors' document is the coupling dynamics between the inner and outer segments of the photoreceptor cell. This could be related to the refractoriness phenomenon, but it's not a direct answer. I'll need to consider other possibilities.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
