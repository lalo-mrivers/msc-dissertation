["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The provided documents discuss bilirubin conjugates and their significance in the formation of pigment gallstones. The composition of bilirubin conjugates in bile was similar between cholesterol and black pigment stones. However, unconjugated bilirubin was higher in brown pigment stone cases than in cholesterol stone cases. Additionally, glucoside and xyloside conjugates are also major components, regardless of the types of gallstones present. Since urobilinogen is a breakdown product of bilirubin, it's likely that unconjugated bilirubin levels will be higher in obstructed jaundice due to brown pigment stone cases.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
