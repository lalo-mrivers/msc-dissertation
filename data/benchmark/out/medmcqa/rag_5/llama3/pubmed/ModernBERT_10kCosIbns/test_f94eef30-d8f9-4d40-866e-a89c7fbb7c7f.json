["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for a drug that does not require dose adjustment in renal disease. We need to look at the documents provided which discuss drug dosing guidelines in patients with renal failure and principles of drug therapy in patients with renal disease. From these documents, we can infer that most drugs are fully or partially excreted by the kidney; therefore, drug dosage regimens often need to be adjusted in order to provide safe yet effective treatment for patients with renal disease. However, there is one class of drugs mentioned as not being dependent on the kidneys for elimination: 'many drugs that are not dependent on the kidneys for elimination may exert untoward effects in the uremic milieu of advanced renal disease.' This suggests that some drugs may not require dose adjustment in renal disease because they do not rely on kidney function for excretion. From the options provided, calcium channel blockers are a class of drugs that do not depend on the kidneys for elimination.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
