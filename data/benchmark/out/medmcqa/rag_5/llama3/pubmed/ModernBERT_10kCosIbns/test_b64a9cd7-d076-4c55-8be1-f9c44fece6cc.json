["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about a 29-year-old woman with a previous child having Down syndrome. The key point here is that she does not want another child with Down syndrome. Given her age and the fact that she already has a child with Down syndrome, we need to consider the risk of trisomy 21 (Down syndrome) in her next pregnancy. According to the literature, the risk of having a child with Down syndrome increases with maternal age. Although her age is below 35 years, the risk is still significant. Therefore, it would be reasonable to suggest some form of prenatal testing to determine if the fetus has trisomy 21 or not.\n\nConsidering the available documents, we can see that the literature does discuss the association between Down syndrome and congenital heart disease, as well as other health problems. However, there is no direct mention of prenatal testing for Down syndrome in these documents. Nevertheless, based on general knowledge about prenatal testing and maternal age, it would be appropriate to suggest some form of testing.\n\nA quick review of the options shows that option C is the most relevant one. It suggests using amniotic fluid samples plus chromosomal analysis to determine if the next baby will have Down syndrome or not.\", \"answer_choice\": C}"]
