The article '[A complete denture rebasing method in two appointments]' specifically discusses the process of rebasing a complete denture.

The purpose of this article was to introduce an effective method for rebasing complete dentures, which involves using the interridge distance, the distance between the upper edentulous ridge and the occlusal surface of the lower acrylic teeth, and interocclusal records obtained immediately after each impression to correct the displacement of the denture base accurately. Therefore, a change is effected in the entire denture base.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
