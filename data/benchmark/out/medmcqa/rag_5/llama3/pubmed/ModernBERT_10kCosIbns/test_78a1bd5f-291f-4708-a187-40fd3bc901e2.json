["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for a type of skin carcinoma that spreads by local invasion and has no tendency to metastasize. From the provided documents, it can be seen that primary mucinous carcinoma of the skin shows rapid progression and recurrence with lymph node metastases, which does not match the description in the question. Squamous cell carcinoma of the skin is also mentioned as a type of skin cancer, but there is no indication that it does not metastasize. Basal cell carcinoma is commonly known to be a non-metastatic skin cancer that spreads by local invasion, so this option seems more likely.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B\n}"]
