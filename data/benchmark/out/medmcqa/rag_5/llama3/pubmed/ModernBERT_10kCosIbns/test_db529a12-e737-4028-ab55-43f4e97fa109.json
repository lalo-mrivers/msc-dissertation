["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks to identify the agent least likely to cause lactose intolerance. According to the provided documents, milk A contains no lactose, while milk B has 12.5 g and milk C contains 37.5 g of lactose. The study shows that the frequency with which symptoms occur in persons with lactose malabsorption increases in direct relation to the lactose content of the milk.\n\nCondensed milk is not mentioned as a specific type of milk in the provided documents, but it can be assumed to contain some amount of lactose since it is made from milk. Skimmed milk and ice cream are both types of milk products that would likely contain lactose. Yogurt is a fermented dairy product that contains some lactose, although the amount may vary depending on the type of yogurt.\n\nBased on this information, I would conclude that condensed milk is least likely to cause lactose intolerance.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
