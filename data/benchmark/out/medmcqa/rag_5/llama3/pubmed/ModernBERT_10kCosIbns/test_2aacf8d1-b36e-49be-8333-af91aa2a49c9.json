["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the optic disc in glaucoma and optic atrophy. In the article 'The optic disc in glaucoma, III: diffuse optic disc pallor with raised intraocular pressure', it is mentioned that patients with chronic simple glaucoma may have features atypical for this disease and more suggestive of an acute ischaemic optic neuropathy. This suggests that there may be different mechanisms involved in the development of visual loss in glaucoma.\n\nIn the article 'A clinicopathologic study of autosomal dominant optic atrophy', it is mentioned that the affected members showed similar centrocecal scotomata, and most affected patients had severe unclassified color defects. This suggests that the cells affected are likely to be ganglion cells.\n\nThe article 'Visual field defects, cup-disc ratio and fluorescein angiography in glaucomatous optic atrophy' mentions that a marked decrease in the capillaries was seen in accordance with the increase in the cup-disc ratio, suggesting that the capillaries may be affected. However, this does not specifically identify the cells affected.\n\nThe article 'The histology of human glaucoma cupping and optic nerve damage: clinicopathologic correlation in 21 eyes' suggests that acquired increases in optic disc cup size prior to detectable visual field loss probably represent loss of ganglion cell axonal fibers which is not yet significant enough to produce field defects. This further supports the idea that ganglion cells are affected.\n\nThe article 'An aetiological profile of optic atrophy' does not specifically address the cells affected in glaucomatous optic neuropathy.\n\nBased on these findings, it appears that the cells most likely to be affected in glaucomatous optic neuropathy are ganglion cells.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
