["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the relation between the variance of diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and vitamin D, we need to compare their standard deviations (SD). The mean DBP is 110 mm Hg with an SD of 11 mm Hg, while the mean vitamin D level is 18 ng/ml with an SD of 3 ng/ml. First, we can square the SDs to obtain the variances: variance of DBP = 121 mm Hg^2 and variance of vitamin D = 9 ng/ml^2. Next, we compare these variances by dividing the larger one by the smaller one. In this case, the variance of DBP (121) is greater than four times the variance of vitamin D (9), which means that the variance of DBP is significantly higher than the variance of vitamin D.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
