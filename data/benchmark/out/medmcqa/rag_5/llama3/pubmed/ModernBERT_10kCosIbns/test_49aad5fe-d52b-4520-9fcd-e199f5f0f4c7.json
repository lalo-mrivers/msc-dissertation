["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents provide information on the effects of vibration on human subjects. The first document discusses the potential applications of vibratory stimulation in treating motor dysfunctions, but does not mention the negative effects of continued use of a vibrator. The second document describes an experiment where vibratory stimulation was used to train subjects to isolate a motor unit, and notes that marked spatial recruitment of motor units occurred during and after vibration. This suggests that long-term exposure to vibration may lead to muscle reeducation or other changes in motor function. However, there is no direct evidence in these documents that continued use of a vibrator can lead to random nodule formation, surface roughness, surface irregularities, or discoloration.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
