["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The SEM investigation on pulpal-periodontal connections in primary teeth reveals that accessory channels are found on the pulpal floor in 21 out of 30 examined teeth. This suggests that the pulpal floor is prone to exposure, especially if it's made perpendicular to the long axis of tooth.

This makes it susceptible to pulpal exposure if the pulpal floor is not properly sealed.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
