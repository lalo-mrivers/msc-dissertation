["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, we can see that transfusion-associated malaria is caused by the presence of parasites in the blood. Since the incubation period is shorter for transfusion-associated malaria compared to malaria acquired through mosquito bites, it suggests that the parasites are already present in the blood.
