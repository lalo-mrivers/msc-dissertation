["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, it is clear that radiation exposure has biological effects that can result in damage to DNA, cell death, loss of reproductive integrity, mutation, cancer, developmental anomalies and other radiobiological effects. The dose, dose rate, radiation quality, biological and chemical modifiers also have a pronounced effect upon the extent of radiation responses.\n\nIt is mentioned in 'Radiations and public health (author's transl)' that medical irradiation should modify the incidence of certain affections but quite insignificantly as compared with the regional or local variations observed. This suggests that the effects of radiation exposure are not uniform across all tissues.\n\nIn 'Radiobiological fundamentals in radioepidemiology and radiation protection', it is stated that damage to DNA is the principal, but not exclusive target for cell death, loss of reproductive integrity, mutation, cancer, developmental anomalies and other radiobiological effects. This highlights the importance of DNA repair in affecting the survival of cells.\n\nConsidering these points, we can infer that tissues with less complex or sensitive cellular structures would be less affected by radiation exposure.\n\nAmong the options provided, nerve tissue is least likely to be sensitive to radiation exposure as it has a relatively simple cellular structure and its function is not dependent on rapid cell division or DNA repair. In contrast, bone, hematopoietic tissue, and muscle all require complex cellular processes for their function and would be more susceptible to the effects of radiation exposure.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
