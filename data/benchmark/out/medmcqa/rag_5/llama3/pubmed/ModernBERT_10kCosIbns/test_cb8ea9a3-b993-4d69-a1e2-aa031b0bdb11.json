["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the given documents, specifically 'Application of \"cusp writer\" findings to practical and theoretical occlusal problems. Part II', we can see that the steepness of the curve of Spee determines the relative cusp height and angulation of one tooth to another, from an anterior to a posterior direction in the dental arch. This means that as we move from anterior to posterior teeth, the curve of Spee gets steeper. Therefore, the steepest cusp is likely to be found in the posterior teeth.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
