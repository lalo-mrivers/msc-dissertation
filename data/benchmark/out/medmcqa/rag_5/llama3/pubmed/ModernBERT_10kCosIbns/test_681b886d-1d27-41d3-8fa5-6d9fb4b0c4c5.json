["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about Stenopic slit's use. Stenopic slit refers to a type of slit-lamp microscopy that provides stereoscopic views. From the provided documents, it can be seen that Stenopic slit is used for guiding the laser beam in fundus surgery, teaching slit-lamp examination techniques, and allowing an observer to function as an assistant in surgery at the slit lamp. Therefore, it is not used for Fincham's test, determining the axis of cylinder, corneal tattooing, or iridectomy. The correct answer is a procedure that does not involve slit-lamp microscopy.\", \"answer_choice\": B}"]
