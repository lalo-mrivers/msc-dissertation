["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Firstly, we need to calculate the total number of births (live births + stillbirths). Then, we can calculate the neonatal mortality rate by dividing the number of neonatal deaths by the total number of births and multiplying by 1,000. Finally, we round the result to the nearest whole number.\n\nThe total number of births is: 12,450 (live births) + 212 (stillbirths) = 12,662\n\nNow, we can calculate the neonatal mortality rate:\n\nNeonatal mortality rate = (Number of neonatal deaths / Total number of births) * 1,000\n= (450 / 12,662) * 1,000\nâ‰ˆ 35.5\n\nRounded to the nearest whole number, the neonatal mortality rate is: 36\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
