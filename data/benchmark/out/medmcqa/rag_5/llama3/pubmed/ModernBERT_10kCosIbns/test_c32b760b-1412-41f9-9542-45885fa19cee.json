["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the incidence of extra canals in mandibular 1st molars. We are looking at a study on furcation anatomy of the first mandibular molar in dogs. Tooth surface and interradicular area measurements were taken of 20 first mandibular molar teeth obtained randomly from canine cadavers. The lingual furcation entrance had a mean width of 1.2 +/- 0.3 mm. There was no significant difference between mean furcation entrance measurements. But this study is not directly related to the question, it's about furcation anatomy in dogs. We need to look for another study that deals with root canal configuration of mandibular first premolars. One hundred six human mandibular left and right first premolars, previously extracted due to nonrestorable caries, periodontal disease, or orthodontic reasons, were sectioned perpendicular to the long axis of the root starting at the cementoenamel junction. Three-millimeter sections were made with an ultrathin separating disc to the level of the anatomical apex. After 1 day in 5.25% NaOCl, each section was rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline, evaluated with a stereomicroscope, and photographed. The slides were projected and the shape of the canal, incidence of multiple canals, level of bifurcation, and any other variant anatomy were recorded. Seventy-six percent of the premolars demonstrated Type I canals and 24% contained Type IV. The shape of the canals was predominantly oval or round. An interesting finding was the number of C-shaped canals which were associated predominantly with Type IV canal systems. This occurred in 14% of the roots.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: 40%\"\n}"]
