["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the active management of third stage of labour for the prevention of postpartum hemorrhage (PPH). The relevant documents discuss various methods to prevent or treat postpartum hemorrhage, including uterine massage, manual compression, blood and fluid replacement, medical therapy with a uterotonic agent, and surgical therapy. However, none of these methods are directly related to the third stage of labour, which is the period between delivery of the baby and expulsion of the placenta.\n\nThe key phrase here is 'active management of third stage of labour'.
