["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the development of afferents to the fetal rat cerebellum. At embryonic day (E) 12, central processes of vestibular ganglion cells were found to be the first identifiable afferents to the cerebellum. From E15, ipsilateral spinocerebellar fibres may be labelled, while contralateral inferior olivary nuclei could not be retrogradely labelled until E17. Trigeminocerebellar neurons in the interpolaris subnucleus of the nucleus of the trigeminal spinal tract and neurons of the lateral reticular nucleus were not labelled until E22 and P0, respectively. Finally, contralateral pontine nuclei were retrogradely labelled from the cerebellum after birth. These findings suggest that the development of afferents to the cerebellum is a complex process that occurs over several days.\n\nIn terms of efferent tracts, the documents describe the cerebellar cortex and its connections to the deep cerebellar nuclei. The parallel fiber, by virtue of its connection through Purkinje cells to the deep nuclei, appears optimally designed to combine the actions at several joints and to link the modes of adjacent nuclei into more complex coordinated acts.\n\nThe study on the change in feedback inhibition of monosynaptic spinal cord reflexes following removal of the anterior lobe of the cerebellum in cats suggests that the background control from the anterior lobe of the level of recurrent inhibition is one of the possible mechanisms participating in the cerebellar control of spinal motoneurons.\n\nThe review on messenger molecules in the cerebellum discusses the classic neurotransmitters and novel neuromodulators, together with second messenger-activated trophic factors, which can interact in complex ways. The study on cerebellar influence on parasympathetic neurones innervating intra-ocular muscles found that electrical stimulation of the cerebellar nuclei evoked a discharge in the short ciliary nerves.\n\nGiven these findings, it is possible to infer that efferent tracts from cerebellum arise from the deep cerebellar nuclei. The study on the development of afferents to the fetal rat cerebellum suggests that the central processes of vestibular ganglion cells were the first identifiable afferents to the cerebellum, and that these afferents arise from the vestibular system. The study on cerebellar influence on parasympathetic neurones innervating intra-ocular muscles found that electrical stimulation of the cerebellar nuclei evoked a discharge in the short ciliary nerves.\n\nThe studies suggest that the efferent tracts from cerebellum may arise from the deep cerebellar nuclei and not from the Purkinje cells or the cerebellar cortex. This is supported by the findings on the development of afferents to the fetal rat cerebellum, which suggest that the central processes of vestibular ganglion cells were the first identifiable afferents to the cerebellum.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
