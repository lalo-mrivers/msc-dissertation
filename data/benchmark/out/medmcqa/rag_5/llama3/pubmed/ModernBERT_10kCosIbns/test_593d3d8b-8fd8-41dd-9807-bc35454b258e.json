["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the most recent oral direct thrombin inhibitor (DTI) for acute stroke prevention. According to the provided documents, DTIs are a type of medication that block either the thrombin catalytic site or an anion-binding exosite which is a recognition site for some of its substrates. The document 'Thrombin antagonists and antiplatelet agents' mentions specific thrombin antagonists and antiplatelet agents that have shown superiority over heparin and aspirin in experimental models. The document 'Direct thrombin inhibitors' also discusses the development of synthetic or recombinant direct thrombin inhibitors, which block either the thrombin catalytic site or an anion-binding exosite. From these documents, it can be inferred that DTIs are a type of medication that is designed to inhibit the action of thrombin, which is activated during coagulation processes and stimulates fibrin formation and platelet aggregation.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C: Dabigatran\"\n}"]
