["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for the lower limit of the average IOP that can be expected 95% of times. We are given an average IOP of 30 mm and a standard deviation (SD) of 1.0. To find the answer, we need to use the Z-score method or a z-table. Since we are looking for the lower limit, we want to find the value where only 5% of cases fall below that point. Using the Z-score formula, we can calculate the Z-score corresponding to this percentage (95%). The Z-score is then used to find the corresponding IOP value using the Z-table or calculator.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
