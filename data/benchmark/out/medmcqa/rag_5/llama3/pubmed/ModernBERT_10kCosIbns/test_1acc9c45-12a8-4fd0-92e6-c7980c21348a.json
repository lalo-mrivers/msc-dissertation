["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking which parameter is used to determine the sensitivity of vaccine due to heat. From the provided documents, it can be seen that thermal sterilization and thermostability of vaccines are discussed. The document '[Principles for optimizing and guaging several processes in the technology of vaccine production. II. Modeling processes of thermal inactivation of microorganisms]' mentions the use of characteristics of thermal resistance of microorganisms as a theoretical foundation for guaranteed sterility. The document 'Stability of cholera and typhoid vaccines' discusses the thermosensitivity of different types of vaccines. Therefore, we can conclude that the sensitivity of vaccine due to heat is determined by its thermal resistance or thermostability.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
