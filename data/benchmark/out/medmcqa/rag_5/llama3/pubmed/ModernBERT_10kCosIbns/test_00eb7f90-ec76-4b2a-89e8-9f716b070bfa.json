["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the most common site for basal cell carcinoma occurrence. The documents mention BCCs on various anatomic sites. In 'Recurrence rates of treated basal cell carcinomas. Part 3: Surgical excision', it is mentioned that 588 previously untreated BCCs removed by surgical excision and the cumulative 5-year recurrence rate was 4.8%. It also states that the 5-year recurrence rate for BCCs excised from various anatomic sites were as follows: 1) neck, trunk, and extremities = 0.7%; 2) head--less than 6 mm in diameter = 3.2%; 3) head--6 to 9 mm in diameter = 8.0% (treated since 1964 = 5.2%); and 4) head--10 mm or more in diameter = 9.0%. This suggests that the majority of BCCs occur on the head.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
