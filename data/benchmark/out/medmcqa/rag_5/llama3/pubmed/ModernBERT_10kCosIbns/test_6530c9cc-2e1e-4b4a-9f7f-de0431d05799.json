["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the type of cell junction that allows exchange of cytoplasmic molecules between two cells. From the given documents, we can see that permeability of mammalian cell-to-cell membrane channels in juncton is limited by probe size and electronegativity. This suggests that there are specific types of channels or gaps that allow for the passage of certain molecules. In the document 'Cytoplasmic bridges and gap junctions in an insect cell line (Aedes albopictus)', we see that cytoplasmic bridges and gap junctions are mentioned as allowing intercellular diffusion of certain molecules but not others, suggesting a selective permeability.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
