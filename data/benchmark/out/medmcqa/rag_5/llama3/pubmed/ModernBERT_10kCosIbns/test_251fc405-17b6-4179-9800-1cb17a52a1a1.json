["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about Bacteroids. To find the correct answer, I will review the provided documents. There is no information about Bacteroids being susceptible to many antibiotics or present mainly in mixed infections. However, document 'Fermentation of mucin and plant polysaccharides by strains of Bacteroides from the human colon' mentions that some strains were able to ferment a variety of plant polysaccharides, but there is no specific information about the most common species. Document 'Deoxyribonucleic acid base composition of certain species of the genus Bacteroides' provides DNA base composition data for different Bacteroides species, including B. fragilis. However, this does not answer the question about the most common species.\n\nDocument 'Fermentation of glucose-1-phosphate: a screening test for fermentative Bacteroides species' mentions that 535 out of 544 strains of anaerobic bacteria tested were fermentative strains of Bacteroides, but it does not provide information about the most common species. Document 'Quantitative gas chromatography of Bacteroides species under different growth conditions' provides data on fermentation products and metabolic activities of different Bacteroides species, including B. fragilis.\n\nBased on these documents, I can conclude that there is no specific information about Bacteroids being susceptible to many antibiotics or present mainly in mixed infections. The most common species may be B. fragilis, but this is not explicitly stated. Therefore, the correct answer should exclude options A and B, as well as option C if it is the only one left.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
