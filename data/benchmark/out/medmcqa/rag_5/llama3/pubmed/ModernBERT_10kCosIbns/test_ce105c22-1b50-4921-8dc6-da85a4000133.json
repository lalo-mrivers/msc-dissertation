["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the use of hypertonic salt solutions. Hypertonic refers to a solution that has a higher concentration of salts than the surrounding environment.

There is no direct information on the specific situations where hypertonic salt solutions are used. However, we can infer from the studies that NaCl is often used to separate cell debris, proteins, and nucleic acids, which may indicate its use in medical procedures.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
