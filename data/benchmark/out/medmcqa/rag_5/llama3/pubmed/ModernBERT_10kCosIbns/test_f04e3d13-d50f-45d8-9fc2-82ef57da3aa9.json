["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about treating oral infections by penicillinase producing organisms. Penicillinase production is a common feature of Staphylococcus aureus, which is typically resistant to ordinary penicillin due to the enzyme's ability to break down penicillin. The relevant document is 'Penicillinase production in community strains of staphylococcus aureus'. According to this document, if the isolated aureus strain has been shown to be penicillinase-negative, then ordinary penicillin should be used for treatment. However, since oral infection by penicillinase producing organisms are concerned, it is unlikely that the isolate will be penicillinase-negative. Therefore, the recommended treatment would not be ordinary penicillin.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
