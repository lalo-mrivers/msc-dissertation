["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Upon reviewing the provided documents, I found that the 'Curve of Spee' is mentioned as an occlusal determinant that determines the relative cusp height and angulation of one tooth to another. Additionally, it is stated that the steepness of the curve of Spee determines the optimal height and angulation of the cusps. Therefore, considering this information, I deduced that the correct answer would be B: Curve of Spee.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
