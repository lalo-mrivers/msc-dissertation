["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the centric holding cusp. According to the documents provided, the cusp writer provides graphic evidence that the occlusal determinants which influence configurations are reciprocal, one tempering the value of the other. The steepness of the curve of Spee determines the relative cusp height and angulation of one tooth to another, from an anterior to a posterior direction in the dental arch. Therefore, the centric holding cusp can be determined by considering the optimal height and angulation of the cusps.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: Mesiopalatal cusp of maxillary 1st molar\"}"]
