["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the accurate sample size for this study, we need to first calculate the required number of cases using the formula: N = (Z^2 \\* p \\* q) / e^2. Where Z is the Z-score corresponding to the desired alpha error and power, p is the prevalence of the disease, q is the complement of the prevalence (1-p), and e is the relative precision.\n\nGiven that we want a 5% alpha error and a 20% relative precision, we can calculate the required number of cases:\n\nZ = Z-score corresponding to 95% confidence interval\n= 1.96\n\np = prevalence of the disease\n= 0.10\n\nq = complement of the prevalence\n= 0.90\n\ne = relative precision\n= 0.20 (as a proportion)\n\nN = (1.96^2 \\* 0.10 \\* 0.90) / (0.20)^2\n= 400\n\nSo, we need at least 400 cases to achieve the desired level of precision and confidence.\n\nNext, we need to consider the number of controls required for each case. Since the study is a case-control study, we typically want to have at least one control per case. Therefore, the total sample size would be:\n\nTotal Sample Size = Cases + Controls\n= 400 (cases) + 400 (controls)\n= 800\n\nHowever, since the disease prevalence is 10%, it's likely that there are many more controls than cases. To account for this, we can use the formula: Total Sample Size = N / p. This gives us:\n\nTotal Sample Size = 400 / 0.10\n= 4000\n\nThis suggests that we would need a much larger sample size to achieve our desired level of precision and confidence.\n\nFinally, we should note that these calculations are based on some simplifying assumptions, such as the assumption that the disease prevalence is constant across the population. In reality, this may not be the case, and additional considerations may be necessary to account for any variations in disease prevalence.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: 3600\""]
