["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about long-term assessment of glucose control. The provided documents discuss various aspects of glucose tolerance tests, including post-challenge glucose concentration, impaired glucose tolerance, diabetes, and cancer mortality. One document mentions the use of oral glucose challenges to assess glucose tolerance. Another document discusses differences between capillary and venous blood glucose during oral glucose tolerance tests. A third document presents plasma glucose, insulin, and triglyceride changes in response to a standard breakfast and an oral glucose tolerance test in normal, obese, and diabetic subjects. Based on these documents, it is clear that the long-term assessment of glucose control can be made by measuring blood sugar levels over time.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
