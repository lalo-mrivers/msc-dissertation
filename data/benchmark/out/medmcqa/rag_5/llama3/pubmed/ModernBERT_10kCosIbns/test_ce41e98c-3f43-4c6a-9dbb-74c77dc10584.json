["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the origin of extra-embryonic mesoderm. The relevant documents provided do not explicitly mention the formation of extra-embryonic mesoderm. However, we can infer that it is not derived from epiblast (choice A) as this term refers to the outer layer of cells in the blastula stage, which gives rise to the embryoblast. Similarly, primary yolk sac (choice B) and hypoblast (choice D) are terms used to describe the early stages of embryonic development, but they do not relate to extra-embryonic mesoderm. Therefore, we can conclude that extra-embryonic mesoderm is derived from secondary yolk sac (choice C).\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
