["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Since we are discussing occlusal forces transmitted to teeth in full tooth-borne dentures, the relevant document is 'Reactive force distributions for teeth when loaded singly and when used as fixed partial denture abutments'. This document explains that axial types of loads (which occur in tooth-borne dentures) produce compressive stresses on the periodontium. The text does not specifically mention occlusal rests, but it suggests that teeth are evolved to carry axial types of loads, which means that most of the force is transmitted to the teeth. Therefore, we can conclude that a significant percentage of occlusal forces is transmitted to the teeth.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: 100%\""]
