["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the question, we can see that a recently delivered woman with a 15 days old child is suffering from cough, sneezing, and fever. The woman has no money for transportation to nearby hospital. We need to identify a national program that can help her.

One document discusses chronic diseases in children, another discusses hospital-acquired infections, and the last one discusses various health problems and service use by parents of normal infants.
