According to this study, there are three venous nets in the muscular layer of the EGTS: perimuscular, intermuscular, and submuscular. These three nets converge at the extremities of the EGTS to large confluent trunks that go out of the organ through perforating trunks, mainly to the affluents of the portal vein. A marked predominance of perforating vasa of the false type in zone 3 suggests that the muscular layer may be a barrier between the deep and peripheral venous circulation of the esophagus.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
