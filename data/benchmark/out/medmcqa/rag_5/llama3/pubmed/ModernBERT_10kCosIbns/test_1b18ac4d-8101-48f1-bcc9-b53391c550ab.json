["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Acetazolamide is a non-competitive inhibitor of carbonic anhydrase enzyme. This means it does not compete with the substrate for the active site of the enzyme, but instead binds to the enzyme itself and prevents it from functioning. As a result, it decreases the activity of carbonic anhydrase. The enzyme's function is to catalyze the reaction that produces aqueous humor in the eye. By decreasing its activity, acetazolamide reduces the production of aqueous humor, which increases intraocular pressure. Therefore, the effect of this drug should be a decrease in Vmax.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
