["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question describes an infant with vomiting and malnutrition. The Guthrie test being positive suggests a diagnosis of phenylketonuria (PKU). PKU is caused by a deficiency of the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase, which converts phenylalanine into tyrosine. This leads to an accumulation of phenylalanine in the blood and urine. The question asks what is NOT true about this disease, so we need to look for options that are not characteristic of PKU.\n\nOption B mentions white patch of hair due to tryptophan deficiency, which is not related to PKU. Option A correctly states that the disease is caused by a Phenylalanine hydroxylase enzyme defect, which is the definition of PKU. Option C is also correct as phenyl acetate can be detected in the urine of individuals with PKU. Therefore, option D 'Mental retardation is present' is not true about this disease.\n\nThere is no mention of tryptophan deficiency or white patch of hair in any of the provided documents, which suggests that these are not related to the case.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
