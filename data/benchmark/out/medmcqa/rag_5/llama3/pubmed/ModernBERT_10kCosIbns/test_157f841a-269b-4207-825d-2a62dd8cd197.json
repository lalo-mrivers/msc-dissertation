["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the document 'Steroid production by definitive and fetal zones of the human fetal adrenal gland', we can see that the main secretory product of the fetal zone is DHEA-S (dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate). Additionally, from the document 'Biosynthetic pathways for corticoids and androgen formation in human fetal adrenal tissue in vitro', we know that the order of magnitudes of enzyme activity when progesterone was used as a substrate and incubated with midterm fetal adrenals was 17alpha-hydroxylase, 21-hydroxylase, and 16alpha-hydroxylase. This suggests that the fetus adrenal has the capacity to produce corticoids like cortisol.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
