["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about a type of resistance form in endodontics. The first document provides a general overview of success and failure in endodontics, but does not specifically mention 'resistance form'. The second document discusses referrals to dentists who limit their practices to endodontics, which is not relevant to the question. The third document mentions surgical wound healing as it relates to soft tissue management procedures, but this does not seem related to resistance forms in endodontics either.

Based on the provided documents, there is no clear mention of resistance forms in endodontics.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
