["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about trimming gutta percha before sealing the coronal area. The relevant document that provides information on periodontal grafting procedures includes discussions on subgingival and irregular restoration margins having an unfavourable influence on the marginal periodont. This suggests that in cases of gingival recession, restoration margins should be supragingival to avoid complications. Since the question focuses on trimming gutta percha before sealing the coronal area, it is likely that the answer will relate to the position of the restoration margin relative to the gingiva. The 'Coronally repositioned periodontal flap' document describes a procedure for increasing the width of attached gingiva by free palatal mucosa transplants and coronally repositioning flaps. This suggests that the focus is on supragingival positioning of restorations rather than subgingival restoration margins. Therefore, it can be inferred that the gutta percha should be trimmed back to a position above the level of the recession, such as 1 mm below the ACJ or 1 mm below the roof of pulpal chamber.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
