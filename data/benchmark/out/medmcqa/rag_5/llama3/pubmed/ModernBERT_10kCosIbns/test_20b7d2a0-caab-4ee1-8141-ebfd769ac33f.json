["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the transfer of hinge opening axis. There are several documents provided, but none of them directly address this specific topic. However, one document talks about hinge-type artificial knee joints and their characteristics. Another document describes a hinge-distraction apparatus used to restore movement in joints. One more document discusses the use of a hinge distraction apparatus after arthrolysis or arthroplasty. None of these documents provide information on transfer of hinge opening axis being compulsory for any specific condition. Therefore, we must look at the other available information. The 'Located hinge-axis or conventional hinge-axis?' study talks about the influence of locating the horizontal transverse axis of rotation of the mandible and its impact on functional analysis of occlusion. This does not seem relevant to the transfer of hinge opening axis. None of the documents provide a direct link between hinge opening axis transfer and any specific condition.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
