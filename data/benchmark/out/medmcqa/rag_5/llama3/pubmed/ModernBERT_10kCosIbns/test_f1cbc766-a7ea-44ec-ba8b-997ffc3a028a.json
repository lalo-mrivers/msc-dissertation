["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 3.5 kg term male baby with respiratory distress at birth, which did not respond to surfactant. The ECHO finding revealed nothing abnormal, and X-ray showed a ground glass appearance, which was culture negative. The Apgars were 4 and 5 at 1 and 5 minutes.
