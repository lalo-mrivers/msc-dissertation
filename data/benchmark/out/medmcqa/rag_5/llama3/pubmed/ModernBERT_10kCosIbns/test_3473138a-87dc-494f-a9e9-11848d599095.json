["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The property by which the transformation from sol to gel and gel to sol occurs is related to the physical properties of the hydrocolloid. The question specifically asks about reversible hydrocolloid, which undergoes a sol-gel-sol transition. Reversible hydrocolloids are sensitive to temperature. The papers provided mention several studies on irreversible hydrocolloids, but none that explicitly discuss the property controlling the transformation in reversible hydrocolloids. However, we can draw an analogy from the paper 'Molecular motion of drugs in hydrocolloids measured by electron paramagnetic resonance' which talks about the rotational correlation times (tau) indicating proportionality of the microviscosity of hydrocolloids to the polymer concentration and local environment conditioned by free spaces between polymer molecules. This suggests that temperature could be an important factor in reversible hydrocolloid's sol-gel-sol transition.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
