["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"There are no relevant documents that directly address the question of which specific drugs can be stopped abruptly without withdrawal symptoms. However, we can consider general information about adverse drug reactions and withdrawal syndromes. The first document states that only 4 instances were found where the incidence of symptoms was significantly higher in patients taking a particular drug than in those not taking it, suggesting that many reported side effects may have other causes. The second document reports on adverse reactions to drugs in general practice and notes that more patients given drugs acting on the central nervous system and antihistamines reported reactions. The third document discusses pharmacological adjuncts for treating withdrawal syndromes, emphasizing the importance of considering alternative explanations for symptoms during the withdrawal period. Finally, the fourth document reviews 827 cases of adverse drug reactions and death, noting that many ADRs had critical roles played by nondrug factors.\n\nGiven this information, it is not possible to determine which specific drugs can be stopped abruptly without withdrawal symptoms. Instead, we should focus on general principles for managing withdrawal syndromes and considering the potential impact of multiple factors on reported side effects.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"None\"\n}"]
