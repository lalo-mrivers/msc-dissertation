["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"This question is related to the morphology of mandibular premolars. We have relevant documents on the root canal morphology of mandibular premolars. The document 'Root canal morphology of mandibular premolars' states that mandibular first premolar had one canal at the apex in 74.0% of the teeth, two canals at the apex in 25.5%, and three canals at the apex in 0.5% of the teeth. This information is not relevant to the current question. The document 'Furcation anatomy of the first mandibular molar in dogs' describes the furcation area of the first mandibular molar, which does not seem relevant to this question either.\n\nThe document '[The relations of the mandibular canal with the outer surfaces of the body of the mandible and the risks which arise from its injury]' discusses the position and course of the mandibular canal, but it does not provide information about the access cavity of a mandibular 1st molar. The same is true for the document 'The position and course of the mandibular canal'.\n\nAs there are no relevant documents on the root canal morphology or furcation anatomy of mandibular first molars, we can conclude that this information is not available in our given documents.\n\nTherefore, based on our step-by-step thinking, we should select option D: None of the above.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
