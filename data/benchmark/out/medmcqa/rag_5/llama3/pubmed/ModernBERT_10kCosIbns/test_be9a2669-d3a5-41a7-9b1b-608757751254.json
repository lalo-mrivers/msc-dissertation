["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the temperature at which RBCs (Red Blood Cells) are stored. From the provided documents, we can find information on storage temperatures for blood samples and heparinized whole blood. In the first document, 'Stability of pO2, pCO2 and pH in heparinized whole blood samples: influence of storage temperature with regard to leukocyte count and syringe material', it is mentioned that glass samplers with blood stored in ice water served as the reference, which suggests a storage temperature around 0-4째C. Additionally, in 'Favourable effect of storage at 0 degrees C on the O2 transport function of heparinized blood', it is stated that the biological value of heparinized blood decreases less when stored at 0째C than at +4째C. This suggests that RBCs are likely stored around 0-4째C.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B: 2-6 degC\"\n}"]
