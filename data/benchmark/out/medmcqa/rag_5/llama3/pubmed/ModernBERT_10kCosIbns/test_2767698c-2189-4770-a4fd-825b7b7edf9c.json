["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The study on The Merkel cell in oral human mucosa mentions that the cell contains features of neurons and amine-storage cells, suggesting a role in sensory perception. The study on Early development of human Merkel cells states that they are localized above the basal layer and have round to oval shape with dendrites being infrequent and short, which is consistent with their role in sensory reception. The study on Human Merkel cell regeneration in skin derived from cultured keratinocyte grafts notes that regenerating Merkel cells were never innervated, suggesting that they do not rely on neural induction for function. The study on The distribution of Merkel cells in human fetal and adult skin states that Merkel cells are most numerous on volar skin and least on genital skin, which is consistent with their role in tactile sensation.\", \"answer_choice\": A}"]
