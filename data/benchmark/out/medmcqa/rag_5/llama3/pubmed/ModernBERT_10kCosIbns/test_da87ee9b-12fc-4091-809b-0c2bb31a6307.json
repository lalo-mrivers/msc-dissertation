["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The document 'The fate of amalgam implanted in soft tissues -- an experimental study.' states that finely ground amalgam was actively digested within macrophages and giant-cells with loss of mercury and the formation of the fine particles of silver and sulphur. This suggests that mechanical trituration (finely grinding) affects the final form or structure of the amalgam. The document '[Dental amalgam: the materials.]' mentions that a set amalgam is a dynamic material that undergoes many microstructural changes during clinical use, related to both the elevated temperature and corrosion-prone environment in the mouth and mechanical forces applied to the restoration. This implies that mechanical trituration can cause structural changes in the amalgam.\",\n\"answer_choice\": A\n}"]
