["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for a poor prognostic indicator of Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL). After reviewing the relevant documents, I did not find any information that directly addresses this topic. However, considering the provided options, I will analyze them based on general medical knowledge and available literature.\n\nOption A: Female sex is not necessarily a poor prognostic indicator of ALL, as studies have shown that survival rates for children with ALL are similar between males and females.\n\nOption B: Leukocyte count < 50,000 is a common laboratory finding in patients with acute leukemia, including ALL. However, it does not specifically indicate poor prognosis.\n\nOption C: Age greater than 1 year may be a relevant factor, as older children tend to have poorer outcomes compared to younger children.\n\nOption D: Hypodiploidy (having fewer than 46 chromosomes) is a known poor prognostic indicator in ALL, especially when combined with other adverse factors such as high white blood cell count or presence of central nervous system involvement.\n\nBased on this analysis, I would conclude that Option D, Hypodiploidy, is the most plausible answer.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
