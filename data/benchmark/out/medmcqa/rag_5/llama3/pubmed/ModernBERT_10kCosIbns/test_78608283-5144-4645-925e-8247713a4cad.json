["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the development of granules in a cell before ovulation. The relevant documents mention RNA synthesis in mouse oocytes, hormonal induction of maturation in amphibian oocytes, and quantitation of nexus junctions in rabbit ovarian follicles during ovulation. Nexus junctions are related to surface nexuses and interiorized nexuses, which seem to be influenced by the rate of granulosa cell division and formation of new nexuses. There is no mention of estrogen, progesterone, FSH, or LH influencing the development of granules in cells before ovulation. Therefore, the correct answer must be a process that is not related to hormone regulation.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"None of the above\""]
