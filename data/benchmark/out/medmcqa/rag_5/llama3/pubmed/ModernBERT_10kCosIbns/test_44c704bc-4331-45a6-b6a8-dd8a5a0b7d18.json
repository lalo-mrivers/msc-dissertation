["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the provided documents, we know that the hypothalamus is involved in various regulatory processes including temperature regulation, feeding, drinking, electrolyte balance, and sleeping-waking cycle. It also receives influences from other parts of the nervous system and sends efferent impulses to the neurohypophysis, back along limbic pathways to the cortex, and down to the autonomic centers in the brain stem.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe document '[On Endocrine Hypothalamic Systems (authors transl)]' discusses the importance results of neuroendocrinology as far as hypothalamus and hypophysis are concerned. It does not mention any specific hormone under inhibitory control of the hypothalamus.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, the document 'MR anatomy and pathology of the hypothalamus' does not provide information relevant to the question either.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe only relevant information comes from '[The endocrine hypothalamus]', which mentions that some peptide hormones in connection with the hypothalamic topography, close interrelationship in the vegetative brain centre of a number of specialized neuronal nuclei with unknown hormonal activity give an example of a highly developed system of homeostatic function regulation.\\r\\n\\r\\nBased on this information, it seems that the hypothalamus plays a role in regulating various physiological processes through peptide hormones. However, there is no specific mention of prolactin or growth hormone being under inhibitory control of the hypothalamus.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
