["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents do not provide direct information about the isolation period of measles. However, they do describe clinical signs, symptoms, and epidemiological characteristics of measles. Based on this information, it can be inferred that the isolation period is likely to include the time when an individual is contagious and may spread the disease. This would typically include the prodromal stage and the eruptive stage, which are described in the documents as including fever, cough, and rash. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the isolation period would be at least several days, possibly up to 7 days.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
