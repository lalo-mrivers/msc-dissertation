["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the characteristics of pulp cells, including those found in the outermost zone of the pulp. The Ultrastructural study of human pulp cells cultured in vitro mentions the presence of odontoblast-like cells with a cilium, highly developed endoplasmic reticulum, and dense secretion vesicles containing cross-striated filamentous material. This is similar to the characteristics described for odontoblasts. Additionally, the Establishment of primary cultures of pulp cells from bovine permanent incisors mentions that the long-term cultured cells formed nodules that were slightly mineralized, a characteristic also found in odontoblasts.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
