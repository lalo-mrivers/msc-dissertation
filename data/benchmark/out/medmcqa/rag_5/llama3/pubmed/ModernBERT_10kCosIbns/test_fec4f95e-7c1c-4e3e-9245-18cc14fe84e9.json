["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the factors that increase acetylcholine release from the presynaptic membrane. According to the 'Release of acetylcholine and its regulation' document, ACh release is triggered by calcium influx through specific presynaptic Ca2+ channels. Therefore, blocking voltage gated Ca+ channels on presynaptic membrane would reduce or block this influx, which in turn would decrease ACh release.\", \"answer_choice\": B}"]
