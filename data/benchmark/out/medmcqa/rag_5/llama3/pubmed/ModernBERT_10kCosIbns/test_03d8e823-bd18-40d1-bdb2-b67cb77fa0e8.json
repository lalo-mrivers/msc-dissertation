["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the given documents, we can see that FSGS (Focal Segmental Glomerulohyalinosis) is a morphological variant of primary glomerulonephritis that has nephrotic forms. Similarly, MPGN (Mesangiocapillary Glomerulonephritis) also has nephrotic syndrome as one of its clinical manifestations. Post-infectious Glomerulonephritis can present with nephrotic syndrome in some cases. Minimal Change Disease is a type of primary glomerulonephritis that is characterized by foot process effacement and presents with proteinuria, but it does not typically have nephrotic syndrome.
