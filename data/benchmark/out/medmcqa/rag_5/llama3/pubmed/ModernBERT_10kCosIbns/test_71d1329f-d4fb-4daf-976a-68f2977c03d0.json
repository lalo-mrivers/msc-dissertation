["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, we can rule out options A (prolonged curing cycle) and D (prolonged bench cooling after curing) as they are not related to porosity present in an acrylic denture. Option C (insufficient acrylic resin monomer) is also unlikely to cause porosity, as it would more likely result in a softer or weaker denture.\n\nThe most plausible explanation for porosity in an acrylic denture is the lack of sufficient pressure applied during the flasking process (option B). This is because insufficient pressure can lead to air bubbles being trapped within the resin, resulting in porosity. The documents do not specifically mention porosity, but they do discuss issues with denture base processing and dimensional accuracy.\", \n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
