["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the type of strain that develops when a force is applied perpendicular to a surface. The relevant documents describe various types of loads, stresses, and strains in different contexts. In 'Stress wave effects...' document, impulsive loading is mentioned, but it's not directly related to the perpendicular force application. In 'The dramatic influence of loading velocity...' document, compression tests are described, which also don't relate directly to the question. The 'Shear properties...' document discusses shear moduli and strain rates, but it doesn't explicitly mention forces applied perpendicular to a surface. However, in 'Finite element stress analysis...' document, axisymmetric models and various loadings (including axial compression force) are discussed. This suggests that when a force is applied perpendicular to the surface, compressive strain would develop.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
