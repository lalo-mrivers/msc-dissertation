["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The primary site of action of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) is where it binds to specific receptors on renal collecting tubule cells, stimulates adenylyl cyclase and promotes the cyclic AMP-mediated incorporation of water pores into the luminal surface of these cells. This information can be found in the document 'Molecular cloning of the receptor for human antidiuretic hormone'. Therefore, the primary site of action of ADH is on the renal collecting tubules.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
