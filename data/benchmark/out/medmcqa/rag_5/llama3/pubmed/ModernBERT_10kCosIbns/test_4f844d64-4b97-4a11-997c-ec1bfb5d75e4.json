["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about a class II die 1 malocclusion of a 14-year-old boy, which requires the detection of tooth extraction. Based on the study 'A study of occlusal anomalies and tooth loss in children aged 13-15 years in Nairobi', we know that the most frequently encountered anomaly was crowding, followed by missing teeth due to caries, extractions as part of orthodontic treatment, and other reasons. Since the boy is 14 years old, it's likely that his case involves a similar scenario.\n\nFrom 'A ranking scale of the susceptibility to loss of various types of teeth as an additional aid to the decision for the extraction of permanent teeth in orthodontic treatments', we can see that this scale provides a statistically established rank scale of the predisposition to decay of different types of teeth, which helps evaluate the sacrifice of masticatory units in orthodontically indicated tooth extraction.\n\nConsidering 'Tooth mortality and endodontic status of a selected population group. Observations before and after treatment.', we know that tooth extractions were performed in 48% of patients, mostly in the maxilla, with 47% of extracted teeth being molars.\n\nFinally, 'Impacted canine teeth' suggests that evaluation of supernumerary, impacted, and malposed teeth is necessary to correct pathologic conditions and prevent future problems. This points towards considering the potential for tooth extraction based on the boy's specific condition.\", \n\"answer_choice\": D"]
