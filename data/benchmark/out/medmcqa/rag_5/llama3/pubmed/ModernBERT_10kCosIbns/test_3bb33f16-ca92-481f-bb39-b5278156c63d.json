["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has increased PT, APTT & TT, but normal fibrinogen and platelet counts. This is a classic combination of laboratory findings that suggests the presence of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). DIC is a condition characterized by uncontrolled activation of the clotting cascade, leading to the formation of blood clots in various organs.\n\nThe patient's laboratory results do not suggest any other causes of increased PT, APTT & TT, such as liver disease or vitamin K deficiency. Factor VIII deficiency would be expected to cause prolonged APTT, but not increased PT and TT.\n\nTherefore, based on the patient's laboratory findings, the most likely diagnosis is DIC.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
