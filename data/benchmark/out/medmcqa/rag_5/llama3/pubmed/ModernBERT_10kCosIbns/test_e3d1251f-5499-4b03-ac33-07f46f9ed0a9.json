["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about mandibular first molar. We have to find out which option is related to extra distal root. From the given documents, we don't see any mention of Tomt's root or Radix paramolaris. But we do find information about radicular anatomy of mandibular first molar in dogs. According to that document, there are mesial (MR) and distal (DR) roots with a mean distance from the beginning of the root trunk to the furcation being 2.1 mm.
