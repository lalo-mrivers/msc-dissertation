["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, it can be seen that the detachment of myosin head from actin is caused by the binding of ATP. This is evident from the kinetic studies on the association and dissociation of myosin subfragment 1 and actin, which show that the interaction between the ligand and actin binding sites reduces the rate constant of the isomerization step (k2) from 2000 for A*M to approximately unity for A*M-pyrophosphate. This suggests that the binding of ATP causes a conformational change in the myosin head, leading to its detachment from actin.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
