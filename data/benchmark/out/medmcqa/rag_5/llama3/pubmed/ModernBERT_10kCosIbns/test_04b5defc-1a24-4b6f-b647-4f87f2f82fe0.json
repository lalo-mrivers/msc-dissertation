["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the insertion of three muscles (Gracilis, Sartorius and semitendinous) into the tibia. According to the provided documents, we can see that Gracilis muscle inserts onto the tibia, as stated in [Gracilis muscle in man]. Moreover, its distal tendon is tightly connected to the posterior branch of the internal saphenous nerve which crosses the muscle behind the medial femoral condyle. This information suggests that the insertion site of Gracilis muscle into the tibia is not unique to this muscle alone, but rather shared with another muscle (semitendinous). Therefore, we can infer that Pes anserinus, a structure formed by the tendons of these three muscles inserting onto the tibia, is likely to be associated with the muscles that form it.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
