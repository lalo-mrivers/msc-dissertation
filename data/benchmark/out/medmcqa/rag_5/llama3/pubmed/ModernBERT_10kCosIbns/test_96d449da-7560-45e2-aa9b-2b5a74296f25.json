["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about true statements about ythT cells. Since the given documents are about T-cell development, ontogeny, and regulation, I will consider these facts to answer the question. There is no mention of helper T cells in the provided documents. Oligoclonal proliferation refers to the generation of a few different clones or cell populations from a single population. This concept is not directly related to ythT cells. Antigen presentation is a function performed by dendritic cells and macrophages, not specifically ythT cells. Opsonization is a process where antibodies coat foreign particles making them more susceptible to phagocytosis. However, this process is not specific to ythT cells either. Therefore, none of the given options match true statements about ythT cells.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"None of the above\""]
