["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the maximum voltage of R wave in an ECG. The mean axis is 90 degrees, which suggests that the vectorcardiogram (VCG) would be helpful in understanding this information. From the given documents, we can infer that the VCG provides information about the position and magnitude of a given vector. In this case, the maximum voltage of R wave corresponds to the left maximum spatial vector. The document 'Angular velocity of the QRS loop of the vectrocardiogram in the normal heart' describes the rotation movement of the QRS loop at intervals of 2.5 msecs and calculates angular velocity expressed in radians/sec. This information is useful in determining the position of the vector. As the mean axis is 90 degrees, it can be inferred that the maximum voltage of R wave would occur in a plane where the vector has its maximum spatial magnitude.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B: I\""]
