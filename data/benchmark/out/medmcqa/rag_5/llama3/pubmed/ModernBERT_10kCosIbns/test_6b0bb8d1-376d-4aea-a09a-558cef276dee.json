["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The articles discuss the usefulness of myoglobin as a biochemical marker for detecting acute myocardial infarction (MI). In 'Radioimmunoassay of serum myoglobin: evaluation and modification of a commercial kit and assessment of its usefulness for detecting acute myocardial infarction', it is mentioned that myoglobinemia was present in most patients with acute MI, but information on its presence was less useful clinically than the detection of creatine kinase isoenzyme MB. This suggests that CPK MB might be a better marker for MI. In 'Detection of early myocardial infarction by radioimmunoassay of myoglobin', it is mentioned that myoglobinemia proved to be a sensitive index of early myocardial damage, perhaps superseding the enzyme CPK in detecting early myocardial damage. This suggests that myoglobin might be a better marker for early MI detection. In 'An enzyme-immunoassay for myoglobin in human serum and urine', it is mentioned that all 8 patients with definite acute myocardial infarction had raised serum myoglobin levels, which returned to normal in 6 patients after treatment. This suggests that myoglobin concentration can be used to monitor the extent of MI. In 'Detection of myoglobin by radioimmunoassay in human sera: its usefulness and limitations as an emergency room screening test for acute myocardial infarction', it is mentioned that serum myoglobin determinations may be obtained by radioimmunoassay utilizing time periods for the testing which allow more useful clinical evaluation of patients. This suggests that myoglobin can be used to monitor MI in the Emergency Room. Overall, it seems that myoglobin might be a better marker for detecting acute MI than CPK.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
