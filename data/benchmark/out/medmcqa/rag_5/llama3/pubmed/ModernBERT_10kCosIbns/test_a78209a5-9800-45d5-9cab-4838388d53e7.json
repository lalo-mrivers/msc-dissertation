["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The passage 'Cast vs. wrought cobalt-chromium surgical implant alloys' suggests that the resistance to crevice corrosion at metal-Teflon contacts is greater for wrought HS21 compared to as-cast HS21, wrought HS25, wrought MP35, or 316L stainless steel. This implies that the presence of certain elements in the alloy composition contributes to its resistance to corrosion. The passage 'Corrosion behavior of cast and forged cobalt-based alloys' mentions that besides being resistant to pitting and crevice attack, the implant material must be highly resistant to wear and abrasion. Although this doesn't directly mention the resistance to corrosion in a cobalt-chrome casting, it suggests that the alloy composition plays a crucial role in determining its mechanical and corrosion properties.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
