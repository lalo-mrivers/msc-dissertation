["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the composition of saliva and its relation to blood plasma concentrations. The document 'Drug concentration in saliva' states that saliva flow rate and pH can affect drug concentrations. The document 'On the distribution of drugs in saliva and blood plasma' discusses the equilibration of drug concentrations between blood plasma and saliva, mentioning esterases in human saliva. This suggests that there is an acid neutralizing substance present in saliva. The document 'Esterases in human saliva' mentions carboxylesterases (EC 3.1.1.1) which are known to be responsible for the breakdown of esters, including those containing bicarbonate. Therefore, it can be inferred that bicarbonate is an acid neutralizing substance present in saliva.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
