["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the provided documents, we know that enzymes from myocardial infarction were studied. The document '[Serum and myocardial enzyme activity in experimental myocardial infarct]' states that 'in myocardial infarction the activity of heart muscle enzymes decreases significantly and persistently in the zone of necrosis'. This suggests that creatine phosphokinase (CPK) might be an early rising enzyme as it is a marker for muscle damage. Additionally, the document '[Accumulated creatine phosphokinase release as a prognostic index in the course of acute myocardial infarction]' specifically studies CPK release in patients with acute transmural myocardial infarction.\",\n\"answer_choice\": A"]
