["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The child can walk upstairs one step at a time, which suggests some degree of motor control and coordination. They can also ride a cycle, indicating further development of gross motor skills. However, the fact that they cannot jump implies that their overall motor abilities may be somewhat limited. The ability to speak sentences is a significant milestone in language development, suggesting an age of around 3-4 years. The child's difficulty with narrating a story suggests that they may not have fully developed narrative skills, which are typically acquired between the ages of 4-5 years.\n\nConsidering these factors, it seems likely that the child's actual developmental age is closer to 3-4 years than 1-2 years. However, without more specific information about their cognitive and language abilities, it is difficult to pinpoint an exact age.\", \n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
