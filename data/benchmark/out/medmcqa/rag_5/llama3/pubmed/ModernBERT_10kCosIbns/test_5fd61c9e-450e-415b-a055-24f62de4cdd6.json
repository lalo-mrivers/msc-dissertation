["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about what should not be done in case of wider osteotomy planned. The relevant documents provided are related to various types of osteotomies, including interdental osteotomy, repositioning of dental-osseous elements, and complications of osteotomies. None of the documents specifically mention wider implant or bone graft plus implant. However, it is mentioned in [Complications of osteotomies] that the list of possible complications is extensive and often based on single case-reports. Therefore, it can be inferred that performing a wide osteotomy may lead to potential complications. Deepening an existing osteotomy (Option D) is also not recommended as it would increase the complexity of the procedure. Pressing buccal and lingual plate (Option A) seems to be an incorrect option as there is no mention of this in any of the provided documents.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
