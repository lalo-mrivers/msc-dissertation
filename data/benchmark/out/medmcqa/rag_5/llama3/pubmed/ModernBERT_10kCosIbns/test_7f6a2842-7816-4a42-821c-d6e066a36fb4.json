["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents provide information on perinatal HIV transmission. The rate of transmission is established to be between 15% and 25%. Since the question asks about the percentage of mother-to-child transmission of HIV during delivery without intervention in a non-breast-fed child, we can infer that this refers to intrapartum transmission. According to Vertical Transmission, there are ongoing debates about whether intrauterine exposure poses the greatest risk or if infection could occur at or around the time of delivery. However, considering the rate of perinatal transmission established earlier, it is reasonable to assume that the percentage of mother-to-child transmission during delivery without intervention in a non-breast-fed child would fall within this range.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C: 15-30%\""]
