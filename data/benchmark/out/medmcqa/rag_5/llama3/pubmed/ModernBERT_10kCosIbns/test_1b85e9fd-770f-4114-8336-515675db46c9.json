["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, it is clear that embryonic development is a complex process involving the formation of different cell types and tissues. The concept of target cells in oncogenesis suggests that immature elements from both proliferating and non-proliferating tissues serve as target cells for neoplasms. This information does not directly relate to the question about the absence of precursor cells and organ development. However, the document 'Immunohistochemical characterization of primitive neuroectodermal tumors' provides insight into the stepwise ontogenetic development of the central nervous system. The text describes the expression of different markers during embryonic development, including chromogranin A, NSE, and synaptophysin. This information suggests that the absence of precursor cells leading to non-development of an organ may be related to the concept of agenesis.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
