["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the advantages of high pressure oxygen through cannula. From the given documents, we can see that high pressure oxygen through cannula would not have any obvious advantage related to bypassing nasopharyngeal dead space (A) as this document doesn't mention anything about that. Nor would it decrease need for intubation (B), as cannulas are used for patients who cannot tolerate an endotracheal tube. It also wouldn't provide PEEP (C), which is a technique to keep the airway pressure high to prevent alveoli from collapsing, and is not related to oxygen delivery through cannula. The only thing left is D: Hot and Humidification of air.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
