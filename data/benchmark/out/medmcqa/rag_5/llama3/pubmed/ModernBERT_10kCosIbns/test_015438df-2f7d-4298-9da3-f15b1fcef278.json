["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the characteristics of polymerization shrinkage of composite. According to the provided documents, particularly the 'Effects of polymerization contraction in composite restorations' and 'Determination of polymerization shrinkage kinetics in visible-light-cured materials: methods development', we can deduce that the overall time constant for polymerization shrinkage varies among different materials, ranging from 12.5 to 280 seconds. Moreover, the study suggests that the initial shrinkage is near-linear in time for many materials. Additionally, it is mentioned that post-gel polymerization contraction of resin composite induces contraction stresses at the composite-tooth bond and in surrounding tooth structure.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
