["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Upon reviewing the relevant documents, I notice that the topic of exercise is discussed extensively. One section that catches my attention is 'Exercise: Part II' where it talks about the physiology of exercises and its effects on energy production. It mentions that as intensity exceeds the anaerobic threshold, anaerobic glycolysis is inhibited, forcing a decrease in exercise intensity. This suggests that the physiological responses to exercise are complex and involve multiple systems. Another section that's relevant is 'Optimal function and health' where it emphasizes the importance of regular physical activity for optimal function of many vital organs and tissues. With this information, I can infer that during exercise, there would be changes in blood flow, body temperature, and lymphatic flow. Given the complexity of physiological responses to exercise, I'm going to rely on the scientific evidence provided to make an informed decision.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
