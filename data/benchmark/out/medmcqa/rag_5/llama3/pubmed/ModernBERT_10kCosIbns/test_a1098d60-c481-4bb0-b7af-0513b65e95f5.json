["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about which heart sound indicates stiffness of ventricular wall. The provided documents discuss the mechanical correlates of the third heart sound (S3). In the document 'Mechanical correlates of the third heart sound', it is mentioned that the peak frequency of the wall vibrations increased with increased diastolic pressure, probably reflecting an increase in myocardial wall stiffness.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"]
