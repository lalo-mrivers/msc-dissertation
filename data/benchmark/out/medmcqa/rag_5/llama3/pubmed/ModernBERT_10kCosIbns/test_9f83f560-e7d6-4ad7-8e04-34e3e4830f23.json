["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant document describing the extracranial arteries does not provide information on where the common carotid artery divides. The paper 'Angiographic evaluation of the internal carotid artery' does not address this specific topic either. However, the document '[Electrocardiographic changes after surgical manipulation of the carotid arteries (author's transl)]' describes the carotid arteries and does not mention any information on where the common carotid artery divides.
