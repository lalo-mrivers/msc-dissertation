["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for the tetanizing frequency of a muscle twitch. The latent period, contraction time, and relaxation time are provided as 10 ms, 40 ms, and 50 ms respectively. Tetanization occurs when multiple stimuli are applied at a rapid rate, effectively eliminating the latent period. Since the contraction and relaxation times are fixed, we can use the fact that the muscle fiber needs to relax for half of its total contraction time (50 ms) to determine the minimum frequency required for tetanization. This is because any faster stimulation would not allow the muscle fiber to fully relax before being stimulated again. Therefore, we can set up an equation where the relaxation time is equal to the period between two stimuli: 50 ms = 1/f, where f is the frequency. Solving for f gives us a minimum frequency of approximately 100 Hz.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
