["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the characteristics of cells found in human dental pulp. We know that these cells are capable of secreted a collagenous matrix with random fibrillar distribution, fusiform outlines of fibrils, and cross-striation of 640 A. They also have electron dense structures united by a fibre with periodic cross-striation of 640 A. Additionally, they produce globules with trilamellar membrane of about 110 A in the extracellular medium. This suggests that these cells are multipotent or capable of differentiating into multiple cell types.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
