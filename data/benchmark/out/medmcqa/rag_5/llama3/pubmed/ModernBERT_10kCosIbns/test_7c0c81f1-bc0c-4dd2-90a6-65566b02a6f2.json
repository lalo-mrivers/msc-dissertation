["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The provided documents discuss bisphosphonates and their interaction with calcium ions. Bisacylphosphonates are mentioned to inhibit hydroxyapatite formation and dissolution in vitro and dystrophic calcification in vivo. Quantum chemical study on the interaction of some bisphosphonates and Ca2+ also provides information on the binding geometry of these compounds. However, there is no specific mention of cells with greatest affinity to bisphosphonates. Therefore, we need to analyze the general mechanism of action of bisphosphonates.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
