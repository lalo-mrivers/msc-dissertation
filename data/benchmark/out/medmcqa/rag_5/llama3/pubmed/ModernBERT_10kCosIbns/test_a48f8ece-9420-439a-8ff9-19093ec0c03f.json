["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about basic fear of a 2-year-old child during his first visit to the dentist. We can look at the documents provided for clues. One document mentions that children who reported painful treatment and perceived lack of control at the dentist were more likely to report high fear. Another document suggests that specific instances which contributed to fear of dentistry in 75% of cases could be identified by parents.

The question is asking about basic fear during the first visit, so it's likely related to initial experiences.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
