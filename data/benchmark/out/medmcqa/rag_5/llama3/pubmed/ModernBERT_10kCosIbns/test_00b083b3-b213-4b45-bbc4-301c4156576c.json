["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"After reviewing the provided documents, I noticed that the 'inductograph' graphically describes the limits of the latent phase of induced labour. This suggests that the latent phase begins before the active phase and is a part of the first stage of labour (Option B). The other options do not directly contradict any information from the documents. However, upon reviewing the documents again, I found that the 'Normal and abnormal labor progress' article mentions cervicometric data for nulliparous and multiparous labor, but it does not specify a particular cervical dilatation threshold to initiate the latent phase.
