["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents provide information on muscle spindle characteristics, morphology, and physiology. The relevant findings are that primary and secondary endings tend to fall silent during active shortening of the receptor-bearing muscles, but resume firing when the shortening is halted. In isometric voluntary contractions, the discharge of spindle endings accelerates with increasing contraction strength, and the threshold for activation varies between different endings. There is no correlation found between the sensitivity of a spindle to external length changes and its ease of activation in a voluntary contraction.\n\nThe provided question asks about faulty statements regarding muscle spindle. The options suggest that there are specific properties or characteristics of certain types of muscle spindle fibers. However, none of these options are supported by the provided documents. Therefore, I will examine each option to identify which one is likely to be incorrect:\n\nOption A: Central zone has no actin and myosin - This statement is not supported by any of the provided documents.\n\nOption B: Type 1 nuclear bag fibres has low myosin ATPase activity - No information on type 1 nuclear bag fibers or their ATPase activity is provided in the given documents.\n\nOption C: Peripheral zone has no actin and myosin - This statement is also not supported by any of the provided documents.\n\nOption D: Type 2 nuclear bag has high level of myosin ATPase activity - No information on type 2 nuclear bag fibers or their ATPase activity is provided in the given documents.\n\nBased on this analysis, I conclude that options A and C are likely to be incorrect. Therefore, I will choose option A as the most faulty statement regarding muscle spindle.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
