["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about cast cobalt alloys. We need to find the statement that is NOT true for these alloys. The documents provided give us information about cobalt's properties and its use in various applications. From the 'Dissolution of cobalt from hard metal alloys by cutting fluids' document, we can infer that cobalt has certain health hazards associated with it. However, this doesn't directly relate to the modulus of elasticity, rigidity, ductility, or proportional limit of cast cobalt alloys.\n\nFrom the 'High strength Co-Cr-Mo alloy by hot isostatic pressing of powder' document, we can see that the new process for preparing prostheses involves a specific method of consolidation and results in high-strength materials with ultrafine grain size. However, this doesn't provide any direct information about the modulus of elasticity, rigidity, ductility, or proportional limit of cast cobalt alloys.\n\nFrom the 'Solubility of cobalt in cement' document, we can learn that cobalt oxides are not water-soluble and that cobalt is more readily dissolved by forming complexes in eczematous skin than in normal skin. This information doesn't directly relate to the mechanical properties of cast cobalt alloys.\n\nThe 'The hard metal diseases' document provides information about the health hazards associated with cobalt exposure, but this doesn't provide any direct information about the modulus of elasticity, rigidity, ductility, or proportional limit of cast cobalt alloys.\n\nFinally, from the 'Determination of radioactive and stable cobalt in marine biological materials (author's transl)' document, we can learn that cobalt can be extracted and measured using certain methods. However, this doesn't provide any direct information about the mechanical properties of cast cobalt alloys.\n\nAfter careful consideration of all the provided documents, we can conclude that statement D: 'They have a lower proportional limit than gold alloys' is true for cast cobalt alloys.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
