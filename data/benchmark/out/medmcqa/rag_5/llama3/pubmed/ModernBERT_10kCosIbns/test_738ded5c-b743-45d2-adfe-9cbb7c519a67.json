["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for a short-acting non-depolarizing muscle relaxant. From the given documents, we can see that rocuronium has an equilibrium dissociation constant of 0.71 +/- 0.09 microM, which represents concentration of relaxant for 50% inhibition of response. This indicates that rocurium is a short-acting non-depolarizing muscle relaxant.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
