["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about managing a 72-year-old gentleman with new onset focal seizures. The relevant documents provided are studies on epilepsy, seizure frequency, and therapy courses. Since the patient has normal renal functions, we can focus on pharmacological management. Among the options, sodium valproate is not specifically mentioned as a treatment for focal seizures in any of the provided documents. Oxcarbazepine is an option for treating partial seizures with or without secondary generalization (study: Natural history of recurrent seizures after resective surgery for epilepsy). Leviteracetam is also an option for treating partial-onset seizures (study: Surgery for focal epilepsy in the older patient). Pregabalin is not mentioned as a treatment for focal seizures in the provided documents. Therefore, based on the information available, Oxcarbazepine and Leviteracetam are both reasonable options.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
