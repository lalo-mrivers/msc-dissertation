["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents do not specifically mention POCSO (Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act) or its definitions. However, based on the context and information provided, it can be inferred that aggravated sexual offence is a more severe form of sexual offense. The options provided are all forms of rape or sexual offenses that may be considered more serious due to factors such as multiple perpetrators, threat of harm, or societal unrest.\n\nUpon analyzing the available data, we see that most victims were female and under 18 years old, with the majority being below 14 years old. This suggests that aggravated sexual offense might involve victims who are minors.\n\nConsidering this information, it is likely that 'Rape by police officer' (option C) would not be considered an aggravated sexual offence as it involves a person in a position of authority and power.\n\nGang Rape (option A), Rape by threatening (option B), and Rape during communal violence (option D) are all forms of rape that could be considered more severe due to the involvement of multiple perpetrators, threat of harm, or societal unrest. Therefore, these options might be considered aggravated sexual offences according to POCSO.\n\nBased on this analysis, option C: Rape by police officer is likely to be an exception.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
