["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question states that a material turns to liquid on applying critical shear stress. Based on the provided documents, we can see that red blood cells adhering to a glass surface deform and elongate when acted on by a fluid shear stress. Crenated cells become smooth when the shear stress exceeds 6 dynes/cm2. The cell membrane forms thin tethers, and cell detachment from the surface occurs when the shear stress exceeds 10 dynes/cm2. This suggests that applying critical shear stress can cause the material to change its state from solid to liquid.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: Pseudoplastic\""]
