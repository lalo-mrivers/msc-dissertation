["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The provided documents are related to congenital cataract, but none of them mention the specific gene commonly indicated in congenital cataract. However, we can analyze each option: A) PAX-6 is a transcription factor involved in eye development and has been linked to congenital cataracts; B) CRYGS-3 is not a known gene associated with congenital cataract; C) LMX-IB is a gene expressed in the developing eye, but its association with congenital cataract is unclear; D) PITX-3 is a transcription factor involved in eye development and has been linked to congenital cataracts. Given this analysis, we can infer that either A or D is the most likely answer.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
