["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks why glucose-6-phosphate, freshly synthesized during glycogenesis in the cytoplasm of hepatocytes, is not immediately degraded by glucose-6-phosphatase. From the given documents, we know that glucose-6-phosphatase is an enzyme present on the surface of liver microsomes (membranes). Inactivation of this enzyme has been measured in vitro and correlates with the known degradation rate constants of enzymes in the intact liver. Moreover, proteolytic digestion by trypsin or bacterial proteases limited to the cytosolic side of the native microsomal membrane is not efficient to inhibit glucose-6-phosphate hydrolysis. This suggests that the enzyme is not accessible from the cytoplasmic surface. Therefore, it is unlikely for glucose-6-phosphatase to immediately degrade glucose-6-phosphate freshly synthesized during glycogenesis in the cytoplasm of hepatocytes.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
