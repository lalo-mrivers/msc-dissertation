["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the pulp horns that are likely to be exposed while preparing a Class II cavity on a maxillary first molar. The relevant document 'Root canal morphology of the maxillary first premolar' states that 69% of maxillary first premolars have two canals, and these canals occur equally in all types of canals, mainly in the apical region, and exit from the main canal mostly in a palatal direction. This suggests that one or both of the mesiolingual and distolingual pulp horns are likely to be exposed during cavity preparation.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: Distolingual and mesiobuccal\""]
