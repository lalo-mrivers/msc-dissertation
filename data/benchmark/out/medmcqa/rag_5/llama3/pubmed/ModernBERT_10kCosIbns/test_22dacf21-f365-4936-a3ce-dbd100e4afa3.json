["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about features seen in myasthenia gravis. The documents provide information about the disease. From [Myasthenia gravis], we know that patients with MG have muscular weakness relieved by rest, and anticholinesterase drugs are primary therapeutics. This suggests that muscle fatigability (B) is a feature of myasthenia gravis. From [Pathomechanisms of myasthenic crisis states], we see that the clinical picture of myasthenia includes three main kinds of crisis, which may involve respiratory failure and muscle weakness. Again, this points to muscle fatigability (B). The documents also mention the importance of thymectomy, plasmapheresis, and immunosuppressant drugs in treating MG, suggesting that thymus pathology is relevant. From [The heart in myasthenia gravis], we see that electrocardiographic abnormalities were detected in 3 patients (16.6%). This suggests that ptosis (A) is also a feature of myasthenia gravis. From [Myasthenia gravis in the frontier of psychiatric diagnosis], we know that depression scores are related to dosage of anticholinesteratic medication, and self-reported muscular weakness. This points to muscle fatigability (B). Finally, absent DTRs (C) is a well-known feature of myasthenia gravis. From [Micrognathia in myasthenia gravis case report], we see that patients with MG may undergo aesthetic, functional operation, which leads to improvement in the course of the disease. This does not directly relate to the question, but it suggests that normal pupillary reflex (D) is a feature of myasthenia gravis.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
