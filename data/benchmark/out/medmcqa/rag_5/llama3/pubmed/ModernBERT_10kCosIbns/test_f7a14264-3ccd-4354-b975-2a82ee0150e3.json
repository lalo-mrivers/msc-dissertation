["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the major pattern of accessory canals in mandibular molars. We are given four options: A, B, C, and D. We need to analyze the provided documents related to root canal morphology of mandibular premolars and furcation anatomy of first mandibular molar in dogs. From these documents, we can infer that mandibular premolars have a simpler root canal system compared to molars. The documents do not specifically mention accessory canals in mandibular molars. However, we can use our knowledge of general dental anatomy and the provided information about furcation anatomy to make an educated guess.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
