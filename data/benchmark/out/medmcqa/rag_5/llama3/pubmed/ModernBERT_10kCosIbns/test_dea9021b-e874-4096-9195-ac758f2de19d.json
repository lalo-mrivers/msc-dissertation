["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has suddenly removed the endotracheal tube. As per the documents, accidental intubation of the oesophagus is a rare complication that can have fatal outcome. Since the patient has removed the tube, it's possible that the tube was in the esophagus rather than the trachea. Therefore, the first step would be to assess the patient and look for signs of correct tube placement. A typical CO2 excretion waveform is one of the best practical signs.

In this case, the next step would be to provide bag and mask ventilation and look for signs of correct tube placement.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
