["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant document for this question is the study on 'The incidence of mandibular premolars with more than one root canal in a Turkish population'. According to this study, it was found that the incidence of finding two or three separate canals in the same root was 9.62%. As we are looking for the percentage of Mandibular incisors, not premolars, we need to find another relevant document. After reviewing the other documents, I couldn't find any information on the frequency of two root canals in Mandibular incisors. Therefore, I will base my answer solely on the provided data and make an assumption that the frequency is similar for both premolars and incisors.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
