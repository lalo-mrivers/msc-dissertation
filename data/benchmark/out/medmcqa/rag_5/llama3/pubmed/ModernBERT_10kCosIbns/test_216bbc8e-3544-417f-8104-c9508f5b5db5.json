["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking which part of the 2nd metatarsal is involved in the March fracture. The relevant documents mention 'slow' fractures of the metatarsi, including those involving the metatarsal basis. This suggests that the fracture may be occurring at the base or shaft of the bone.
