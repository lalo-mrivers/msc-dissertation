["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about an adolescent male patient with excessive glycogen present on biopsy. Since the patient has high levels of glycogen after exercise, it suggests that there might be an enzyme deficiency affecting glycogen breakdown. The options provided are enzymes involved in glycogen metabolism. Muscle debranching enzyme (A) and phosphorylase enzyme (D) are both involved in glycogen degradation. Phosphofructokinase I (B) is an enzyme involved in glycolysis, which would not directly affect glycogen levels. Glucose 6-phosphatase (C) is an enzyme involved in gluconeogenesis, which is the process of generating glucose from non-carbohydrate sources. Considering that the patient has excessive glycogen present, it is more likely that the deficiency affects glycogen degradation rather than synthesis or gluconeogenesis.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
