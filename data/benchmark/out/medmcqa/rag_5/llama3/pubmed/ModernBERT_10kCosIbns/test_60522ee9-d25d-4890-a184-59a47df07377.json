["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The Human Poverty Index (HPI) is a measure of deprivation in dimensions such as health, education, and living standards. It does not include factors that are not directly related to these dimensions. Percentage of population not surviving up to 40 years age, Occupation, and percentage of population not using safe water supply do not seem to be directly related to the HPI. Underweight for age is a measure of nutritional status which could be related to health dimension of the HPI. However, considering the context of poverty and nutrition, it seems more likely that the correct answer is related to one of the other options.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
