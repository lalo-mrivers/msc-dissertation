["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents provide information on impression materials, their properties, and methods for measuring their elastic recovery. However, none of the documents specifically mention washing an elastic impression with a slurry of water and stone before pouring. Therefore, we need to rely on general knowledge about impression materials. Syneresis is a common phenomenon in impression materials where they release excess liquid. Washing the impression with a slurry of water and stone may help prevent this from happening. This would maintain the dimensional stability of the impression material.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
