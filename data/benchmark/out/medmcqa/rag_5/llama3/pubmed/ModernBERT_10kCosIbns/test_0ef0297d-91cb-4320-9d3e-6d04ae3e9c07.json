["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, we can analyze the mechanisms of protein synthesis in eukaryotes. According to [Mechanism and regulation of eukaryotic protein synthesis], the process involves numerous factors, including initiation, elongation, and termination. The review highlights the role of ribosomes and peptidyl transferase in these stages. RNA polymerase is not directly mentioned as a factor in protein synthesis in this context. Amino acyl tRNA synthetase is also not explicitly mentioned as required for eukaryotic protein synthesis. Therefore, considering the information provided, we can conclude that RNA polymerase is not required for protein synthesis of eukaryotes.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
