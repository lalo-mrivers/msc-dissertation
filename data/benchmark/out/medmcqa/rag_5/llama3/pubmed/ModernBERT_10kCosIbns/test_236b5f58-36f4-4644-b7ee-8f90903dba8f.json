["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"After reviewing the relevant documents, I looked for information on domestic violence against children. In 'The prevalence and context of family violence against children in Finland', it is mentioned that mild violence (slapping, pushing, etc.) was reported by 72% of the respondents, while severe violence (hitting with a fist, kicking, use of weapons) was reported by 8%. Mild and severe violence were both perpetrated more frequently by fathers than mothers. Girls reported mild abuse more often than boys. Severe violence was experienced equally often by both sexes.\n\nIn 'Recognizing and reporting victims of domestic violence', it is stated that the dentist might be the first to treat a domestic violence victim, as most intentional injuries occur in the head and neck area. This suggests that signs of physical trauma may be present.\n\nLooking at the options provided for this question, I notice that A (Wormian bones) does not seem relevant to physical trauma or signs of abuse, whereas B (Microfractures in the sub-ep physeal region), C (Corner fractures), and D (Bucket handle fractures of metaphyses) all relate to possible signs of physical abuse. Therefore, I conclude that Wormian bones are the most likely option for 'All of the following are suggestive of domestic violence in a child except...'\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
