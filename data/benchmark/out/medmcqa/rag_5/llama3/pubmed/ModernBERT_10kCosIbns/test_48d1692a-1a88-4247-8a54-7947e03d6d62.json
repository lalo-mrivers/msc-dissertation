["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"There is no relevant information about optimal anti-rotational design or offset values in the provided documents. The documents discuss sterilization methods for diamond instruments, cutting effectiveness of diamond instruments, marginal accuracy and geometry of cast titanium copings, dental instrument sterilization by glass bead conduction of heat, and magnetically abrasive finishing for sharpening medical instruments' blades. None of these topics relate to anti-rotational design or offset values. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the optimal anti-rotational design in a blade based on the provided information.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"None of the above\""]
