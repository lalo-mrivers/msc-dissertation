["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for the most effective caries prevention program in children. The provided documents describe various caries prevention programs, but none of them specifically compare different methods and state which one is the most effective. However, we can infer some information from the studies. For example, the study on intensified caries prevention found that there was no significant difference between two risk groups despite more preventive procedures being provided for the high-risk group. This suggests that a program targeting high-risk individuals may not be effective in reducing caries incidence. The study on WHO's oral health program for preschool children found that 50% of six-year-old children had dentures free of caries after three years of prevention, indicating that a comprehensive program can be effective. However, the most relevant information comes from the background factors affecting dental caries study, which found that different factors explain caries experience in Finnish and Soviet children, suggesting that one-size-fits-all approach may not work. Based on this analysis, oral health education seems to be a key component of an effective caries prevention program.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
