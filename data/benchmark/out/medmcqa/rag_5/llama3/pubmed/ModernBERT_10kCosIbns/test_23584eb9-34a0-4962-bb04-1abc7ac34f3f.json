["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about a new drug combination of chemotherapy and immunotherapy for metastatic melanoma that prolongs survival. We can infer that the treatment is effective in preventing early recurrence, as mentioned in the paper 'Randomized trial of adjuvant therapy for \"high risk\" primary malignant melanoma'. This suggests that the incidence of recurrence decreases with the treatment. The prevalence of melanoma may also decrease if the treatment prevents early recurrence and prolongs survival. Therefore, it can be concluded that the incidence reduces and prevalence increases.\", \"answer_choice\": C}"]
