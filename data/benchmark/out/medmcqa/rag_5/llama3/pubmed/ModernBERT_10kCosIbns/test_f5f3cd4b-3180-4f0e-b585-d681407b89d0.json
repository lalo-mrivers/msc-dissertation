["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, we know that the mean intraocular pressure is 25 mmHg with a standard deviation of 10 mmHg. We want to find the range within which 95% of the population would be lying. To do this, we can use the Z-score formula and calculate the values for the upper and lower limits of the 95th percentile (2*SD from the mean). This will give us the range in which 95% of the population would be lying.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B: 20-30 mm Hg\"\n}"]
