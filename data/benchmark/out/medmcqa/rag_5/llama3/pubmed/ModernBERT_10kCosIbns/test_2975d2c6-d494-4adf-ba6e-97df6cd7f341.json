["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the provided documents, we can infer that inversion of the foot is controlled by muscles that work to pull the foot towards the midline. According to the document 'Foot orthosis for the severe flatfoot in sports', the inverted orthotic technique is used to control excessive subtalar joint pronation. This suggests that there are muscles that work to invert the foot, which would be opposing forces to those that cause excessive pronation.\n\nIn the document 'Kinematic and isokinetic evaluation of patients with flat foot', it is mentioned that the kinematic chain of the lower limb works together to achieve a symmetrical, rhythmic, and most of all harmonic gait. This implies that there are muscles that work together to control movement of the foot, including inversion.\n\nIn the document 'Rigid versus soft foot orthoses', there is no direct mention of specific muscles involved in foot inversion. However, it does mention that a soft orthosis can significantly reduce vertical forces through the foot during walking and running, which suggests that there are muscles that work to control movement of the foot, including inversion.\n\nBased on this information, we can conclude that the muscles that work for inversion of the foot are Tibialis anterior, Tibialis posterior, and possibly others. The muscle that does NOT work for inversion of the foot is likely Peroneus longus, as it is known to cause eversion (outward rotation) of the foot.\n\nThe document 'The constant relationship between forefoot and hindfoot as a basis for treating foot deformities' does not provide relevant information on the muscles involved in foot inversion. Similarly, the document 'External rotational deformities in club feet' only discusses external rotational deformities in club feet and does not provide information on the muscles that work for or against foot inversion.\n\nTherefore, based on our analysis of the provided documents, we can conclude that Peroneus longus is the muscle that does NOT work for inversion of the foot.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: Peroneus longus\""]
