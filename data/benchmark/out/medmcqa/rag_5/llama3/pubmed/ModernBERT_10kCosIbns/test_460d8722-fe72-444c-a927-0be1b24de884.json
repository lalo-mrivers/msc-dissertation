["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the nerve supply of the adrenal gland. The relevant documents describe the blood supply and nerve innervation of the adrenal medulla and cortex in different species, including cats, pigs, and humans. From these studies, we can infer that the adrenal medulla has a dual innervation pattern, with both cholinergic and adrenergic fibers present. This is confirmed by the study on cat adrenal medulla, which used multiple techniques to demonstrate the presence of adrenergic fibers and terminals in the adrenal medulla. The same study also suggests that norepinephrine cells have a dual innervation pattern, with both cholinergic and adrenergic fibers present. This is not unique for the autonomic nervous system but has functional and pharmacologic significance.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
