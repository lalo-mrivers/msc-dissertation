["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, I will analyze each option to determine if it is an adverse effect of Foscarnet. Option A, Hypercalcemia, is ruled out as there is no mention of this in any of the documents. Options B and D, Hyperkalemia and Hypokalemia, are also not mentioned in the documents, so they can be eliminated. Option C, Hypocalcemia, is a documented adverse effect of Foscarnet infusion in dogs (Hypocalcemia induced by foscarnet (Foscavir) infusion in dogs.) and in humans (Foscarnet-induced hypocalcemia and effects of foscarnet on calcium metabolism.). Therefore, Hypocalcemia is the correct answer.\", \"answer_choice\": C}"]
