["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, we can identify that coagulase-negative staphylococci are involved in the question. The document '[Pseudocoagulase activity of staphylococci]' explains that proteolytic enzymes of staphylococci interfere with staphylocoagulase-induced clotting and may simulate coagulase-positive activity of staphylococci. This suggests that coagulase is the enzyme required to induce the formation of a plasma clot in pathogenic staphylococci.\", \"answer_choice\": C}"]
