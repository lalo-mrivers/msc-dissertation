["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the drug of choice for Burkholderia cepacia pneumonia. Burkholderia cepacia is a type of Pseudomonas cepacia. The relevant documents provide information on the characteristics and properties of Pseudomonas cepacia. Since there are no specific studies or recommendations provided in the documents regarding Burkholderia cepacia pneumonia, we will consider the general information about Pseudomonas cepacia. Pseudomonas cepacia is known to be resistant to many antibiotics, including aminoglycosides and polymyxin B sulfate. Therefore, a combination of aminoglycoside and colistin may not be an effective choice. The documents also suggest that imipenem and piperacillin have significant post-antibiotic effects against Pseudomonas cepacia, making them potential choices. However, there is no specific information on the use of these antibiotics for pneumonia caused by Pseudomonas cepacia.\n\nBased on this analysis, we can consider the general characteristics of Pseudomonas cepacia and its antibiotic resistance patterns. This suggests that a combination of antibiotics with synergistic effects may be more effective than a single drug.\",\n\"answer_choice\": A"]
