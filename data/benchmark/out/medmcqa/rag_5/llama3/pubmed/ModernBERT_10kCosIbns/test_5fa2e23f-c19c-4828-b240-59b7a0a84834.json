["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents discuss neonatal body temperature, heat loss, and thermoregulation. The first document reports on a study that found most infants had temperatures < 36°C at 2h and 24h after delivery, with the majority of cold infants becoming cold at the time of delivery. The second document discusses heat loss in Nigerian newborn infants, showing that infants exposed to room air lost twice as much heat compared to those insulated with two towels. The third document highlights temperature instability during nursing procedures in preterm neonates, while the fourth document emphasizes the importance of thermoregulation and stabilization of body temperature at a 'neutral temperature zone'. From these documents, it can be inferred that maintaining a warm environment is crucial for newborns.\n\nThe only reference to an ideal temperature in the delivery room is found in the last document, which reports on the effect of early parent-infant contact on newborn body temperature. Although the exact ideal temperature is not specified, the study suggests that properly dried and wrapped infants can be held by parents without suffering a significant heat loss, implying that the ambient temperature should be suitable for this.\n\nIn light of these findings, it appears reasonable to assume that the ideal temperature in the delivery room for keeping neonates warm would fall within the 30-35°C range, as this is consistent with the thermoregulation and stabilization requirements mentioned in the last document.\",\n\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
