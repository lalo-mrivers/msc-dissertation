["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents suggest that saliva plays a role in caries susceptibility and resistance. Salivary diagnostics is useful for estimating the caries activity due to bad dietary habits (salivary lactobacilli), establishing the presence of infection (salivary mutans streptococci), and identification of salivary yeasts. Buffer capacity reveals the most important host response factor acting against caries, while measures of flow rate form the diagnostic basis for treatment planning. In a study on dietary and salivary factors associated with root caries, subjects with root caries had significantly higher lactobacilli counts and less salivary buffering capacity.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
