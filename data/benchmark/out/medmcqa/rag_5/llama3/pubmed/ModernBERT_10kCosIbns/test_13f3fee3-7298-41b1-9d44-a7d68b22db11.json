["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about submandibular calculus removal. The provided documents don't explicitly discuss this topic. However, one document discusses the anatomy of the submandibular triangle and mentions that the submandibular gland contains five nerves. This suggests that the gland may be involved in the process of removing a submandibular calculus. Another document discusses roentgencinematography studies on the mechanics of the temporomandibular joint, which seems unrelated to the removal of submandibular calculi. The last two documents discuss the surgical anatomy of the submandibular triangle and complications of temporo-mandibular arthroscopy, neither of which provides direct information about removing a submandibular calculus. Based on this analysis, it appears that the document [Examination technique in ultrasound calculus detection in the submandibular gland] is the most relevant to the question. It discusses examination techniques for detecting submandibular calculi using ultrasound and orthopantomography. This suggests that removal of a submandibular calculus may be possible using similar techniques or possibly surgical methods.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
