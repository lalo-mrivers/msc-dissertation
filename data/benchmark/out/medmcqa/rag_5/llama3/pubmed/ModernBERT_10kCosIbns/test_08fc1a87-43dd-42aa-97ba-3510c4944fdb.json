["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The document 'Macroscopic enzyme-mapping verification of large, homogeneous, experimental myocardial infarcts of predictable size and location in dogs.' describes a technique for verifying the homogeneity of an infarct.

This indicates that the dehydrogenase deficient area will not turn blue.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C: Blue\"\n}"]
