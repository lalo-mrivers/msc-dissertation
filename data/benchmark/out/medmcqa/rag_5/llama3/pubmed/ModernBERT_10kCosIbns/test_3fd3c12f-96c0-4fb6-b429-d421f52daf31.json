["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about Robinson's classification of ameloblastoma. The relevant documents provided are related to different types of ameloblastomas such as mural, peripheral, and ossifying ameloblastomas. None of the documents mention Robinson's classification or its categories. Therefore, we need to look for reliable sources that provide information on Robinson's classification.
