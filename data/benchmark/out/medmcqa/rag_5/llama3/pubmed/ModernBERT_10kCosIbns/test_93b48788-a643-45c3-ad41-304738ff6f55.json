["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for the best indicator of developing cardiovascular disease. From the provided documents, we can see that high blood pressure (BP) and elevated blood cholesterol level are major risk factors for cardiovascular disease. The Canadian Heart Health Surveys Research Group found that prevalence of high BP and elevated blood cholesterol increased with BMI and waist-to-hip ratio. Similarly, the Cardiovascular Health Study found that hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and glucose intolerance were common CVD risk factors in older adults.\n\nHowever, none of these documents specifically mention LDL cholesterol level more than 120 mg/dl as a risk factor for developing cardiovascular disease. LDL/HDL ratio is also not mentioned as a standalone indicator of CVD risk. Salt intake has been linked to blood pressure and cardiovascular disease risk, but it is not the best indicator of developing cardiovascular disease.\n\nTherefore, the answer choice that seems most relevant to the question is C: LDL/HDL ratio, which is often used in combination with other risk factors to assess cardiovascular disease risk. However, this is not explicitly stated in any of the provided documents as the 'best' indicator of developing cardiovascular disease.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"]
