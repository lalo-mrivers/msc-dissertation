["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has developed cardiac arrhythmias after a course of antibiotics while taking terfenadine. Terfenadine is a second-generation H1 antihistamine with little or no anticholinergic activity, which suggests that the antibiotic given may not be related to antihistamines. The patient's allergic rhinitis is seasonal and treated with terfenadine. Cardiac arrhythmias are an adverse effect of certain antibiotics, such as macrolides (Erythromycin). There is no mention of penicillin or cephalosporins in the provided documents, which suggests that Ampicillin and Co-trimoxazole can be ruled out. Tetracycline is a broad-spectrum antibiotic that may cause cardiac arrhythmias, but it is not as likely to cause anaphylaxis as macrolides. Therefore, the most plausible choice would be Erythromycin.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
