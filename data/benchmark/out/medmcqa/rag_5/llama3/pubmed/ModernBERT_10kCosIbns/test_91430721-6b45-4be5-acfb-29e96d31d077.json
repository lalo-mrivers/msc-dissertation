["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the type of flow that occurs when a material turns to liquid on applying critical shear stress. From the provided documents, we can see that red blood cells adhering to a glass surface deform and elongate when acted on by fluid shear stress. When the shear stress exceeds 6 dynes/cm2, crenated cells become smooth. This suggests that the material exhibits non-Newtonian behavior. The document 'Rheology of pharmaceutical systems: oscillatory and steady shear of non-Newtonian viscoelastic liquids' also discusses the rheological properties of carboxymethylcellulose solutions under both oscillatory and steady shear methods, indicating that the material is non-Newtonian.\n\nConsidering these points, we can conclude that the material exhibits pseudoplastic behavior, as it becomes more fluid when subjected to increasing shear stress.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
