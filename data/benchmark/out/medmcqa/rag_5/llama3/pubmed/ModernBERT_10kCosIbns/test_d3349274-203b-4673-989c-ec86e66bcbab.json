["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the motor supply of infrahyoid muscle. We can look at relevant documents to find the answer. The document [Biometric aspects of hyoid mechanics in man] explains the movements of the human hyoïd bone, and it appears that the hyoïd mechanic, which is at best expressed during swallowing and speech articulation, is mainly dependent on styloid suspension, that allows sinusoïdal trajectories.\\n\\nAccording to the document Problem neck, hyoid bone, and submental myotomy, from an analysis of cephaloxerograms on 54 patients, it was concluded that on a balanced neck, the most caudal border of the hyoid body is located at or above a line parallel to the Frankfort horizontal line passing through the most caudal border of the mandibular symphysis (menton).\\n\\nThe document Comparative anatomical study of the hyoid apparatus in selected primates explains the anatomy and role of the hyoid bone and suprahyoid muscles in cervicomental morphology.\\n\\nThere is no direct information about the motor supply of infrahyoid muscle in these documents, but we can infer that it might be related to the stylohyoid muscles, which pull this bone cephalad and posteriorly.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
