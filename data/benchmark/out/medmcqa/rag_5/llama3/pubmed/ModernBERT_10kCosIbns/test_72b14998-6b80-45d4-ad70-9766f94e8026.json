["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the way iron enters enterocytes. The provided documents discuss ferritin, intestinal iron absorption, and iron metabolism. Ferritin is a protein that stores iron, but it's also a carrier of iron in rapid equilibrium with chelated iron. This suggests that iron may be transported as a chelate with which ferritin is in rapid equilibrium. There is no mention of divalent cation transporters, ferropoin, hephaestin, or ceruloplasmin.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
