["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the treatment of ameloblastoma. After reviewing the relevant documents, I noticed that one of the documents discusses a case of peripheral ameloblastoma, which exhibits less aggressive and destructive behavior than endo-osseous ameloblastoma and does not invade the underlying bone. This suggests that conservative treatment might be suitable for certain types of ameloblastomas.
