["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the differences between primary and secondary teeth roots. Deciduous teeth contain histories of developmental disturbances which can be studied histologically to demonstrate evidence of metabolic disturbances occurring during tooth development. The crowns of the deciduous teeth are permanent structures which form by incremental growth during the second half of pregnancy and first year of life. These structures become available between the ages of 6 and 12 years with normal exfoliation. This information does not relate to the roots of primary and secondary teeth. The relevant document is the study about vascular pathways within pulpal tissue of human primary teeth.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: None of the above\"\n}"]
