["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The description of the problem suggests that the patient's denture is falling when they open their mouth wide. This could be due to a poor peripheral seal or over-extended borders. Additionally, the fact that the denture falls in conjunction with the opening of the mouth wide implies that the issue may be related to the posterior occlusal plane being lowered as described in 'Complete removable dentures and prognathism'. This suggests that the problem is not related to a thick labial flange or disto-buccal flange, as these would affect the anterior and lateral aspects of the denture, respectively.\", \"answer_choice\": C}"]
