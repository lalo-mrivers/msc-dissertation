["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about structures lying deep to the hyoglossus muscle. The relevant documents mention the hypoglossal canal, where the hypoglossal nerve runs, and the hypoglossal artery. These two structures are mentioned as being related to the tongue. However, neither the hypoglossal nerve nor the hypoglossal artery lies deep to the hyoglossus muscle. The lingual artery is not directly related to the location asked about. The stylohyoid and geniohyoid muscles are muscles that lie near the tongue but are not structures lying deep to it.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
