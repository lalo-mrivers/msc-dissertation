["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, I can see that Pseudomonas is resistant to many antibiotics. The document 'Susceptibilities of Pseudomonas species to tetracycline, minocycline, gentamicin, and tobramycin' shows that minocycline has uniform susceptibility with Pseudomonas isolates. However, the same document also states that strains of Pseudomonas that were uniformly susceptible to antibiotics in vitro were not uniformly susceptible in vivo.\n\nThe other documents show that some antibiotics are effective against Pseudomonas, such as polymyxin B and tobramycin. However, there is no information provided about Lincomycin or Oxacillin being effective against Pseudomonas.\n\nAs for Indole +ve Proteus, it's mentioned in the document 'Susceptibilities of Pseudomonas species to tetracycline, minocycline, gentamicin, and tobramycin' that some strains of Pseudomonas were susceptible to all four antibiotics tested, including polymyxin B. However, there is no specific information about Indole +ve Proteus.\n\nBased on this analysis, I would choose the antibiotic that has shown effectiveness against both Pseudomonas and Indole +ve Proteus. This would be Tobramycin.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
