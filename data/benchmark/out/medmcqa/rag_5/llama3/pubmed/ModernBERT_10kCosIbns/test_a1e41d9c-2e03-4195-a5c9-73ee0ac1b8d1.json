["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the development of a tooth. According to the provided documents, tooth germs from newborn infants were examined by scanning electron microscopy and light microscopy. The document 'Surface structure of tooth germs from newborn infants: a light and scanning electron microscopical study' states that the enamel organ forms a swelling and extends from the dental lamina to the tip of the tongue-like projection of the enamel organ, forming there a swelling. This suggests that the development of the tooth originates from the ectoderm layer.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B: Ectoderm\"\n}"]
