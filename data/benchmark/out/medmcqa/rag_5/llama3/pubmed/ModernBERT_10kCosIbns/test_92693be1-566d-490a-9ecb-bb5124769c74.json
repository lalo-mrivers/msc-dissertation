["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The provided documents describe the findings of several studies on dental caries. One study compared radiographic and directly assessed clinical caries status of posterior approximal surfaces in primary and permanent teeth. It did not specifically mention the 2nd molar tooth. Another study described the caries increment of proximal surfaces over a six-year period, but it also did not provide information about the primary 2nd molar tooth. The other studies discussed various aspects of dental caries, such as its occurrence in different populations and the progression of caries lesions. However, none of these studies specifically addressed the question of where caries occur most commonly on a primary 2nd molar tooth. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the answer based on the provided information.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
