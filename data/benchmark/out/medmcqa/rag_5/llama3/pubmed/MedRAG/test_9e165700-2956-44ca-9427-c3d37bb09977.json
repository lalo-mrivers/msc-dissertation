["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Since we're discussing mandibular molars with multiple canals, I'll look for relevant information from the provided documents. The first document talks about C-shaped canal configurations in mandibular molars, which is an interesting finding associated with Type IV canal systems. This leads me to the second document, which discusses endodontic therapy in a mandibular second bicuspid with four canals. This shows that multiple canals are possible in mandibular molars. The third and fourth documents provide more information about root canal morphology and variations, including C-shaped canals in mandibular second molars. There is no specific mention of access cavity shape or mandibular 1st molar with four canals, but we do know that variations in root canal morphology and the number of canals might not have been detected even during close inspection of the pulp chamber floor. Therefore, I'll rely on general knowledge of root canal morphology to answer this question.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
