["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents provided are related to the characterization of ceramic-base-metal alloys, development of an abrasion testing machine for dental materials, influence of carbon content on mechanical properties in a cast dental Co-Cr alloy, and experimental comparative study on investment materials for casting high-melting dental alloys. However, none of these documents specifically mention measuring hardness of Co-Cr alloy. Therefore, we need to look for information about hardness measurement in the provided documents. One document that mentions hardness is 'The influence of carbon content on the mechanical properties in a cast dental Co-Cr alloy'. This document states that hardness was determined for test-pieces with varying carbon content. It does not specify which hardness test was used, but it does mention the results showing that hardness increased with increased carbon content.\", \"answer_choice\": D}"]
