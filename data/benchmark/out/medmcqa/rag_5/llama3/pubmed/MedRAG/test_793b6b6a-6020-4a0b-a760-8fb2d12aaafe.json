["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the provided documents, we can see that supragingival plaque control was mentioned in two studies. In 'The effect of supragingival plaque control on the subgingival microbiota in subjects with periodontal disease', it is stated that oral hygiene instruction and supragingival scaling were performed to improve self-performed plaque control, resulting in a supragingival plaque score < 20%. This suggests that supragingival plaque mass decreases as a result of proper control. Additionally, in 'The effect of supragingival plaque control on the subgingival microbiota in subjects with periodontal disease', it is mentioned that carefully performed supragingival plaque control changed the quantity and composition of the supragingival microbiota, implying that the microflora becomes less dense or more homogeneous. Therefore, based on these findings, we can conclude that supragingival plaque undergoes a decrease in mass with time.\",\n\"answer_choice\": A"]
