["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the sulcular epithelium acting as a semi-permeable membrane. In one of the provided documents, 'The permeability of oral mucosa', it mentions that the oral mucosa is not uniformly permeable, but shows regional variation. The sulcus is part of the oral mucosa, and based on this information, we can infer that the sulcular epithelium also has varying levels of permeability.
