The reports also highlight the importance of considering gender-related factors in pharmacotherapeutic research. In the context of infertility management, recent methods for induction of ovulation in women were described. The only indication for use of these medications is induction of ovulation and pregnancy.\n\nConsidering the options provided, Clomiphene is a well-established medication used to induce ovulation in patients with anovulatory infertility. Tamoxifen is an anti-estrogen drug that has been used off-label for some indications, but it's not typically used as a first-line treatment for inducing ovulation.\n\nOCPs (Oral Contraceptive Pills) are primarily used for contraception and hormone replacement therapy, not for inducing ovulation. Metformin is often used to treat polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOD), which may present with infertility.\n\nGiven these points, the most likely answer would be a drug that is not typically used in PCOD patients with infertility.
