["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to the document [The relationship of the mechanical properties of the dentoalveolar complex to the status of the bone tissue in traumatic occlusion], experiments with dogs have demonstrated a progressive reduction of the ability of dental abutment tissues to resist load and slowed down reparative processes in the periodontal tissues in swinging type traumatic occlusion. This suggests that alveolar bone resorption occurs in response to traumatic occlusal forces.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
