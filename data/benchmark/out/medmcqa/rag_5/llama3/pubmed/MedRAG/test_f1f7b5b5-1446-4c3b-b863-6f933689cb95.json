["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, we can see that hyperplastic callus formation is described as a parallelism with hyperplastic scars and heterotopic ossifications. We also learn that subjects prone to hyperplastic scars are more likely to form rapid and exuberant callus or heterotopic ossification than normal subjects. Moreover, in the context of osteogenesis imperfecta, we see that patients with hyperplastic callus formation have excessive deposition of extracellular matrix constituents, which is reminiscent of bone from early stages of human development and normal fracture healing. Therefore, it seems that factors contributing to callus formation might be related to collagen synthesis and posttranslational processing. Finally, considering the question asks about increasing callus formation, we can look at the provided options for potential answers.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
