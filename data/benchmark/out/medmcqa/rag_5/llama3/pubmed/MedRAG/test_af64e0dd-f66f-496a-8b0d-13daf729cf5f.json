["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe cases of optic neuropathy caused by vincristine therapy. In the first document, a patient developed symmetric optic neuropathy after treatment with nitrogen mustard, vincristine, procarbazine, and prednisone. Histopathologic sections showed loss of ganglion cells in the macular region and atrophy of the corresponding fibers in the optic nerve. Vincristine is presumed to have been the cause of the optic neuropathy due to its recognized neurotoxicity and temporal relation to the onset of the visual complaint. In the second document, two subjects with acute lymphatic leukemia developed unilateral optic neuropathy five to seven days following administration of vincristine during maintenance chemotherapy. Both subjects were in remission at the time their ocular problems developed. After discontinuance of vincristine therapy, marked vision improvement in the affected eye occurred over the ensuing months. It is presumed that vincristine therapy was the cause of toxic optic neuropathy in these patients.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
