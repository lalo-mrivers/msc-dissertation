["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the inhibition of metabolism by ritonavir. Ritonavir is a protease inhibitor that inhibits the maturation of HIV particles by blocking the viral proteinase. It does not inhibit the reverse transcriptase, which is blocked by ribavirin.\n\nThe text does not mention amiodarone, phenytoin, or midazolam as being affected by ritonavir's inhibition of metabolism. Therefore, it can be concluded that these drugs are not inhibited by ritonavir.\n\nCisapride is a substrate of CYP3A and is a known victim of ritonavir's inhibitory effects on its metabolism. This information is present in the relevant documents.\n\nThe answer to this question is based on the inhibition of metabolism by ritonavir, which is stated in the text as 'metabolism of all of the following drugs except...' The correct answer is C: Cisapride.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"]
