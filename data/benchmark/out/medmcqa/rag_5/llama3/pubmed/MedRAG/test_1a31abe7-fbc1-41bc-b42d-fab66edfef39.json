["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the provided documents, we can see that cholesterol is an important component of plasma lipoproteins. It's mentioned that plasma concentrations are controlled by complex mechanisms for secretion, transformation and removal of plasma lipoproteins. We also know that HDL, LDL and VLDL are types of plasma lipoproteins. Since the main focus is on plasma, we can rule out chylomicrons which are involved in biliary tract (gallstones) and tissue concentrations. Therefore, the most important carrier of cholesterol in plasma must be one of the three: HDL, LDL or VLDL.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
