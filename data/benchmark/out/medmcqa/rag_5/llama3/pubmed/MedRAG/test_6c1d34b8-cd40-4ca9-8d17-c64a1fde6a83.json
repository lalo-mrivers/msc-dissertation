["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"After reviewing the relevant documents, I noticed that none of the features mentioned (Myocardial abscess, Vegetation along cusps, Thrombus in left atria, Perforation of cusp) are explicitly stated as not being a feature of infective endocarditis. However, upon further examination, I found that thrombi or vegetations may be present on prosthetic heart valves (Prosthetic valve endocarditis: reviewing the problem.). This implies that vegetation along cusps and thrombus in left atria could be features of infective endocarditis. Perforation of a cusp is also mentioned as a complication of bacterial endocarditis (Streptoccocus faecalis endocarditis: an emerging problem?). Myocardial abscess, however, is not explicitly mentioned in any of the provided documents.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
