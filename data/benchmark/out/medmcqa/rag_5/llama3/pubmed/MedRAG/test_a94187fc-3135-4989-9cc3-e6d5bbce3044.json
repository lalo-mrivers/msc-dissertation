["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about follow-up care for a 5-year-old child with mandibular fracture. The documents provided are related to bone scans, mandibular fractures, and external fixators. Based on the document 'Mandibular fractures. II. A follow-up study of 229 patients', we can see that follow-up control is advised at 12 to 18 months after treatment. However, this document does not provide information about short-term follow-ups. The document 'The appearance of bone scans following fractures...' mentions a minimum time for a fracture to return to normal on a bone scan was 5 mo. Approximately 90% of the fractures returned to normal by 2 yr after injury. This suggests that bone healing may take longer than 2 months.\n\nLooking at the options, option D 'Clinical examination adequate' is not a relevant imaging modality for checking bone healing. Option C 'Single contrast CT' is not mentioned in any of the provided documents as an accepted method for follow-up care. Option B 'NCCT' could be considered, but it's not explicitly mentioned in any of the provided documents.\n\nBased on the available information, option A 'OPG at every 2 month till one year' seems to be a reasonable approach considering the age-dependent nature of bone healing and the fact that bone scans take some time to return to normal. This is because OPG (Orthopantomogram) is an imaging modality commonly used in dentistry and orthodontics, which might provide information about mandibular fracture healing.\",\n\"answer_choice\": A"]
