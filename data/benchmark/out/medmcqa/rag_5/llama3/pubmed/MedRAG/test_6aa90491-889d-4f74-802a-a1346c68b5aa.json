["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks for the lower limit of the average IOP that can be expected 95% of times. Since the distribution is normal (as indicated by the standard deviation), we can use the z-score to find the answer. The z-score corresponding to a 95% confidence interval is -1.96. We need to find the value where this z-score corresponds to the average IOP.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
