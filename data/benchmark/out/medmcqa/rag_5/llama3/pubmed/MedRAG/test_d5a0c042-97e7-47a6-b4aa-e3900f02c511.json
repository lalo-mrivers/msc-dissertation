["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents mention different forms of mercury, including elemental, organic, and chemical forms. The study 'The influence of final mercury content on the characteristics of a high-copper amalgam' discusses the properties of high-copper amalgams with varying Hg contents. It suggests that insufficient Cu is present at higher Hg contents to combine with Sn to form Cu6Sn5. This information does not directly relate to the question, but it highlights the importance of considering different mercury forms and their interactions in various contexts. The question asks about the least amount of mercury required, which might imply a scenario where mercury is being added or combined with other substances.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
