["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The LDL receptor is a cell surface transmembrane protein that mediates the uptake and lysosomal degradation of plasma LDL. It binds to low-density lipoproteins (LDL) and regulates the sterol content of cells by modulating the rates of uptake, esterification, and synthesis of cholesterol. The receptor-mediated endocytosis of LDL is a sequence of events in which receptor binding and internalization are coupled in specialized regions of the plasma membrane called coated pits.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
