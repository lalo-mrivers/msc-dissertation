["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The main arterial trunk supplying the infra-temporal fossa is described in 'Anastomosis of the anterior temporal artery to a secondary trunk of the middle cerebral artery for treatment of a giant M1 segment aneurysm. Case report.' This case report describes bypassing the involved MCA bifurcation, but the patient lacked a suitable donor superficial temporal artery. The involved arterial segment was therefore bypassed with a side-to-side anastomosis of the anterior temporal artery to one of the secondary trunks of the MCA. This bypass eliminated the need to harvest a vein graft and re-established flow using in situ intracranial vessels of similar diameter, minimal arterial dissection, and only one suture line. It can be inferred that the main arterial trunk supplying the infra-temporal fossa is the anterior temporal artery.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
