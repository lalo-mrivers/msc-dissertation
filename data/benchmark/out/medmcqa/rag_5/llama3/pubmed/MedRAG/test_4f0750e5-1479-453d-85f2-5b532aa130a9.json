["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The problem is asking about the volume fraction of filler in a dental composite. From the document 'Relationship between abrasive wear and microstructure of composite resins', we know that abrasion rates are dependent upon the size, hardness, and volume fraction of particles in the material. The most abrasion-resistant composites contain a high volume fraction of large, hard particles. Since 75% by weight filler is given, we need to find the corresponding volume fraction.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
