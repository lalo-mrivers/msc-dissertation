["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the hormone secreted by the female adrenal gland. From the provided documents, we can see that the adrenal cortex has three zones: glucocorticoid-producing zona fasciculata, mineralocorticoid-producing zona glomerulosa, and androgen-producing zona reticularis. Androgens are produced by both males and females. The document 'Adrenal steroid endocrinology--some unsolved problems' mentions that corticosteroids have suppressive effects on the release of ACTH, but it does not specify which hormone is secreted by the female adrenal gland. The document 'Primary adrenocortical insufficiency (Addison's disease)' talks about the deficiency of glucocorticoid, mineralocorticoid and androgen secretion in Addison's disease, but again does not specify which hormone is secreted by the female adrenal gland. The document 'Regulatory role of guanosine 3',5'-monophosphate in adrenocorticotropin hormone-induced steroidogenesis' discusses the mechanism of steroidogenesis induced by ACTH and mentions the production of steroid hormones, but it does not provide information about the specific hormone secreted by the female adrenal gland.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
