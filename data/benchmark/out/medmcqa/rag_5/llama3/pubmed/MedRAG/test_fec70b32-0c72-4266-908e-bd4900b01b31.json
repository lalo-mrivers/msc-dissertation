["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Aarskog syndrome is characterized by delayed development and eruption of the permanent teeth. Familial generalized delayed eruption of the dentition with short stature also displays similar features. Odontodysplasia can cause developmental anomalies, but it does not specifically mention large tongue or abnormal resorption pattern in primary teeth. Primary impaction of primary teeth is a rare condition that affects mostly second molars and has no relation to the described features.

Addison's disease does not have any characteristics that match the given features.\", \n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
