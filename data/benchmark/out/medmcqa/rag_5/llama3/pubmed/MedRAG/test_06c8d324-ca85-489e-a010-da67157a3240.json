["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents mention the effect of tetracycline on teeth discoloration. The first document mentions extrinsic discoloration associated with tetracycline use. The second document reports gray striated staining on all teeth after 2 years of minocycline use, which corresponds to treatment time. The third document studies dose-dependent ultrastructural changes in developing dental tissues of rats and notes that the changes increase with larger doses. The fourth document discusses the incidence of fluorescent tetracycline deposits in extracted first permanent molar teeth and finds a trend towards fewer children receiving courses of the antibiotic, associated with lower incidence and severity of crown discoloration. Based on these findings, it seems that higher dosages are more likely to cause tooth discoloration.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
