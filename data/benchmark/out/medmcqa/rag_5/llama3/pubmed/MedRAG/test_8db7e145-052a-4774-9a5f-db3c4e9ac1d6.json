["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The given information is about the length of humerus (24.5 cm). We need to find a relationship between the length of humerus and height. From the studies on stature in an early mid-19th century poorhouse population, we know that the best estimate of male stature (N = 84) is 172.6 cm, and the females showed a best height estimate of 160.0 cm. We can infer that there might be some relationship between the length of humerus and height. We don't have any information about symmetrical shortening of both humeri or osteoid-osteoma inducing pronounced overgrowth and deformity of bone. Therefore, we can focus on the normal relationships. A study on stature in an early mid-19th century poorhouse population: Highland Park, Rochester, New York shows that the length of humerus is not directly correlated to height. We cannot use this information for our calculation. The only way to proceed is by using some general information about average human proportions.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
