["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for the FEV1/FVC ratio from a patient's spirometry curve. The relevant documents provided discuss various spirometric measurements including forced vital capacity (FVC), one-second forced expiratory volume (FEV1) and the ratio of one-second forced expiratory flow to FVC. The document on 'Normal values and evaluation of forced end-expiratory flow' explains how to calculate the FEV1/FVC ratio. According to this document, the FEV1/FVC ratio is a useful test in evaluating pulmonary function.\", \"answer_choice\": C}"]
