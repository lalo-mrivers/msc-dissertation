["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents discuss the role of iodine in various biochemical processes related to thyroid hormones. The formation of molecular iodine during oxidation of iodide by the peroxidase/H2O2 system leads to the formation of iodinium ions which bond to thyroglobulin, a crucial step in the biogenesis of thyroid hormones. Additionally, inorganic iodide inhibits the hydrolysis of thyroglobulin and iodination of thyroidal proteins. These findings suggest that iodine plays a key role in the synthesis of thyroid hormones.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
