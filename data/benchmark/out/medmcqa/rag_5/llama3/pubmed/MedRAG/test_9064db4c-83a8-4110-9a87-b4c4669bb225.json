["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking what metal oxides in porcelain provide except. After reading the provided documents, I noticed that metal oxides are added to improve bonding between ceramic and metal. In the article 'Adherence controlling elements in ceramic-metal systems. I. Precious alloys.', it is mentioned that SnO2 provides continuity of electronic structure between alloy and ceramic structures and is a primary factor in controlling ceramic-metal adherence. This suggests that adding metal oxides improves bonding. Therefore, I will look for options related to bonding.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"]
