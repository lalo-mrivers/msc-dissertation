["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the storage temperature of RBC, Platelet, and FFP. We can find this information from the provided documents. The document 'Preparation and storage of platelet concentrates' mentions that platelets should be stored at room temperature (22 degrees C). Another document 'Blood components in the treatment of acute blood loss' mentions that red-cell concentrates with hematocrits of 70 volumes percent can be prepared from whole blood at the time of collection and frozen either shortly thereafter or after storage at 4 degrees C for up to 3 weeks. The document 'Effects of prolonged room temperature holding of whole blood intended for preparation of components' indicates that platelet concentrates stored at 4 degrees C provide platelets that are hemostatically effective immediately upon infusion but have poor circulation, while those stored at 22 degrees C provide platelets with good circulation but upon transfusion have impaired hemostatic effectiveness. Finally, the document 'A study of variables affecting the quality of platelets stored at \"room temperature\"' mentions that a temperature of storage less than 24 C is essential for satisfactory preservation of platelet integrity, function, and post-transfusion survival.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
