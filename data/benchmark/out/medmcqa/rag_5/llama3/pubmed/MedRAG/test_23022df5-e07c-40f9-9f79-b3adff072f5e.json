["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a marathon runner who has been experiencing pain in the anteromedial tibia on regular walking/jogging for long hours. The X-ray is normal, which suggests that the pain may be related to overuse or stress rather than a bony abnormality. A bone scan was ordered by the doctor, which implies that the doctor is suspecting some kind of stress reaction or inflammation in the tibia.
