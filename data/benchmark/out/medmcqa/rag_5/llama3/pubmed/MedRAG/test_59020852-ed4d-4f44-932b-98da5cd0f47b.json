["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents discuss Phase I clinical trials. According to 'Phase I cancer trials: limitations and implications', the goal of Phase I clinical trials is to establish a maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and a tolerable dose range for future efficacy testing. Similarly, in 'Bayesian methods for phase I clinical trials', the aim is to determine the dose-response curve of a new drug with respect to toxic side effects and estimate the MTD. Therefore, it can be inferred that the major aim of Phase I clinical trials is to establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and determine the dose-response curve.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
