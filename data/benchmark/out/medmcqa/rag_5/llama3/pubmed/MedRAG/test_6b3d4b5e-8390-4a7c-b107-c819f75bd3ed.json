["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the optimum BMP dose for osteogenesis. In the document 'Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMP-2 and BMP-3) promote growth and expression of the differentiated phenotype of rabbit chondrocytes and osteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cells in vitro.', it is mentioned that 100 ng/mL of BMPs was found to be the most potent stimulator of ALPase activity in osteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cells. This suggests that a higher concentration of BMPs may not necessarily be beneficial for osteogenesis, as seen in the document 'Dose-dependent stimulation of bone induction by basic fibroblast growth factor in rats.'. Therefore, it is likely that the optimum dose for osteogenesis is below 100 ng/mL.\", \"answer_choice\": C}"]
