["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Since the case report is about self-induced abortion, it's likely that IPC (Indian Penal Code) section dealing with illegal abortion would be relevant. Considering the documents provided, specifically 'The law and planned parenthood case report. 1942', I found no direct mention of IPC sections.
