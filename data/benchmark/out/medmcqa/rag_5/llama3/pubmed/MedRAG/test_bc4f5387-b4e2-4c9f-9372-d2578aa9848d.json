["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents discuss various methods for detecting adventitious viruses in cell cultures used in the production of biotechnology products. The use of established genetically engineered cultures in the production of biologicals for human use requires that these cultures be monitored for adventitious viral agents. Since virus isolation is a key step in monitoring, I will look into the selection of cell culture systems for virus isolation. According to the document 'Selection of cell culture systems for virus isolation', different cell cultures are suitable for isolating specific viruses. Primary, diploid, and continuous cell cultures have different susceptibility levels to various viruses. Considering this information, I can conclude that virus is cultured in a cell culture system.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
