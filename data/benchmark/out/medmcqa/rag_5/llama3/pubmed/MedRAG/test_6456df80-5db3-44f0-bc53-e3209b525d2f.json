["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with ascending muscle weakness for 2 days. The limb is flaccid. This suggests a neuromuscular disorder. Since the question asks about the first investigation to be done, I will focus on identifying potential causes of this presentation. A possible cause could be myasthenia gravis or Guillain-Barr√© syndrome. However, these conditions typically present with more prominent cranial nerve involvement and would likely require a more comprehensive evaluation. Another possibility is polymyositis or quadriceps myositis, which can present with muscle weakness. Since the patient has ascending muscle weakness, this could be a sign of autoimmune disorder. In that case, I would focus on ruling out electrolyte imbalances as a potential cause.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
