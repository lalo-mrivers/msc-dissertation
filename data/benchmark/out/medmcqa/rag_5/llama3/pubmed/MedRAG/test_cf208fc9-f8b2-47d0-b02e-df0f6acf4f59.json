["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided, we can deduce that nerve fibers in pulp are autonomic nerves. The autoradiographic study of sensory innervation of teeth (II) reveals that both dental pulp and periodontium receive sensory innervation from the trigeminal ganglion in the form of plexuses and free and organized sensory receptors, including apparent corpuscular ones. This suggests that the nerve fibers in pulp are autonomic nerves, which are responsible for conveying sensory information to the brain.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
