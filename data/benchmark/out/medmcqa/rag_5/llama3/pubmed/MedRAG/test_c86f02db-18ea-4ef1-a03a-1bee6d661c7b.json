["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about syndromes caused by uniparental disomy. We need to identify which of the given options is not an example of such a syndrome. According to the provided documents, Pseudo-trisomy 13 syndrome is mentioned as possibly representing autosomal recessive inheritance or dominant new mutations, but it is not explicitly stated that it is caused by uniparental disomy. On the other hand, Prader-Willi and Angelman syndromes are classic examples of syndromes caused by uniparental disomy. Russell-Silver syndrome is a condition where there is growth restriction and dysmorphic features, but its etiology is more complex and not exclusively due to uniparental disomy. Bloom syndrome is a genetic disorder characterized by short stature, skin rash, and an increased risk of cancer, but it is not directly related to uniparental disomy. Therefore, the answer choice that is not an example of a syndrome caused by uniparental disomy is Russell-Silver syndrome.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
