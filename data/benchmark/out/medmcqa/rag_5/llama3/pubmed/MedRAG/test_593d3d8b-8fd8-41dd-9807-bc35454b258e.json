["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the most recent oral direct thrombin inhibitor (DTI) for acute stroke prevention. None of the provided documents directly mention Ximelagatran, Idraparinux, Wasfarean, or Dabigatran. However, according to 'Molecular approaches to antithrombotic therapy', new agents have been found to be more specific and hemostatically safer than warfarin or heparin. This suggests that the most recent oral DTI for acute stroke prevention is likely one of these newer agents. Of the provided choices, Dabigatran is the only oral DTI mentioned in existing research. Therefore, it can be inferred that Dabigatran is the most recent oral direct thrombin inhibitor (DTI) for acute stroke prevention.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
