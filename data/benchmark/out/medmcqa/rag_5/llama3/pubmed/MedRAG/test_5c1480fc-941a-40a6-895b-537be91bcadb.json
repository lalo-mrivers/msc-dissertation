["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about bone loss seen annually after 1 year in a functional implant. We need to find the relevant information from the provided documents. The document 'A study of 589 consecutive implants supporting complete fixed prostheses. Part I: Periodontal aspects' provides information on marginal bone loss for maxillae and mandibles. It states that for fixtures in the maxillae, the mean marginal bone loss was 0.7, 0.1, and 0.2 mm for each of the first 3 years of loading, respectively; for fixtures in mandibles, the corresponding values were 0.7, 0.2, and 0.1 mm. We are interested in annual bone loss after 1 year, so we will focus on the first year's value which is 0.7 mm for both maxillae and mandibles.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
