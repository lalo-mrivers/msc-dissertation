["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the timing of surgery for cleft lip. The relevant document is 'Repair of cleft lip and palate: 1. Surgical techniques.' It states that it is considered unacceptable to leave a child with an unrepaired cleft in developed countries, as opposed to Sri Lanka where growth of the facial skeleton is normal without surgery. This implies that surgery should be carried out at some point after birth. The other documents do not provide direct information on the timing of surgery for cleft lip. Therefore, we can rule out options A and D, which are too early or too late, respectively. Options B (2-12 months) and C (3-6 months) are more plausible. The choice ultimately depends on the severity of the cleft and individual factors.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
