["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To calculate pulmonary compliance, we need to use the formula: Compliance = ΔV / ΔP, where ΔV is the change in lung volume and ΔP is the change in intrapleural pressure. Given the tidal volume of 500 mL, the change in lung volume (ΔV) would be 500 mL. The change in intrapleural pressure (ΔP) would be -5 cm of water (since it decreased by 5 cm from -4 to -9 cm). We can then plug these values into the formula: Compliance = 500 mL / (-5 cm) * (1 L / 10 cm). This gives us a value of approximately 0.2 L/cm.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
