["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about confirming the diagnosis of an internal derangement of TMJ fracture. From the provided documents, we know that panoramic views are suitable for examining supine patients with multiple injuries and suspected jaw fractures. We also know that MRI can be used to assess internal derangement and other temporomandibular joint-related symptoms.
