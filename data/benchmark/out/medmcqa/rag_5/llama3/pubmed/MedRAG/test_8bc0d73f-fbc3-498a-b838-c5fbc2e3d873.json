["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the purification, characterization, and immunolocalization of fimbrial protein from Porphyromonas (bacteroides) gingivalis. It is mentioned that a 43 kDa fimbrial protein was purified and its homogeneity confirmed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis. The amino acid composition and sequence of the first 30 amino acid residues are consistent with the predicted composition and sequence from the cloned gene of the fimbrial subunit. This suggests that the major fimbrial structural component of P. gingivalis is the 43 kDa protein.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C: Fim A\"\n}"]
