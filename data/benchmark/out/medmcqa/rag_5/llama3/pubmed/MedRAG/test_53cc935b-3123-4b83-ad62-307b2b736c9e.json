["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the provided documents, we can identify three cases of subepidermal bullous diseases: Epidermolysis bullosa acquisita, a case of subepidermal blister disease associated with autoantibody against 450 kD protein, and Subepidermal bullous disease. A correlated clinico-pathologic study of 51 cases. All three cases have histological features showing a subepidermal bulla. The Epidermolysis bullosa acquisita case specifically mentions a dermal infiltrate of inflammatory cells and thick linear deposits of immunoreactants along the dermo-epidermal junction. Therefore, we can infer that these blisters are located at the deepest layer possible, which is the dermis.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
