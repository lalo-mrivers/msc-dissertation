["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks which muscles will tend to pull the mandible back following bilateral mandibular fracture in the canine region. From the given documents, we can infer that the maxillary canine tooth may contribute to mandibular fracture. However, this information does not directly address the question. Therefore, we need to focus on the anatomy of the mandible and its surrounding muscles. The genioglossus muscle inserts onto the mandible and runs posteriorly, which means it would tend to pull the mandible back. Additionally, the masseter muscle also inserts onto the mandible and runs in a direction that would pull the mandible back. Considering these anatomic details, we can deduce that the muscles that will tend to pull the mandible back are those that insert onto the mandible and run posteriorly.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: Genioglossus and masseter\"\n}"]
