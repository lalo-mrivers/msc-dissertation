["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents provided discuss various aspects of muscle testing and electromyography. None of the documents explicitly mention the card test or specify a particular muscle being tested. However, one document mentions the measurement of maximal isometric muscle strength in the fingers (Method for measurement of maximal isometric muscle strength with special reference to the fingers). This suggests that finger muscles might be involved in some aspect of the card test.
