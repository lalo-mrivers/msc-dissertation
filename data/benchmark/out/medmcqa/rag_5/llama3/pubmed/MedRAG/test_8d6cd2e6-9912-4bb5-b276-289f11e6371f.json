["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the composition of KRI paste. None of the relevant documents mentioned KRI or its composition. However, one document discussed prophylaxis pastes and mentioned a sodium-potassium aluminum silicate abrasive system. Another document mentioned UV-hardened artificial filling materials. But none of these seem to be related to KRI. Therefore, we need to rely on general knowledge of dental fillings and prophylactic agents. Iodoform is not typically used in dental fillings or prophylaxis. Camphor and menthol are commonly used in toothpaste and mouthwash but are not typical components of dental fillings. ZOE refers to zinc oxide-eugenol, a common component of dental filling materials. Calcium hydroxide is also a common component of dental filling materials.\", \"answer_choice\": B}"]
