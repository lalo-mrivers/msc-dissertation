["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the presence of dentin islands in the root canals of specific permanent teeth. The relevant documents mention odontoblast processes and dentin production. One document mentions that odontoclastic resorption takes place at the pulpal surface of coronal dentin prior to shedding of deciduous teeth, but it does not explicitly mention permanent teeth or root canals. Another document discusses scanning electron microscopic examination of resected areas of human teeth, which could be relevant, but it does not specifically mention dentin islands. The last document describes the growth of human dentine and mentions the life cycle of odontoblasts, which might be related to dentin production, but again does not explicitly mention permanent teeth or root canals. Therefore, we need to look for another source that provides information about dentin islands in specific permanent teeth. Unfortunately, none of these documents provide such information.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
