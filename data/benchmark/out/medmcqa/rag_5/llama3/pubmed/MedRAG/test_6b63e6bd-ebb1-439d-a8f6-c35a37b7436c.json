["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To calculate the anion gap, we need to first subtract the chloride level from the sodium level. This gives us 137 - 110 = 27. Then, we add the bicarbonate level to this result: 27 + 15 = 42. Finally, we subtract the phosphate level from this result: 42 - 3 = 39.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
