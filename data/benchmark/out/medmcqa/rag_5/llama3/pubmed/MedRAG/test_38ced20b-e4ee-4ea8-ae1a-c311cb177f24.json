["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking at what age root resorption starts. The documents provided mention the stages of resorption based on the criterion of Fanning, et al. In the document 'Radiographic observations on root resorption in the primary dentition', it states that the average age for each root resorption stage was lower in girls than in boys regardless of differences in sex or arch. Specifically, the document mentions that the average age for 1/4 resorption of the primary root corresponded to the period between completion of the permanent crown and initial root formation of the successional permanent tooth. This suggests that root resorption starts at a young age, possibly around 3-5 years old.\", \"answer_choice\": B}"]
