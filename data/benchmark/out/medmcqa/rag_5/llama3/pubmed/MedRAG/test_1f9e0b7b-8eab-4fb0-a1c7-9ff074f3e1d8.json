["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about anaphylaxis, which is a medical condition. The relevant documents provided are about magnetic resonance imaging, mathematical description of structures, effects of repeated presentation of stimuli, literature and medicine, and the increase in books and articles on death and dying. Since these topics do not relate to anaphylaxis, I will need to consider general medical knowledge to answer this question. Anaphylaxis is a severe allergic reaction that occurs within minutes to hours after exposure to an allergen. It typically involves a rapid onset of symptoms, such as hives, itching, swelling, stomach cramps, diarrhea, and difficulty breathing. There is no mention of delayed reactions in the description of anaphylaxis. The other options do not seem relevant to anaphylaxis either.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: None of the above\""]
