["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about anti-cholinergic drugs that don't cross the blood brain barrier and placenta. We need to look at the relevant documents for information on these boundaries. From the 'Neurohistochemical evidence' document, we know that there is no adrenergic or cholinergic innervation in the human placenta and umbilical cord. This suggests that some anti-cholinergic drugs may not cross the placental barrier. The 'Placental transfer and fetal uptake of 3H-digoxin in humans' document shows that digoxin does cross the placental barrier, but we are looking for an anti-cholinergic drug that doesn't. From the 'Physostigmine's effect on diminished fetal heart rate variability caused by scopolamine, meperidine and propiomazine' document, we know that physostigmine crosses the placental barrier. We also have information from the 'Drug transport across the blood--brain barrier' document about the anatomical and physiological aspects of blood-brain transport, including the presence of specialized carrier systems which may facilitate transport. Finally, we can look at the passage of S(+) and R(-) gamma-vinyl-GABA across the human isolated perfused placenta for information on how certain compounds are transported through the placenta. Based on this information, it seems that some anti-cholinergic drugs like scopolamine may not cross the blood brain barrier or placenta.\",\n\"answer_choice\": A"]
