["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question states that an affected male does not have affected children but an affected female always has affected children. This suggests that the trait is inherited differently in males and females. The pedigree information from previous research suggests autosomal-dominant, sex-limited inheritance, which means that males with the condition are not likely to pass it on to their sons. Females with the condition would be carriers and have a 50% chance of passing the condition to each child. This fits with the observed pattern that an affected female always has affected children.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C: X linked dominant\""]
