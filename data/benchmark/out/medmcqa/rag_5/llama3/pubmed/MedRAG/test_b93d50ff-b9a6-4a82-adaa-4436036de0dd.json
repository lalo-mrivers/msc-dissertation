Since the question asks about the maximum incidence of C-shaped root canals, we can look at the provided documents for any information on this topic. The only relevant mention is in the document discussing C-shaped canal configurations in mandibular molars, where it says that 14% of roots had C-shaped canals.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: Mand 2nd molar\"\n}"]
