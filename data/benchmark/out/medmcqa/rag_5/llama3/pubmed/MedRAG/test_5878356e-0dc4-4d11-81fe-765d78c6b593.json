["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the provided documents, we can see that the study on 'Transient reversal of the stretch reflex in human arm muscles' discusses the behavior of stretch reflex responses of arm muscles evoked by torque motor perturbations applied before and during a catching task. It is mentioned that at the elbow joint, reflex coactivation resulted from a transient reversal of the direction of the short-latency responses of flexor muscles, with little changes of the responses of extensor muscles. This suggests that the arm movement is not simply 1-dimensional, but rather involves complex interactions between multiple joints and muscles, which can be represented in 2 dimensions or even 3 dimensions.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
