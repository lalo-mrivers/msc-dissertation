["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents discuss radiation-induced DNA damage, residual DNA damage, and cell death. The 'Residual DNA damage' document states that residual damage is likely to be responsible for cell death either by physical restriction of replication or transcription or by metabolic disruption due to loss of function of critical genes. The 'Role of DNA double strand breaks in ionizing radiation-induced killing of eukaryotic cells' document reviews the evidence implicating DNA double stranded breaks as lesions relevant for cell killing, suggesting that residual DNA damage may lead to cell death.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
