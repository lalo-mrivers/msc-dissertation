["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents provide information about the tendinous structure in human masticatory muscles. According to the Analysis of the tendinous structure in human masticatory muscles, the development of bundles of the tendon was examined and found to be composed of many collagen fibers and a few elastic fibers. In the masseter muscle, the property of the tendon differs in the distribution and size of collagen fibers and elastic fibers compared to other masticatory muscles. This information does not directly address the maximum masticatory forces taken up by which fibers. However, it provides context for understanding the structure and properties of the tendinous system in masticatory muscles.\n\nThe documents Effects of intense chewing on some parameters of masticatory function and Masticatory function--a review of the literature do not provide direct information about the maximum masticatory forces taken up by which fibers. However, they do describe various aspects of masticatory function, including the effects of intense chewing and the changes in masticatory efficiency, maximal occlusal force, and occlusal force endurance time after prosthodontic treatment.\n\nThe document Masticatory function - a review of the literature, III does not provide direct information about the maximum masticatory forces taken up by which fibers. However, it reviews the literature on mastication and discusses various aspects of masticatory function, including masticatory efficiency and performance.\n\nThe document Masticatory function in patients with extensive fixed cantilever prostheses provides some relevant information. According to this study, all patients reported that their masticatory function had been substantially improved after prosthodontic treatment. The study also found that masticatory efficiency improved after treatment because both the number of cycles before the initial swallow and the total number of strokes including the time for completed mastication diminished after treatment.\n\nBased on this analysis, it appears that the relevant information is not directly addressed in any one document. However, the documents do provide context and information about various aspects of masticatory function, including the effects of intense chewing and the changes in masticatory efficiency, maximal occlusal force, and occlusal force endurance time after prosthodontic treatment.\n\nTherefore, it seems that the answer is not explicitly provided by any one document. However, based on the analysis, it appears that the maximum masticatory forces are likely to be taken up by the fibers in the masseter muscle.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
