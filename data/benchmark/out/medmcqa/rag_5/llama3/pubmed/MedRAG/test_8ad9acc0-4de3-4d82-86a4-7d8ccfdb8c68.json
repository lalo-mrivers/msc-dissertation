["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about periapical bone resorption. The case report on progressive external root resorption mentions cells that showed an intense acid phosphatase activity, similar to that of bone-resorbing cells. This suggests that the resorption might be due to osteoclastic activity. In another article, multiple idiopathic root resorption is discussed and it is proposed that MIRR results from microbiologically-induced osteoclast activity facilitated by prior osteoblast activation. Both cases suggest a role for osteoclasts in bone resorption. Therefore, the answer should relate to these cells or their activity.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: None\"\n}"]
