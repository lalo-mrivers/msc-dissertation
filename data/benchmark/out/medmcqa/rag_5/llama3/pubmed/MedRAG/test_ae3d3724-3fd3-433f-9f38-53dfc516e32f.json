["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the resting membrane potential (RMP) where there is no net electrogenic transfer. This means that the sum of the electrochemical potentials for the ions X, Y, and Z is zero. The given values are V=-30 for the voltage and RMP. Since there is no net electrogenic transfer, the equation can be written as 0 = -30 + Z*F/kT, where F is the Faraday constant, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature in Kelvin. Solving for Z, we get Z = (30*F)/(k*T).\",\n\"answer_choice\": D\n}"]
