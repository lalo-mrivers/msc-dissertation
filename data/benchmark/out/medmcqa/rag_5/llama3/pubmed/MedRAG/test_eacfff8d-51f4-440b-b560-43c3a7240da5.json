["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe craniosynostosis as a condition where the coronal suture fuses prematurely.

This information suggests that early fusion of the coronal suture results in a skull deformity, which matches with option D: Scaphocephaly.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
