["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, we need to determine the minimum sample size required for the study. The prevalence of disease is expected to be 50% with a desired confidence interval of 45-55%. Using the nomograms for obtaining a necessary, minimum sample size, II, when the distribution of proportions from binomial data is approximately normal, we can calculate the minimum sample size needed. Given the prevalence and desired confidence interval, we can use the nomograms to determine the required sample size.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
