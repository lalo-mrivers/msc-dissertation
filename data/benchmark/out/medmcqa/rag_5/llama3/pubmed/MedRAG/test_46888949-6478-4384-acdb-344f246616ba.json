["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the type of bond found in GIC. The relevant documents discuss bonding of glass-ionomer cement (GIC) to enamel, composite resin, and other surfaces. The bonds are typically evaluated through shear force experiments or three-point flexural jig testing. There is no direct mention of covalent, ionic, hydrogen, or metallic bonds in the provided documents. However, it can be inferred that the bonds formed between GIC and various surfaces are likely non-covalent, as they involve the interaction of ions or molecules.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
