["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe intrafusal muscle fibers. In the first document, it is mentioned that the 'initial burst' of muscle spindle afferents with or without terminals on the bag1 intrafusal muscle fibre. The initial burst has been re-examined following conditioning of the muscle to investigate its intrafusal origins. The burst was present in the response to stretch of spindle afferents that innervated the bag1 fibre and those that did not. There was, however, a difference in amplitude of the burst.\", \n\"answer_choice\": \"C: None\""]
