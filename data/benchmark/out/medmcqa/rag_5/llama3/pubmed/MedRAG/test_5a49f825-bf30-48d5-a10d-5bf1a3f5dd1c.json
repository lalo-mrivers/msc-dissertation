["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe basal cell carcinomas. The first document presents a cytological diagnosis of 153 skin lesions, including 131 basal cell carcinomas. It does not mention histopathological features. The second and fourth documents discuss the clinical and biological behavior of basal cell epitheliomas, but do not provide specific information about characteristic histopathological features. However, the third document discusses epidermal cytoplasmic antigens, which are differentiation antigens that stratify in different layers of the skin. This suggests that basal cell carcinomas may have specific histopathological features related to their differentiation. In particular, nuclear palisading is a feature described in some basal cell carcinomas.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
