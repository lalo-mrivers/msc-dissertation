["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the different types of metastasis that can occur from oral cancer. The document 'Metastases to lymph nodes of the head and neck from an unknown primary site' suggests that survival correlates best with stage of disease prior to treatment, indicating that lymph node involvement is a common route for metastasis. Additionally, the document 'Metastatic carcinoma to the tongue: a report of two cases and a review of the literature' states that most metastatic tumors of the oral cavity are located in the mandible while only a small percentage are found within the soft tissues. Furthermore, 'Treatment of oral carcinoma with selective therapy for the individual patient' suggests that careful follow-up is essential to recognize early recurrence or metastatic disease. Lastly, '[Metastasis in oral squamous cell carcinoma]' indicates that the overall incidence of regional lymph node metastasis was 49.4%. Therefore, it can be inferred that the most common route for metastasis of oral cancer is through lymphatics.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
