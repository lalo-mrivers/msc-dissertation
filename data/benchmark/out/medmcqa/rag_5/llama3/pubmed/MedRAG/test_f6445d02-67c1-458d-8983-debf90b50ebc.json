["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the nucleus that has cardio-inhibitory function. From the documents, we can see that the medullary raphe gives rise to a monosynaptic, inhibitory projection on sympathetic preganglionic neurons, which participates in the central control of cardiovascular function. This suggests that there is an inhibitory pathway involving the medulla, and this pathway is related to cardiovascular function. Therefore, it is likely that one of the nuclei involved in this process has cardio-inhibitory function.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
