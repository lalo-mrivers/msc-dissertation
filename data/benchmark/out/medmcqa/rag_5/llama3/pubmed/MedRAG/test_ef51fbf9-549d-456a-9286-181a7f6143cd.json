["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the diffusion capacity of carbon monoxide. We need to look for documents that relate to this topic. The first document discusses the effect of varying alveolar oxygen partial pressure on diffusing capacity for nitric oxide and carbon monoxide, membrane diffusing capacity, and lung capillary blood volume. This document doesn't provide any information about decreased diffusion capacity of carbon monoxide.\n\nThe second document examines the effect of smoking cessation on pulmonary carbon monoxide diffusing capacity and capillary blood volume. It mentions that there is a rapid improvement in DLCO after smoking cessation, suggesting that smoking had previously decreased DLCO.\n\nThe third document evaluates the effect of breathing 100 ppm of carbon monoxide versus compressed, purified air for 1 hour on exercise performance in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. This document doesn't provide any information about decreased diffusion capacity of carbon monoxide.\n\nThe fourth document determines the acute effect of cigarette smoking on the carbon monoxide diffusing capacity of the lung. It mentions that DLCO (in ml/min/mm Hg) corrected for COHb back pressure decreased from 22.5 before smoking to 21.0 after smoking, indicating a decrease in diffusion capacity.\n\nThe fifth document associates neutrophil concentration in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid with recent losses in diffusing capacity in men formerly exposed to asbestos. This document provides information about the relationship between neutrophils and decreased diffusion capacity.\n\nBased on these documents, we can conclude that diffusion capacity of carbon monoxide is decreased in all except... none! All the documents suggest a decrease in diffusion capacity of carbon monoxide.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
