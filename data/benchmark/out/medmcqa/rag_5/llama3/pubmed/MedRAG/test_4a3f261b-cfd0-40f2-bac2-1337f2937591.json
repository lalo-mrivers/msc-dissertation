["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents describe the relationship between pregnancy and gingivitis. The first document states that there is a significant increase in the severity of gingivitis during pregnancy, and that the gingival changes are more marked than the periodontal changes seen during pregnancy. This suggests that hormonal changes during pregnancy contribute to the development of gingivitis. The second document confirms this, showing an increase in gingival inflammation between the 14th and 30th weeks of pregnancy despite a fall in plaque at the dento-gingival junction. The increased levels of estradiol and progesterone during this time may be contributing factors. The third and fourth documents provide additional evidence for the role of female sex steroids in gingivitis, showing that the addition of estradiol-17beta or a mixture of estradiol-17beta and progesterone to incubation media containing normal or inflamed gingiva causes an increase in the synthesis of prostaglandin E2. This suggests that hormonal changes during pregnancy may enhance gingival inflammation.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"None of the above (the answer is related to hormonal changes during pregnancy, not bacteria)\""]
