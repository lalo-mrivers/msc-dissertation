["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for a landmark that marks the opening of the pup chamber. The provided documents are about embryonic development, neuronal differentiation, ablation of olfactory pits, and retinal axon growth. None of these topics seem directly related to the question. However, one document mentions chick embryos and hatching movements. This might be relevant as the question is asking about a landmark in developmental biology. The document 'A method for recording the respiratory and hatching movements of the chick embryo' describes making an artificial air space in the pipped egg and measuring pressure changes during hatching. It does not specifically mention pup chamber opening, but it talks about hatching movements. This might be related to the question.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
