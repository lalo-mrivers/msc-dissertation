["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 3-year-old with painless progressive bilateral facial swellings. This makes me think of conditions that affect the parotid gland or surrounding tissues. I look at the provided documents and see cases related to parotomegaly, cystic lesions, and fibrous dysplasia. However, these cases do not match the patient's symptoms and age. Albright's syndrome is a possibility, but it typically affects older patients and has a different clinical presentation. The absence of immunological markers for Sj√∂gren's syndrome also rules out that condition. I then consider other conditions that can cause bilateral facial swelling, such as granuloma faciale or dermoid cysts. However, these conditions are not typically seen in young children and do not explain the painless nature of the swellings. Therefore, I conclude that the diagnosis is most likely Cherubism.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
