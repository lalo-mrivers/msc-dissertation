["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The study on premolar rotation shows that the second premolars in both upper and lower arches which erupted rotated had a tendency to improve over the observed period. The paper on mandibular premolars with three root canals does not provide any information about the shape or characteristics of individual premolars. The case report on extraction of a completely impacted upper second deciduous molar also does not provide any information that would help answer this question. The papers on crown component variation in hominoid lower second premolars and bilateral maxillary and mandibular fourth molars are unrelated to the shape or characteristics of individual premolars. Therefore, we need to look at the morphology of premolars. According to the paper [The extraction of a completely impacted upper second deciduous molar: case report], the tooth germ of the succedaneous premolar develops on the lingual side of the deciduous molar and moves in the level of the occlusal plane of the primary molar.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
