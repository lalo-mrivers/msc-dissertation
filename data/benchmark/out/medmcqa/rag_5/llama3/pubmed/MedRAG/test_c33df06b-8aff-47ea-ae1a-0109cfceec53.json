["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the true statement regarding the nerve supply of the adrenal gland. We need to find relevant information from the provided documents. The first document talks about lamellated sensory nerve endings in guinea-pig adrenals, but it doesn't provide information about the nerve supply of the human adrenal gland. The second and third documents are more relevant as they discuss the anatomy and imaging techniques used for the diagnosis of adrenal glands. However, they don't specifically mention the nerve supply of the adrenal gland. The fourth document, which talks about beta adrenergic stimulant suppression of efferent activity of the adrenal nerve, provides the most relevant information. It suggests that the adrenal nerve has a nerve supply and that it can be influenced by beta adrenergic receptors.\",\n\"answer_choice\": A"]
