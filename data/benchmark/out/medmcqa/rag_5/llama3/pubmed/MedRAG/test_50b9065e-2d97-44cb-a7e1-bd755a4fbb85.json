["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"None of the provided documents discuss the topic of metal freezing or mold walls. The study on fluidized melt-granulation discusses the formation of granules using a fluidized-bed granulator, but does not mention porosity or metal freezing. The other studies are unrelated to this topic. Therefore, I can conclude that none of the studies provide information about the type of porosity formed due to simultaneous nucleation of solid grains and gas bubbles at the first moment that metal freezes at the mold walls.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
