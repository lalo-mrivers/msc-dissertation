["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the provided documents, it can be seen that the main focus is on supernumerary teeth, orthodontic treatment, removal of malpositioned premolars and canines, changing dentition, and intraoral third molar transplants. None of these topics are related to buccal coil springs or the specific complication mentioned in the question. Therefore, it can be inferred that the complication is not directly related to orthodontic treatment or supernumerary teeth. The only relevant information regarding premolars and molars can be found in 'Observations on two cases of change in the dental arch and occlusion during the period of changing dentition.' This document states that the space for the permanent buccal teeth increases during the eruption of the permanent canine and first premolar, making it possible for these teeth to align normally. Therefore, it can be concluded that the complication is related to the movement or alignment of premolars. Among the given options, the only one that is relevant is option D: Tendency of 1st premolar to intrude.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
