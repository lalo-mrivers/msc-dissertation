["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the arterial supply of the Submandibular gland. From the given documents, we can see that there are multiple studies on the microcirculation of the salivary gland. One study mentions the organization of the salivary gland microcirculation and mentions that flow in the capillaries around the acini slowed initially before increasing, while flow in the intralobular duct capillaries increased soon after beginning stimulation. Another study talks about the histochemical study of catecholamines and cholinesterases in the autonomic nerves of the human minor salivary glands, which does not provide information about the arterial supply. The study about degenerative changes in the histology of the human submandibular salivary gland occurring with age provides some general information about the gland but does not mention the arterial supply. Finally, a study about relation of the external carotid artery to the parotid gland (author's transl) mentions that the external carotid artery takes its course 'through the gland' and that it was found to lie in a more or less superficial groove on the medial surface of the gland. This implies that the ECA branches may supply the submandibular gland.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: Facial\"\n}"]
