["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To find the standard error, we need to calculate it using the formula: Standard Error = Standard Deviation / Square Root of Sample Size. Given that the average Hb is 10 gm% and the standard deviation is 1, we can plug in these values into the formula. The sample size is 100 women. Therefore, the square root of the sample size is âˆš100 = 10. Then, Standard Error = 1 / 10 = 0.1.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
