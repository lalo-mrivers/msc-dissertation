["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents discuss ionized calcium concentrations. In lactic acidosis, plasma ionized calcium concentrations are decreased. Low plasma ionized calcium was also observed in critically ill patients who required extensive pharmacologic support of the circulation. Additionally, hypocalcemia occurred in patients with low-flow states and was not readily corrected by intravenous administration of calcium salts. This information suggests that a low concentration of ionized calcium in the serum is associated with various conditions.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
