["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the AO system of fixation. After reviewing the documents, I see that there's no direct mention of the AO system in any of them. However, I notice that the document on 'Compression fixation of Bennett's fracture' does discuss a procedure for fixing a specific type of fracture using a lag-screw technique and Kirschner wire. This suggests that the AO system might be related to orthopaedic surgery or bone fixation techniques. Upon further analysis, I recall that the AO system is a method of internal fixation in trauma surgery, which involves compressing the fracture site to promote healing. Given this context, I think the question is asking about how the AO system approaches fixation when adequate bone buttressing is present.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
