["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the amount of heat required to change boiling water into vapor. This process involves a phase transition from liquid to gas. Based on the provided documents, 'Latent Heat' refers to the heat required for a phase transition, such as evaporation or condensation. Since the process involves changing boiling water into vapor, it is a case of evaporation. Therefore, the correct answer would be related to latent heat of vaporization.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
