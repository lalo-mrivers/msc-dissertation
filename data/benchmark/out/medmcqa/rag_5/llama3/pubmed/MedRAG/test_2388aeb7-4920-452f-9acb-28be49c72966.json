["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about autoinfection caused by helminths. The provided documents discuss Strongyloides stercoralis and its ability to cause disseminated disease, but they don't specifically mention the other options. Therefore, we need to look beyond the given documents. Autoinfection refers to the process by which a helminth can reinfect its host internally without an external source of infection. Enterobius vermicularis is a nematode that causes pinworms and has been known to cause autoinfection in humans. Hymenolepis nana is also a nematode that can cause autoinfection. Taenia solium is a tapeworm that typically infects the intestine but can cause cysticercosis in other parts of the body. Ascaris lumbricoides is a roundworm that causes ascariasis and does not typically cause autoinfection.\n\nBased on this information, we can conclude that all helminths listed except one can cause autoinfection: Taenia solium. Therefore, the correct answer is C: Taenia solium.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"]
