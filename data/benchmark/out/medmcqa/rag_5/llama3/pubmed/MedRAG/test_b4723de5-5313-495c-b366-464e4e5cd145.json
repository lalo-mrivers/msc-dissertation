["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided, it is clear that the mechanism of adhesion of GIC restoration with tooth surface is related to its chemical properties. The paper 'Chemical adhesion in dentistry' explains that a chemical bridge between two different types of materials works in dentistry. Additionally, the paper '[Effect of different enamel structures on bonding of glass ionomer cements]' discusses the adhesive strength of GIC for bracket bonding and its relationship with surface characteristics of the enamel. From these findings, it can be inferred that the mechanism of adhesion is not related to carboxyl group or C=C double bond, but rather through chelation with metal ions.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
