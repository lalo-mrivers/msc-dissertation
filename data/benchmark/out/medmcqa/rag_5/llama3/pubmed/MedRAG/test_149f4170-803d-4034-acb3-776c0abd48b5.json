["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents describe various anchoring techniques used in orthodontics. The first document discusses raising the root using bonded wires to establish anchorage and avoid adverse tooth movement. This suggests that anchorage is being applied here, but it's not the type mentioned in the question options. The second document describes a technique for permanent retention of teeth repositioned by orthodontic means. Anchorage is again discussed as necessary to stabilize the anchor unit. The third document presents a study on differential moments in establishing and maintaining anchorage control. This further supports the idea that anchorage is being applied here. The fourth document mentions an anchor screw for active elongation treatment of impacted teeth, which also implies the use of anchorage.
