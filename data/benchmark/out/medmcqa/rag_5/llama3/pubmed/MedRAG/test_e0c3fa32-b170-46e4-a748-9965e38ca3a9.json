["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Since we're looking for the electric resistance between oral mucosa and PDL, we need to focus on the documents that discuss electrical properties of the oral mucosa. The document 'Electrical resistance of rabbit submaxillary main duct: a tight epithelium with leaky cell membranes' provides relevant information. It measures the electrical resistance of the main duct epithelium in different solutions and determines the effects of various substances on this resistance. We can conclude that there is no direct information about the electric resistance between oral mucosa and PDL in the provided documents, as they do not specifically mention such a measurement.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
