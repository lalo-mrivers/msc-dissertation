["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents provide information on HIV diagnosis, management, and epidemiology. The most important document for this question is the 'Update on HIV infection' as it discusses the recent advances in therapy and the role of primary physicians. According to this article, prolonged survival and earlier intervention have resulted in an increasing role for primary physicians in clinical and laboratory monitoring. This suggests that post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) may be recommended.\n\nThe document 'HIV-1 infection: Diagnosis and management' also provides relevant information on PEP. It mentions that many different therapeutic strategies for HIV-1 infection are being evaluated, but until the immune suppression is eradicated, presumably through more effective antiviral therapy, complications of AIDS and HIV-1 infection will continue to be encountered.\n\nThe document 'Guidelines for disclosing HIV-antibody test results to clients' does not provide direct information on PEP, but it highlights the importance of early intervention in the management of HIV infection. The document 'The validity of self-reported HIV antibody test results' provides some information on the reliability of patient-reported test results, but this is not directly relevant to the question.\n\nBased on the information provided, lamivudine (or similar antiretroviral therapy) may be used as part of a PEP regimen. Washing hands is also an important aspect of infection control and would likely be advised after the accidental prick. Viral markers at the time of the prick may not be directly relevant to the management of the nurse, but it could provide some information on the severity of the exposure.\n\nRepeat serology at 6 weeks may be recommended to confirm whether the PEP was effective or not. Therefore, options b, c, and d are likely true, while option a is false as lamivudine would not be used as monotherapy in PEP.\", \"answer_choice\": A}"]
