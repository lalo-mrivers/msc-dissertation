The audiogram shows a 30-40 dB gap between AC-BC of the right and left ear. Rinne's test is negative, and Weber's test centralizes. Functional hearing loss is likely due to careful attention being given to certain aspects of the initial basic audiometric examination, which often stands out and points clearly toward functional loss. Modified approach to conventional audiometry has enabled detection of almost all cases of functional hearing loss without resorting to special audiometric tests designed for that purpose.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
