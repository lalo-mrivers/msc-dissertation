The 'Evaluation of effects of application of a citroxain-containing dentifrice' document documents the benefits of a citroxain-containing dentifrice, but doesn't specifically discuss periodontal patients. The 'Determination of fluoride and chlorhexidine from chlorhexidine/fluoride-containing dentifrices' document studies the interaction between fluoride and chlorhexidine in dentifrices, but doesn't provide recommendations on dentifrice choice for periodontal patients. The 'Rinses to control plaque and gingivitis' document reviews mouthrinses as an adjunct to brushing with a dentifrice, but doesn't provide specific recommendations on dentifrice choice.
