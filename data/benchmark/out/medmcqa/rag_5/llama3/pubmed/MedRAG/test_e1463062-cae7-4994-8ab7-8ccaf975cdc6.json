["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the provided documents, I can see that R-802 is active against Enterobacteriaceae, but less effective against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. HR 756 is also tested against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and shows a MIC of 11.1 mcg/ml. Cefazaflur has negligible activity against Pseudomonas, and PC-904 inhibits 89% of Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates at a concentration of 1.56 mug/ml.\n\nPC-904 is the only antibiotic that exhibits significant activity against both Pseudomonas and indole-positive Proteus species. Therefore, it is likely that this antibiotic would be effective against pseudomonas and indole-positive proteus.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
