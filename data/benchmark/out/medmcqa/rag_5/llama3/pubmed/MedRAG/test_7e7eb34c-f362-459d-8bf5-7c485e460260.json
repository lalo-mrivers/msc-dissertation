["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about Inca bone or Goethe's ossicles.

Since Inca bone or Goethe's ossicles are mentioned in this context, it is likely that they refer to these ossicles.

However, we can deduce that they are present in the squamous occipital bone, possibly near the bregma or lambda.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
