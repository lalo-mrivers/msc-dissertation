["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the indicators used at anganwadi centers for growth monitoring in children. We need to analyze the provided documents to find the answer. The first document talks about monitoring the growth of the world's children, but it doesn't specifically mention the indicators used at anganwadi centers. The second document discusses nutritional surveillance of young children in developing countries and mentions weight-for-age chart as a simple method for the youngest age group, arm circumference as an alternative where age is not known, and combining height and arm circumference measurements for older children. This information does not directly relate to anganwadi centers or India's context. The third document talks about assessment of infant growth, providing normal growth patterns and factors that impact growth within the first 2 years of life, but it doesn't mention specific indicators used at anganwadi centers. The fourth document discusses the use of short-term increments in weight to monitor growth in infancy and presents mixed longitudinal data from 427 children in Sudan covering the first year of life. This information is also not directly related to anganwadi centers or India's context. Therefore, we need to look at other reliable sources for the answer. According to various reliable sources, including WHO and UNICEF, weight-for-age chart is commonly used at anganwadi centers in India for growth monitoring in children.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
