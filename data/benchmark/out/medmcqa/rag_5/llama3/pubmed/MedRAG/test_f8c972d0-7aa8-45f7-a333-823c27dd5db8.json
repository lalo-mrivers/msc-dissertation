["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"None of the provided documents discuss maximum alveolar aerial oxygen difference. However, we can rule out Pulmonary embolism (A) as it is not related to oxygen concentrations. Severe asthma (B) and Interstitial lung disease (C) are also unrelated to the effects of oxygen on peripheral airways or pulmonary absorption-excretion volume. Foreign body in upper airway (D) does not relate to alveolar aerial oxygen difference either.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
