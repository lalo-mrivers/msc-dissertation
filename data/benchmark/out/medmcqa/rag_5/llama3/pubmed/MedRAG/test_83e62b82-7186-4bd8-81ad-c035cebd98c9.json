["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents discuss the association of Clostridium difficile with diarrhoea. In the first document, it is mentioned that elderly hospitalized patients should be investigated for this organism in a similar way to Clostridium difficile if symptoms occur. The significance of antibiotic association is suggested and cross-infection was shown to be a possibility. This suggests an association between antibiotics and Clostridium difficile. In the second document, a review of 66 cases of antibiotic-associated colitis since March 1975 is presented, which have been associated with a 27 per cent mortality. Although the disease is rare, it is more common than previously reported. The presentation, methods of diagnosis and treatment are discussed. This further supports an association between antibiotics and Clostridium difficile. In the third document, it is mentioned that no age or gender-specific high incidence was observed. Clinical presentation in these patients revealed no distinctive pattern. Both dysenteric and diarrhoeal presentations were found, the latter being more frequent. The results suggest that Clostridium difficile by itself may be a causal agent of acute diarrhoea. This suggests an association between antibiotics and Clostridium difficile.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"None of the above\""]
