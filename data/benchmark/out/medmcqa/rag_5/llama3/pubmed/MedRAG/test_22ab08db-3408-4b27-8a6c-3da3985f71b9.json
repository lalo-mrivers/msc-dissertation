["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the stage of spermatocyte maturation where independent assessment of maternal and paternal chromosomes occurs. The provided documents do not explicitly state this information. However, we can infer from the information that during gametogenesis, both maternally and paternally inherited methylation patterns are erased in primordial germ cells and distinctive patterns emerge during germ cell maturation. In the case of the paternal allele, the methylation pattern found in sperm undergoes further modification during embryogenesis. This suggests that the maternal and paternal chromosomes may be distinguished at some stage of spermatocyte maturation.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
