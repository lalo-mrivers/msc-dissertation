["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking what is false about light-cure composite. The options provided are related to the use of light-cure composite in dentistry. Based on the provided documents, it can be seen that the variables affecting light energy absorption by the composite have been examined for their effect on polymerization contraction. Since the polymerization contraction is closely associated with the degree of cure of the restoration, this parameter served as an empirical indicator for the extent of polymerization. From the document 'Curing light performance and polymerization of composite restorative materials', it can be seen that a linear relationship was demonstrated between polymerization contraction and light intensity. The polymerization contraction of a microfilled composite and posterior composite, using a constant curing time and light intensity, decreased linearly with increasing sample thickness. This implies that the polymerization reaction does not continue for a period of 72 hours. Additionally, the document 'Biologic esthetic restorations' suggests that less than optimal light output of the curing light source can be compensated by increasing application time within reasonable limits. Therefore, option C is false.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
