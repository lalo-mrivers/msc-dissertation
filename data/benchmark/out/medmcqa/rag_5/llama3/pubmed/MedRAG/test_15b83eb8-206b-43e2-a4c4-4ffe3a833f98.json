["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to the 'Optical transmittance of reflecting wedges' study, the original light intensity diminished by 83.9% when the light was reflected perpendicularly to the growth axis. This indicates that a significant amount of light was lost due to reflection. Therefore, we can conclude that the light transmitting wedges transmit less than 20% (100% - 83.9%) of incident light.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
