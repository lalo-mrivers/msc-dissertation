["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe various aspects of parotid gland surgery and facial nerve injuries. Since the question is about numbness on shaving after parotidectomy due to a specific nerve injury, we can focus on the nerves that are related to sensation in the area. The facial nerve (cranial nerve VII) is responsible for motor control of the face, but it also has sensory branches that supply the anterior two-thirds of the tongue and the soft tissues of the face. On the other hand, the auriculotemporal nerve (a branch of the mandibular division of the trigeminal nerve) supplies sensation to the skin overlying the parotid gland and surrounding areas. The greater auricular nerve (also a branch of the mandibular division of the trigeminal nerve) provides sensation to the skin on the side of the head, including the ear and the cheek. The occipital nerve (a branch of the suboccipital nerve) is not directly related to sensation in the area around the parotid gland. Given that numbness on shaving after parotidectomy is a possible complication, it is most likely due to injury to the greater auricular or auriculotemporal nerves.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
