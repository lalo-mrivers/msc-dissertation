["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the provided documents, we know that residual monomer in acrylic polymers can affect their properties. In one of the documents, it is mentioned that the extraction of n-butyl methacrylate from an experimental bone cement was very much less than that of methyl methacrylate from a proprietary bone cement. This suggests that excessive amounts of monomers can lead to issues with the final product. Additionally, in another document, it is mentioned that IR data indicated that the monomer continued to escape from the product after it had hardened. This further supports the idea that excessive amounts of monomer can cause problems. Therefore, we can infer that if an excessive amount of monomer is incorporated into an acrylic resin mixture, it may result in issues such as\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
