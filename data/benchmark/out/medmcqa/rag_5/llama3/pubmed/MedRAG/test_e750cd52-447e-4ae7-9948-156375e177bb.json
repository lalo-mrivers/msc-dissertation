["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe various techniques for noninvasive cardiac exploration. Ultrastructural artefacts in biopsied normal myocardium suggest that biopsy artefact can occur. Clinical overview of management of chronic ischemic heart disease highlights the importance of defining the information needed from tests. The contribution of nuclear medicine and ultrasounds in cardiac surgery mentions the mutual contributions of physical techniques, including isotopic and ultrasonic methods. Colour Doppler velocity imaging of the myocardium demonstrates a technique for producing images of tissue motion within the myocardium. Special investigations in COCM: biochemical analysis of cardiac biopsies shows the potential of combining static and dynamic studies.\n\nThe question asks about the best noninvasive investigation to check for viability of myocardium. Considering these documents, it seems that nuclear medicine techniques are relevant to this inquiry. Specifically, MIBG scintigraphy is a nuclear medicine technique used in assessing the viability of myocardial tissue.\n\nTherefore, I will choose an answer based on the information provided. The correct answer is B: MIBG scintigraphy.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
