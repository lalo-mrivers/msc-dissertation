["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the most useful parameter according to WHO for assessing adequacy of sperm for fertilization. The relevant documents discuss semen parameters, including morphology evaluation using strict criteria and progressive motile sperm density. The first document mentions that there are differences in sperm velocity values between normozoospermic men and those with proved fertility, suggesting that morphology evaluation may be important.
