["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To calculate the absolute risk reduction (ARR) and relative risk (RR), we need to first find the number of patients who developed HT complications in both groups. In the control group, 180 out of 15225 patients developed HT complications, which is a proportion of 0.012 or 1.2%. In the intervention group, 162 out of 15225 patients developed HT complications, which is a proportion of 0.011 or 1.1%.\n\nThe ARR represents the absolute difference in the risk of developing HT complications between the two groups. It can be calculated as:\n\nARR = Control group - Intervention group\n= 0.012 - 0.011\n= 0.001\n\nSo, the ARR is 0.1% or 1/1000.\n\nThe RR represents the ratio of the risk of developing HT complications in the intervention group to that in the control group. It can be calculated as:\n\nRR = (Proportion of patients who developed HT complications in intervention group) / (Proportion of patients who developed HT complications in control group)\n= 0.011 / 0.012\n= 0.92\n\nSo, the RR is approximately 0.9.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
