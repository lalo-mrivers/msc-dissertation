["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the distal palatal termination of the maxillary complete denture base. The relevant documents mention the maxilla and its features. The posterior maxillary osteotomy is described as a treatment alternative for various dentofacial conditions, and the impression technique for complete maxillary immediate dentures mentions making impressions of the edentulous area and remaining dentition in sections. There is no direct mention of vibrations, fovea palatine, tuberosity, or maxillary torus in these documents. However, the tuberosity is a prominent landmark on the palate. Since the distal palatal termination refers to the posterior part of the palate, it is likely related to the tuberosity.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"]
