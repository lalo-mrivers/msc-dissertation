["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the orientation of fibers in different muscles. From the provided documents, it can be inferred that parallel-oriented fibers are those with a classical pinnate arrangement. This type of arrangement reduces the per-fiber force contribution but increases the total physiological cross-section and total muscle force. The document on 'Muscle architecture in relation to function' discusses this type of arrangement.\n\nAfter reviewing the possible choices, it can be seen that options B, C, and D all have parallel-oriented fibers. The Saorius muscle has a more complex arrangement, as discussed in the document on 'Formation of highly organized skeletal muscle fibers in vitro'.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A: Saorius.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
