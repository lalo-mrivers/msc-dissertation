["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents discuss thermoregulation in neonates and the importance of maintaining a homeothermic state. The first document mentions that healthy term babies have a limited thermogenic response to a cool environment over the first 12 hours of life, indicating that they are more susceptible to cooling during this period. The second document discusses the Porta-Warm mattress as an effective adjunct to the transport incubator for keeping newborns warm during transport, implying that it is suitable for use in cooler environments. The third and fourth documents provide information on heat loss in neonates, including the importance of high relative humidity and the role of insulation in reducing heat loss by evaporation. Based on this information, it can be concluded that a warmer temperature would be beneficial for maintaining a homeothermic state.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
