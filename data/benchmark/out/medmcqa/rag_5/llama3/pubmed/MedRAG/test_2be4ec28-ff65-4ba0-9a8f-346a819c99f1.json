["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Thiamine is mentioned as being involved in pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency, and also as a cofactor for transketolase activity. This suggests that thiamine plays a role in cellular metabolism through its interactions with these enzymes. Additionally, the document on thiamine deficiency mentions that some non-localizing symptoms may be occasioned by faulty glucose metabolism at the cellular level from a relative lack of thiamine. This implies that thiamine is necessary for normal glucose metabolism, and that a deficiency would result in decreased metabolic activity.\",\n\"answer_choice\": A"]
