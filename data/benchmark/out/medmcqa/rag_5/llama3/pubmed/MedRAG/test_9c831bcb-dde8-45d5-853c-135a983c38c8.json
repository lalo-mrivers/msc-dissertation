["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, we need to compare the variance of diastolic blood pressure (DBP) with the variance of vitamin D. To calculate the variance of DBP, we use the provided mean and standard deviation (SD): variance = SD^2 = 11^2 = 121. For vitamin D, we also use the provided mean and SD: variance = SD^2 = 3^2 = 9. Now, let's compare the variances: 121 (DBP) > 9 (Vitamin D). Therefore, we conclude that...\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
