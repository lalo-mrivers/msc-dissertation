["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about which antibiotic chelates with calcium. From the provided documents, we can see that ionomycin (also known as A23187) is a divalent cation ionophore antibiotic that complexes and transports calcium ions in a one-to-one stoichiometry. Additionally, tetracycline was found to reduce the permeation rate of calcium ions, indicating some sort of interaction between the two. However, it's not clear if this interaction is chelation or something else.\n\nLooking at the other options, penicillin and cephalosporins are both types of antibiotics that target bacterial cell walls, but there is no mention of them interacting with calcium in any way. Erythromycin is a type of macrolide antibiotic that targets protein synthesis, again without any mention of interaction with calcium.\n\nGiven the information provided, it seems most likely that either ionomycin or tetracycline would be the correct answer. However, since we are looking for an antibiotic that specifically chelates with calcium, I will lean towards ionomycin as the more likely candidate.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
