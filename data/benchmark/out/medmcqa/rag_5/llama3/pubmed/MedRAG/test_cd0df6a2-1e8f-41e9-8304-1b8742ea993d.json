["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the relevant documents, specifically 'Teratogenic risks of antiepileptic drugs in respect to the type of epilepsy', it is mentioned that the incidence of malformations and/or miscarriage-stillbirths was higher in offsprings born to mothers with secondary generalized epilepsy or complex partial seizures. Although it is difficult to separate the possible role played by antiepileptic drugs from that of predisposed severity of epilepsy, the teratogenic risks due to medication appeared to be more plausible. Polypharmacy and overdose regimen should be avoided by all means especially during the earlier period of pregnancy.\n\nThe document 'Pregnancy and epilepsy' also highlights the importance of minimizing fetal exposure to anticonvulsants while controlling maternal seizures.\n\nConsidering these points, it can be inferred that certain anti-epileptics may have a higher risk of congenital malformation. Specifically, Valproate is mentioned in the same document as being associated with a higher risk of teratogenic effects. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that Valproate might be an anti-epileptic associated with congenital malformations.\n\nPhenytoin and Phenobarbitone are mentioned as anticonvulsants generally preferred for initial therapy of most seizure disorders, but there is no specific mention of them being associated with congenital malformation.\n\nCarbamazepine is not explicitly mentioned in the relevant documents, so its association with congenital malformations cannot be determined based on this information. However, considering that it is a common anticonvulsant used to treat epilepsy, it is likely that some studies may have investigated its teratogenic effects. If such studies were found to indicate no significant risk of congenital malformation, then Carbamazepine might not be associated with it.\", \n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
