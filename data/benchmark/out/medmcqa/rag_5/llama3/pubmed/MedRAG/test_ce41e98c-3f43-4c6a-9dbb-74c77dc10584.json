["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents discuss the formation of axial organs in chick embryos, including the development of somites. The papers mention the role of mesoderm in inducing neural cell identity and controlling neural patterning. However, none of the provided documents explicitly discuss extra-embryonic mesoderm or its origin. Therefore, we must look for indirect clues. The term 'mesoderm' is often used to describe the tissue involved in inducing neural cell identity, but this is different from extra-embryonic mesoderm. We can infer that extra-embryonic mesoderm is not related to the formation of somites or axial organs, as these topics are already addressed in the provided documents. Instead, we must consider the context of embryonic development and the relationships between hypoblast and primary/secondary yolk sac.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
