["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The given information is from a study that investigated the relationship between lactobacillus count and caries activity. The study found that numerical domination of particular sites by S mutans before detection of caries can occur, but has only been observed so far in 2 of 15 sites. Similarly, it was observed that after detection of caries, there is a rise in the isolation frequency and mean numbers of S. mutans. This trend was particularly obvious in one subject who developed bilateral lesions by the second examination. A similar observation has been made with lactobacilli.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
