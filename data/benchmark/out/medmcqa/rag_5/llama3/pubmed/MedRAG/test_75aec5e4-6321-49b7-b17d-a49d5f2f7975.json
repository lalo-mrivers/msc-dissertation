["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The problem of Class III malocclusion has been discussed, but the critical evaluation of ANB angle shows that it depends not only on anteroposterior relationship of jawbones but also on maxillary inclination and prognathism. Therefore, in a skeletal Class III case, the value of ANB will be influenced by these factors. The comparison of outcomes of orthodontic and surgical-orthodontic treatment of Class II malocclusion in adults shows that surgery resulted in greater reduction of overjet and greater improvement in most cephalometric skeletal, dental, and soft tissue criteria. Early orthopedic treatment for class III skeletal patterns shows a decrease in the gonial, mandibular, and SNB angles. Therefore, we can conclude that the value of ANB will be lower than normal in a skeletal Class III case.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
