["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the main cause of pain during pulpal injury progression. The relevant articles discuss endodontics, pulpitis, and pain control. After reviewing these documents, I found that pain control in endodontics is paramount to patient acceptance, and alleviating existing pain is the primary objective of root canal therapy.
