["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Given the patient's symptoms of breathlessness and shock following a steering wheel injury to the right side of chest, I will focus on the patient's cardiovascular and respiratory systems. The first step is to assess the patient's jugular venous pressure (JVP) to differentiate tension pneumothorax from cardiac tamponade. A tension pneumothorax would show a reduced or absent JVP, while cardiac tamponade would show an elevated JVP. Next, I will evaluate the patient's pulse pressure, which is typically increased in cardiac tamponade due to the impeded ventricular filling. Breath sounds and heart sounds are also important to assess, but the primary focus is on JVP and pulse pressure.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
