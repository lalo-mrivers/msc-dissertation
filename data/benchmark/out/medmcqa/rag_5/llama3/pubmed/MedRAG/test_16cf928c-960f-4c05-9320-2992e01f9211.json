["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about which anticonvulsant causes contraction of visual field. After reviewing the provided documents, I notice that Diazepam is mentioned in one of them as causing severe visual field loss, but this effect reverts to normal on cessation of the drug.
