["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks to identify which of the given options are not continuous variables. We can analyze each option separately: A: Height in cms - This is a measure of physical attribute and is typically measured in small units, making it a continuous variable. B: Weight in kg - Similarly, weight is also a measure of physical attribute and is typically measured in small units, making it a continuous variable. C: Blood groups A. B. ABO - This is a categorical variable as it only takes on specific values (A or B). D: Age in years and months - Although age can be measured in fractional months, the year-to-year variation is significant enough to consider age as a continuous variable.\n\nBased on this analysis, we can conclude that C: Blood groups A. B. ABO is the only option that is not a continuous variable.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
