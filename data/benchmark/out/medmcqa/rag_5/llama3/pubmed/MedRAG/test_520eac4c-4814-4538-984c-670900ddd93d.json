["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has brown coloured urine and oliguria since 3 days, with mild facial puffiness and pedal edema. The urinalysis shows RBCs 100/hpf and granular casts, which suggests glomerular disease. The presence of 3+ proteinuria and the hypertension (BP 126/90) also support this diagnosis. IgA nephropathy is a possibility, but it typically presents with asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic hematuria, whereas this patient has oliguria and facial/pedal edema. Minimal change disease and FSGS are less likely due to the presence of granular casts. Membranous glomerulonephritis can present with hematuria and proteinuria, but it usually doesn't have RBCs or granular casts in the urinalysis.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D\n}"]
