["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the principle secretory cells found in the single layer outlining the pulp. The relevant document 'Regulatory factors in pulp biology' doesn't provide a direct answer. However, we can look at another document 'Vacuolisation of odontoblasts and regressive metamorphoses from viewpoint of pulp-dentin system function'. It describes the biological functions of the cell with particular reference to the cell's vacuolar apparatus, and characterizes the pulpodentinal system outlining the functional adaptation of the endodontal vascular apparatus. This suggests that the single layer outlining the pulp is likely related to odontoblasts.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
