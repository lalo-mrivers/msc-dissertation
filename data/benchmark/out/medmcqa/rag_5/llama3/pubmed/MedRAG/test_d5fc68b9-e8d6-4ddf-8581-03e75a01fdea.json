["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the possibility of delayed neuronal migration and organization leading to certain disorders. Migrational disorders are mentioned in the first document as being related to fetal diseases that become manifest before midgestation. The second document discusses glial-guided neuronal migration, which is a hallmark of cortical development. The third document shows different migratory pathways in the developing cerebral cortex. The fourth document talks about modulators of neuronal migration and neurite growth. Considering these documents, it is clear that neuronal migration plays a crucial role in the formation of the brain. Delayed neuronal migration and organization would likely lead to disorders such as polymicrogyria or lissencephaly, which are characterized by abnormal brain folding patterns.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
