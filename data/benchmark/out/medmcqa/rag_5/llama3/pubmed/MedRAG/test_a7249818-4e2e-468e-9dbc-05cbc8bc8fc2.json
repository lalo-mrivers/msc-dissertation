["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about processes that take place in mitochondria. From the provided documents, we know that mitochondria are responsible for metabolic activities such as beta-oxidation of fatty acids and protein import. DNA synthesis is mentioned as part of nuclear control over mitochondrial genes, but it does not occur directly within mitochondria. Fatty acid synthesis also occurs in the cytosol, not in mitochondria. Protein synthesis can take place on both ribosomes and mitochondria, so it's not explicitly excluded from the options. However, protein import into mitochondria is a different process than protein synthesis. Therefore, we can rule out DNA synthesis and fatty acid synthesis as processes that occur in mitochondria.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
