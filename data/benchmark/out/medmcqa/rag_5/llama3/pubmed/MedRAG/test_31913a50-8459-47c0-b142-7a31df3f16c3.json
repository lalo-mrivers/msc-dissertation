["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks for a false statement regarding sensory endings. The relevant information can be found in the 'Neuropathic pain and injured nerve: peripheral mechanisms' document, which talks about the electrical excitability of sensory neurons. This does not provide direct information on sensory endings. However, we can look at other documents, such as 'Neurourology of spinal cord-injured patients', which discusses dermatome examinations for sensation. The document also mentions the importance of ordering the patient to close their eyes and the need to rule out physical tone and wishful thinking or paresthesias/dysesthesias. This does not directly relate to sensory endings either. Therefore, we must look at other documents that provide information on sensory endings, such as 'Technical artifact simulating \"motor axonopathy\"'. The document mentions nerve conduction studies revealing low compound motor amplitudes, normal motor conduction velocities and normal sensory nerve studies, which is a general statement about sensory nerves but does not directly relate to sensory endings. We can also look at the 'An empirical note on tonic neck reflexes: control of the upper limb's proprioceptive sensation' document, which discusses proprioception and kinesthetic input, but this too does not provide direct information on sensory endings. The only relevant document that provides information on sensory endings is the 'Visceral nociceptors: a new world order?' document, which talks about different categories of visceral sensory receptors, including high-threshold receptors and intensity-encoding receptors. This information can be used to determine the false statement regarding sensory endings.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
