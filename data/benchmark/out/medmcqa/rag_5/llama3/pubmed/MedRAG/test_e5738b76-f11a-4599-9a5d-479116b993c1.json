["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the causes of vasodilation. We can start by looking at the documents provided. One of the key points is that the endothelium plays a major role in modulating vascular tone and regulates vasomotion through the liberation of vasoactive compounds, including nitric oxide. Nitric oxide is known to be the active chemical species responsible for the vasodilator action of nitrovasodilators. Additionally, hydrogen peroxide can produce either vasodilation or constriction via stimulation of prostaglandins. Therefore, we can conclude that vasodilation is caused by nitric oxide and/or hydrogen peroxide.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
