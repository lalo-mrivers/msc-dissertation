["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The passage describes the structure of chromosomes at various levels. It mentions metaphase chromosomes, chromatin fibers, and nucleosomes. The question asks about microscopic examination of chromosomes' shape, size, and arrangement. This suggests that we need to look for a term related to chromosome analysis or classification. The passage does not mention inheritance testing, genotyping, or chromosomal mapping as these are unrelated to the examination of chromosome structure. Therefore, the correct answer is B: Karyotyping.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
