["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The concept of counter bevel is related to tooth wear and its mechanisms. The paper 'Organic tooth wear--overlooked in anatomy texts' discusses how attritional wear of teeth is a natural protective mechanism that preserves oral, pharyngeal, and respiratory physiology throughout life. This suggests that the counter bevel might be important for preserving these physiological pathways.\n\nConsidering this, we can look at the surfaces of premolars mentioned in the paper. None of them mention anything about the facial, occlusal or lingual surface of premolars having a specific relevance to tooth wear and counter bevel.\n\nThe relationship between the mobility of human teeth and their supracrestal fiber support is discussed in another paper, which does not provide any information relevant to this question.\n\nA key to understanding extraoral forces is mentioned, but it does not provide any insight into the concept of counter bevel in tooth wear.\n\nSupracrestal fiberotomy is a surgical technique that has no connection to the concept of counter bevel in tooth wear. Therefore, we can conclude that the correct answer must lie in one of the options related to premolar surfaces.\n\nGiven these points, it becomes clear that there is no specific surface where a counter bevel should not be given. The option D: Any surface of premolar seems most likely.\", \"answer_choice\": D}"]
