["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the maximum buffering capacity. Buffering capacity refers to the ability of a substance to resist changes in pH by neutralizing excess hydrogen ions or hydroxide ions. Ampholytes, such as amino acids, have buffering capacities due to their ability to donate and accept protons. Histidine is an example of an amino acid with a high buffering capacity, making it more likely to be the correct answer.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
