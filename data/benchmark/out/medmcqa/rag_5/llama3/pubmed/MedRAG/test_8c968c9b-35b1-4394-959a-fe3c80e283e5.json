["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the rooting reflex, also known as the search reflex. This reflex disappears around the time of axon sectioning, which was examined in the first document. The article states that before the severed axons reinnervated muscle, reflex latency was prolonged, and reflex amplitude was depressed. Following reinnervation of muscle, reflex latency returned to preoperative levels, while amplitude recovery was typically more variable. This information suggests that the rooting reflex disappears around 2-3 months after birth, which is consistent with other studies.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
