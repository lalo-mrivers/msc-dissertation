["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about a breastfed child with hypernatremia (serum sodium > 170 mEq/L). The urine sodium is 70 mEq/L. Considering the relevant documents, hypernatremia can be caused by excessive water loss with diarrhea and excessive solute load secondary to inappropriate preparation of formula. However, this scenario does not fit the context of a breastfed child. Therefore, we need to focus on other possible causes. The clinical manifestations of hypernatremia vary depending on the degree of dehydration and rate at which the hyperosmolar state has been reached. The management of the patient will depend on the mechanism of hypernatremia and degree of dehydration. Given that this is a breastfed child, it's unlikely to be due to excessive intake of sodium or formula preparation error. Considering the context, acute necrosis is also an unlikely cause.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
