["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the primary effect of tongue movement. In the provided documents, it is mentioned that reversible, cooling-induced inactivation of the face motor cortex results in a severe impairment in the ability of monkeys to perform a tongue-protrusion task. This suggests that the face motor cortex plays an important role in controlling tongue movements. Furthermore, it is stated that many neurons at 'tongue-MI' sites received intraoral mechanosensitive afferent input and their activity was related to a tongue-protrusion task performed by a monkey. This implies that the primary effect of tongue movement is likely to be on the tongue itself or its surrounding muscles.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
