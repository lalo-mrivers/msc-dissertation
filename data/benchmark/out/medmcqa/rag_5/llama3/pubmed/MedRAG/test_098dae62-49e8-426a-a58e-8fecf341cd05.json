["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the process of annealing as a process where complementary RNA strands come together to form a double-stranded structure. This is also referred to as the 'annealing' of the RNA strands. Therefore, we can conclude that annealing refers to the process of bringing complementary RNA strands together to form a stable double-stranded structure.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
