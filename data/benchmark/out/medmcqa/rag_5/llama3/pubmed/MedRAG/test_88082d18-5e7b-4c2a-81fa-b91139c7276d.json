["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the thickness of luting cement. We can find information about film thicknesses in the provided documents. The first document 'Film thickness of new adhesive luting agents' mentions that nine materials satisfied the ADA type I specification for film thicknesses less than 25 microns, and five other materials met the ADA type II specification for film thicknesses of less than 40 microns. This suggests that luting cement film thickness can be as low as 20-40 Î¼.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
