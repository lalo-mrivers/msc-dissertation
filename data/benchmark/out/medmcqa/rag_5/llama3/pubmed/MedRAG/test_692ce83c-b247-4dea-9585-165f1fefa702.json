["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant document is 'In vitro evaluation of dynamic fluid displacement in dentinal tubules activated on pin placement.' It states that the dye in pinholes was displaced toward the path of least resistance, and fluid in a pinhole can contribute to crazing of the dentin during placement. This suggests that pinholes should be placed in a way that minimizes movement of fluids and reduces risk of tooth damage. Given this information, it is likely that the direction of placement of retentive pin holes should be parallel to the external tooth surface.\", \"answer_choice\": B}"]
