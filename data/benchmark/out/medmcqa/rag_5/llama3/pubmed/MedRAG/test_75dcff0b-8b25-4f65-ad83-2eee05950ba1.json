["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question mentions prematurity in centric occlusion but not in eccentric movements. This is a specific clinical scenario described in the article 'Premature loss of primary teeth: part I, its overall effect on occlusion and space in the permanent dentition'. According to this article, premature loss of primary molars causes changes in regard to space and sagittal molar relations in the permanent dentition. Therefore, when there is a prematurity in centric occlusion but not in eccentric or other movements, it means that the teeth are not aligned properly in their normal position (centric occlusion), but this problem does not affect the way they move or fit together (eccentric and other movements).\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
