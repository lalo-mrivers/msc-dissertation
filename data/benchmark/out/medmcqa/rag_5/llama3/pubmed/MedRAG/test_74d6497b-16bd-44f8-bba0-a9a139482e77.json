["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the wave patterns of EEF, ECG, and EMG. Since this is a multiple-choice question, I will analyze each option: A (NREM sleep), B (REM sleep), C (Wakefulness), and D (Quiet wakefulness). The documents provided are related to electrocardiography, electromyography, and biofeedback, but none of them mention sleep stages or quiet wakefulness. Electronic ECG simulator is about generating normal and abnormal waveforms for educational purposes. 3-dimensional graphic display of electrocardiograms describes the visualization of heart activity on the body surface. Active cables for use with dry electrodes for electrocardiography compares ECG recordings from dry electrodes via active cables to conventional electrodes with electrode paste. Baseline variability as a predictor of EMG biofeedback performance investigates the relationship between baseline EMG variability and subsequent EMG reduction. Influence of mechanical properties on the relation between EMG activity and torque examines the mechanical properties of muscle groups responsible for forearm movement.\n\nConsidering these documents, there is no direct information about wave patterns of EEF (electroencephalography), ECG (electrocardiography), or EMG (electromyography) that would link to any specific sleep stage or wakefulness state. Therefore, I will eliminate options A-D as they are not supported by the provided documents.\", \n\"answer_choice\": \"Not Provided\"\n}"]
