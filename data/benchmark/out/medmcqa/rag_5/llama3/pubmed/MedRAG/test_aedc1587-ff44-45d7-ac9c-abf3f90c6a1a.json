["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about characteristic features of superior semicircular canal dehiscence. The relevant documents are the ones that discuss labyrinthine anomalies and diseases associated with inner ear anomalies. We can start by looking at the document 'Congenital anomalies of the inner ear: introducing a new classification of labyrinthine anomalies' which discusses various types of inner ear anomalies, including those affecting the semicircular canals. However, this document does not specifically discuss superior semicircular canal dehiscence.\n\nNext, we can look at the document 'Labyrinthine window rupture' which discusses a condition where there is sensorineural deafness due to labyrinthine window rupture. This document does not mention superior semicircular canal dehiscence either.\n\nThe document 'Preservation of cochlear function after extensive labyrinthine destruction' also does not discuss superior semicircular canal dehiscence.\n\nFinally, we can look at the document 'Acute cochleovestibular dysfunction' which presents a case of acute vertigo and sudden deafness with concomitant eye lesions. This document mentions Tullio's phenomenon which is a characteristic feature of superior semicular canal dehiscence.\n\nTherefore, all the documents suggest that Tullio's phenomenon is a characteristic feature of superior semicircular canal dehiscence, making option C true.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
