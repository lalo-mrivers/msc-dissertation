["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the biomechanics of the facial skeleton article, it is mentioned that the mandible does not have a consistent 'neutral' axis during mastication. This means that even if there was a standard neutral zone, it would not remain constant and devices placed there would not function with mechanical advantage in tension or compression loading. Therefore, when loading the fracture mandible posterior to the site of fracture, we need to consider the load characteristics of the fracture. The article also mentions that the plating systems rely on adequate bone apposition at the fracture site, which provides a stable condition under functional loading.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
