["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the induction of inhalational agent being faster. We can compare this with the provided documents. In 'Vital capacity breath technique for rapid anaesthetic induction: comparison of sevoflurane and isoflurane', it is mentioned that the mean time for induction of anaesthesia with sevoflurane (120 s) was significantly shorter than with isoflurane (145 s), reflecting its higher blood-gas solubility. This suggests that agent with high blood gas solubility induces faster.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
