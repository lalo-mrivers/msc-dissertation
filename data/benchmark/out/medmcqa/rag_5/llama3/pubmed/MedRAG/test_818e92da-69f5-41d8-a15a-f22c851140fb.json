["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents suggest that hypnozoites (latent stages) exist for some species of Plasmodium, which can cause relapse. The document 'The persistence and recurrence of S-antigen in Plasmodium falciparum infections in man' mentions the existence of considerable antigenic heterogeneity among P. falciparum populations. This implies that there may be different strains or sub-species within P. falciparum. In contrast, the document 'Relapse/reinfection patterns of Plasmodium vivax infection: a four year study' reports on relapses and reinfections with P. vivax, highlighting its potential to cause multiple recurrences. This information suggests that relapse is more common with Plasmodium vivax.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
