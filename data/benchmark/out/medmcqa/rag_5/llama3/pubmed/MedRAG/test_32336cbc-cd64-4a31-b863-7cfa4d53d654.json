["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about a single accessory canal arising from the coronal third of mandibular molars. From the provided documents, we can see that three cases of C-shaped canal configurations were described in mandibular molars. This finding was similar for each case: it was impossible to diagnose the condition on the preoperative radiograph. The document also mentions that continuous hemorrhage and sensitivity were encountered when instruments were used. Additionally, a review of 3612 panoramic radiographs from routine dental patients indicates that the mandibular canals are usually, but not invariably, single and bilaterally symmetrical. Three distinct varieties of supplemental mandibular canals, large enough to be seen on panoramic radiographs, are described. Finally, we see that there is a possibility of more than one root canal in lower premolar teeth must be considered in the radiographic and clinical examination during root canal treatment.\", \n\"answer_choice\": C"]
