["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents discuss the porosity of acrylic materials, specifically methyl methacrylate. Porosity is mentioned as a potential issue if the resin shows it when processed. The papers suggest that porosity can be reduced by applying pressure or shortening processing time. In this context, it's likely that porosity would occur in areas where pressure was not applied or processing time was longer. This could lead to porosity on the surface, near borders, or throughout the denture depending on how the resin is processed. However, there is no specific mention of porosity occurring only in certain areas.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
