["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about a subcondylar fracture on the left side. Subcondylar fractures are typically related to mandible fractures, and the options given suggest symptoms related to mandible movements. Since it is a left-sided subcondylar fracture, it is likely that the patient has difficulty moving their jaw to the right (deviation of the mandible). This is supported by one of the case reports discussing lateral humeral condyle fractures, where patients with left-handedness had more frequent left-side injuries. Given these findings, it is reasonable to assume that a subcondylar fracture on the left side would cause difficulty moving the jaw to the right.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
