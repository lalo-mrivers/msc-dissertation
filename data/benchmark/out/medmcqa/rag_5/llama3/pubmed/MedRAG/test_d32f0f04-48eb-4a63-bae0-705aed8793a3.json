["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the process of eukaryotic protein synthesis and the factors involved. EIF-2 and EIF-3 are particularly important for binding of initiator tRNA and mRNA to the 40S ribosomal subunit. The location of these initiation factors in the complex as well as their interactions have been analyzed by biochemical methods and electron microscopy. This information suggests that the binding of eukaryotic mRNA to ribosomes is facilitated by the interaction of EIF-2 and EIF-3.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
