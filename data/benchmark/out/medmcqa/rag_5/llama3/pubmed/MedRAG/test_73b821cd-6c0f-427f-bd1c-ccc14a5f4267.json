["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents suggest that the baby is presenting with tetany, which is a symptom of neonatal tetanus. A quick scan of the first document shows that the article discusses management regimes for neonatal tetanus and complications that arise from respiratory problems. The second document highlights the importance of recognizing seizures in newborns, but it does not directly address treatment options for tetany. The third document focuses on magnesium therapy in neonatal tetany and suggests that magnesium sulphate is a recommended treatment option. Finally, the fourth document discusses anticonvulsant therapy, which may be relevant to treating seizures associated with tetanus. Based on this information, it seems reasonable to assume that the goal of initial treatment would be to stabilize the baby's symptoms rather than address the underlying cause. Calcium gluconate is mentioned as a possible treatment option in the third document, and given its role in stabilizing calcium levels, it appears to be the most logical choice for first-line treatment.\", \"answer_choice\": C}"]
