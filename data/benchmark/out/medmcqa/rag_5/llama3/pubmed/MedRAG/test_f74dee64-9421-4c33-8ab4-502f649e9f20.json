["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question compares primary and secondary teeth. From the provided documents, Physiological root resorption of primary molars states that excepting the lower first primary molar, a relatively high incidence of uneven root resorption during the exfoliative process was recorded for the upper second primary molar. This suggests that primary roots may not be as uniform in their resorption pattern compared to secondary teeth. Morphologic study of the maxillary molars states that the root lengths and curvatures were similar on the first and second molars, but different from the third molars. This implies that primary roots (first and second molars) might have a distinct shape or structure compared to secondary roots (third molars).\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
