["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the stage of tooth development when disturbances occurred. We need to look for information related to enamel formation, mineralization, or calcification. After reviewing the provided documents, we see that defects in enamel formation are characterized by abnormal crystal size and distribution (document 1). Chemical determinants of enamel hypoplasia indicate that hypocalcaemia is a significant factor, but only for teeth that developed during the hypocalcaemic episodes (document 2). There is no direct mention of calcification stage. However, document 4 discusses deciduous teeth containing histories of developmental disturbances and suggests that these structures can be studied histologically to demonstrate evidence of metabolic disturbances occurring during tooth development. This implies that disturbances can occur during early stages of tooth development, including the calcification stage.\n\nBased on this information, we can conclude that the disturbances occurred during the 'Calcification' stage of tooth development is likely to be seen in...\",\n\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: Interglobular dentin\""]
