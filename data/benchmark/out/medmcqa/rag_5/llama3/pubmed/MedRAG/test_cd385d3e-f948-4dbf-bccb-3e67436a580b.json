["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about site specificity. In molecular biology, site-specificity refers to the ability of an enzyme or protein to recognize and bind specifically to a particular DNA sequence or site. This concept is discussed in the given documents, particularly in the context of EcoRI restriction endonuclease and EcoRI DNA methyltransferase. Therefore, I will focus on these enzymes to answer the question.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
