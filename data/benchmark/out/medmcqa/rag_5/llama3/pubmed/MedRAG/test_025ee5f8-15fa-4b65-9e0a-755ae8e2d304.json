["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for a molecule with a permanent dipole. From the provided documents, we can see that the concept of electric field and dipoles are discussed. The document about internal stark effect measurement talks about the electric dipole moment difference between the ground and excited electronic states of a neutral probe molecule. This suggests that molecules with permanent dipoles do exist. From this information, I conclude that the answer is likely related to the molecule studied in this document.\", \"answer_choice\": D}"]
