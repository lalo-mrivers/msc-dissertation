["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents provide information on root fractures in permanent teeth with incomplete root formation. The provided case study describes a follow-up study of seven teeth with incomplete root formation observed after a root fracture. According to the case study, all teeth exhibited markedly increased mobility at the initial examination and slight dislocation of the coronal fragment was found in two teeth. Following reduction (two teeth) and fixation (all teeth), the observation period ranged from 1 1/2 to 19 years. Retained pulp vitality, repair in the fracture area, and approximately normal root development with closure of the apical foramen were observed in all teeth.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
