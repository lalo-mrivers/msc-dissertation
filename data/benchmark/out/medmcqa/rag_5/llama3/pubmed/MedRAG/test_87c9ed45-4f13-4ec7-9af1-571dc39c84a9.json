["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 5-year-old child with non-urticating macules and papules on the skin. The skin biopsy revealed a perivascular IgA deposition. This suggests an autoimmune blistering disorder, such as pemphigus or bullous lupus erythematosus. However, the patient's age and the presence of IgA deposition make pemphigus less likely. Bullous lupus erythematosus is also possible, but it typically affects adults.\n\nThe next step would be to consider other autoimmune blistering disorders that affect children. Henoch-Sch√∂nlein purpura (HSP) is a possibility, as it often presents with macules and papules in childhood. HSP can also cause IgA deposition in skin biopsy specimens.\n\nGiven the patient's age and the presence of IgA deposition, HSP is the most likely diagnosis.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
