["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the lingual extension of a Lower denture. The relevant documents mention the lingual design for complete lower dentures, which suggests that the lingual extension refers to the posterior part of the denture. We need to identify what limits this extension. The modiolus (A) is a muscle bundle in the neck of the mandible and is not directly related to the lingual extension of a Lower denture. The mylohyoid muscle (B), origin of genioglossus (C), and sublingual salivary glands (D) are all structures found under the tongue or attached to it, which could be relevant to the lingual extension.\n\nThe studies on the stability of total prostheses mention that the load capacity and stability of complete lower dentures increase with time of wearing. This implies that there is no inherent limitation to the lingual extension of a Lower denture. Therefore, we can conclude that the option D: Sublingual salivary glands is the correct answer because it would limit the lingual extension, but this is not supported by any evidence from the provided documents.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
