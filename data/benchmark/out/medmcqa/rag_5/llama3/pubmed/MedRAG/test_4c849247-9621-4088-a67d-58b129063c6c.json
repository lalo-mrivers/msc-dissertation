["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents suggest that herpes simplex virus (HSV) DNA can be identified using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Specifically, PCR with primers specific for the HSV DNA polymerase gene can detect HSV DNA. This method is used to diagnose HSV infections and even type-specific diagnosis of HSV infections. Therefore, it seems that the diagnosis made by a specific gene would involve the detection of HSV DNA using PCR.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
