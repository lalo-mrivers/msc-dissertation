["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the provided documents, we can see that restriction endonucleases are enzymes that recognize and cleave specific DNA sequences. One popular example is the EcoRI endonuclease, which cleaves DNA at GAATTC sites. The document also mentions EcoRV restriction endonuclease, which binds all DNA sequences with equal affinity and cleaves its recognition sequence on DNA at least a million times more readily than any other sequence.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
