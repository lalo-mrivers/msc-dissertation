["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents suggest that cyclic nucleotides are involved in the regulation of calcium in motor nerve endings and the exocytosis of transmitter. Additionally, the studies on quantal transmitter secretion from myocytes loaded with acetylcholine show that step depolarization of the myocyte membrane triggers evoked ACh release from the myocyte with a weak excitation-secretion coupling. This implies that calcium ions play a role in the exocytosis of transmitter. Furthermore, the study on stimulation by subsynaptosomal fractions of transmitter efflux from plain synaptic vesicle fraction shows that the synaptic membrane-dependent efflux appears to depend on both adenosine triphosphate and divalent cations, especially Ca2+. Therefore, it is likely that acetylcholine release can be increased from presynaptic membranes by increasing calcium ion influx.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
