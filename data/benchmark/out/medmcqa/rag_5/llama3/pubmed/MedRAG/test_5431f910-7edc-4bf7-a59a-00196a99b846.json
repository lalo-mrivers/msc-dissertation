["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the risk of endocarditis, which is a type of infection that can occur on valves or other structures in the heart. The lesions listed are all potential sites for valve problems, but one may be less likely to have an increased risk of endocarditis. Let's review the documents: Long-term complications of native valve infective endocarditis in non-addicts shows that aortic valve involvement is associated with the need for late surgery. Clinical relevance of vegetations in infective endocarditis suggests that detection of vegetations on initial echocardiogram identifies a subgroup at risk for complications, more so if vegetations are present on the aortic valve. Bacterial endocarditis: an analysis of factors affecting long-term survival doesn't provide specific information about the lesions listed. However, [Infective endocarditis] mentions that IE involving the right side of the heart is increasing due to instrumental procedures and drug-addiction, but it's not directly related to the question.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
