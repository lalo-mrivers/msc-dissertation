["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents mention the concept of 'guiding planes' or 'guidance' in various contexts. In the first document, it is mentioned that a device provides an accurate anticipation of the needle path by external radiopaque landmarks, implying that guiding planes help in CT-guided biopsies. Similarly, in the third document, three-dimensional echocardiography uses line-of-intersection guidance to improve image positioning. This suggests that guiding planes can aid in imaging procedures. Furthermore, the concept of cellular guidance in the second document highlights the importance of guiding planes in understanding biological processes.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
