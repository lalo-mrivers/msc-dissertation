["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The provided documents mainly discuss attentional inhibition mechanisms, electrical interference, and masticatory movements. The paper 'Changes in mandibular masticatory movements after insertion of nonworking-side interference' seems to be the most relevant to this question. It investigates how a non-working side interference affects masticatory movements and suggests that individual responses vary, but some movement variables are significantly changed initially, and then adaptation occurs at the end of the experimental period.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
