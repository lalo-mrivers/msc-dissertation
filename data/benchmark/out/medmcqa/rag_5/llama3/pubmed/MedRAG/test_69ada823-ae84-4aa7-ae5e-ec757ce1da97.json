["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the most appropriate treatment for a mandibular angle fracture. From the provided documents, we can see that there are studies on various types of fractures, including complicated mandibular fractures and pediatric mandibular fractures. One study mentions that all infections were in fractures associated with teeth; none occurred in fractures fixed within 24 hours of injury. This suggests that timely treatment may reduce the risk of infection. Another study discusses the use of self-compression plates for various mandibular fractures, including initially infected fractures.\n\nConsidering this information, we can focus on the options that involve plate fixation. Option C, Compression plates, is not directly related to angle fractures. Options A and B both mention mini plates, but they are different in their placement (oblique ridge vs lateral surface of mandible). Option D, Reconstruction plates, is not specifically mentioned in the provided documents.\n\nGiven the information on timely treatment reducing infection risk and the use of compression plates for initially infected fractures, we can consider options A and B. However, option C's focus on compression plates rather than angle fractures makes it less relevant to this specific question.\n\nBased on the available information, option B, 2 mini plates on lateral surface of mandible, is the most appropriate treatment for a mandibular angle fracture.\", \"answer_choice\": B}"]
