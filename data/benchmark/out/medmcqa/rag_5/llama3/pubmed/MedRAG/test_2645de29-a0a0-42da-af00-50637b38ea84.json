["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The provided documents discuss the mechanisms of pain perception and transmission. The question asks about short sharp pain transmitted to brain by a specific type of fibers. The document 'Oral--facial pain: old puzzles, new postulates' explains that pain results from activation of small-diameter myelinated and unmyelinated afferent nerve fibres that innervate skin, mucosa, teeth etc. These fibres include A delta and C fibres. Since the document 'Brain evoked potentials are functional correlates of induced pain in man' does not provide specific information about tooth pulp-driven neurons, we can focus on the other documents. The document 'Tooth pulp-driven neurons in somatosensory cortex of primates: role in pain mechanisms including a review of the literature' discusses the stimulation of the tooth pulp and the response of neurons in the cerebral cortex. This suggests that A delta fibres are responsible for transmitting pain signals from the tooth to the brain, as they are specifically mentioned as being involved in pain mechanisms.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
