["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to the provided documents, we need to identify the specific situations that strongly indicate or are an absolute indication for open reduction of condylar fractures. From Mandibular fractures: a review of 156 consecutive cases, we know that closed reduction techniques were used as the primary treatment method, and open reduction was reserved for specific reasons (tabulated). Similarly, in Plate and screw fixation of selected condylar fractures of the mandible, open reduction with plate and screw fixation was used for subcondylar fractures. The document Surgical versus conservative treatment of unilateral condylar process fractures: clinical and radiographic evaluation of 80 patients suggests that surgical treatment is indicated when ideal anatomical reduction is not achievable through conservative methods. Lastly, in [Recent injuries of the femoral condyles (author's transl)], there is no specific information about indications for open reduction. Based on this analysis, we can conclude that...\",\n\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
