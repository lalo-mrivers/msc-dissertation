["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about condylar fracture dysarthrosis. Based on the provided documents, I found that mandibular condylar fractures are discussed in several articles. One of the articles mentioned transoral resection of a condylar osteochondroma, which is a rare case of a condylar fracture. The article does not mention anything about dysarthrosis. However, one of the other documents discusses Treating a mandibular condylar fracture in a patient with Huntington's disease. This article highlights the importance of open reduction and fixation of an intracapsular mandibular condylar fracture. It mentions that early function elimination of intermaxillary fixation benefited the patient. Therefore, it is possible to conclude that dysarthrosis could refer to disturbance of both anatomy as well as function.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
