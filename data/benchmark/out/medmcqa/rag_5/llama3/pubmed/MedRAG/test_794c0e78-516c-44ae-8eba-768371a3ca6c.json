["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To find the angle subtended by the largest letter in the Snellen chart on a person's eye who is reading it from a distance of 6 meters, we need to consider that the routine measurement range can be extended by moving test charts normally used at 20 ft to a closer distance; 1 m is recommended. This means that the visual acuity score should be calculated for all distances. Since inches and J numbers make visual acuity calculations impossible, but adopting metric measurements makes calculations far easier, we will use the metric system. According to the Type-size variability for near-point acuity tests, the results are expressed in the M notation (1 mm of letter height equals 0.7 M). We can use this information to calculate the angle subtended by the largest letter.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
