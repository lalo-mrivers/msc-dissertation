["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the given documents, I see that a study was carried out to determine the depth and width of posterior palatal seals. This suggests that the function of the posterior palatal seal is related to its measurement and purpose. Another document describes a method for correcting the posterior palatal seal area of a maxillary denture, which implies that the seal plays a role in retaining the denture. The other documents describe surgical techniques for closing palatal defects or fistulas, but they do not mention the function of the posterior palatal seal directly. Therefore, I conclude that the posterior palatal seal is likely involved in retention of the maxillary denture.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
