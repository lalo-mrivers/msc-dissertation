["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"When 2 screening tests are done in series, the first test is used to screen out people who are definitely not sick. Then, the second test is applied only to those who have already tested positive for the first test. This means that the specificity of the first test is what matters most, as it needs to be high enough to rule out false positives. The sensitivity of the second test also becomes more important because it only tests people who have already been identified as possibly having the disease. Therefore, we would expect increased sensitivity and decreased specificity from the combination of these two tests.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
