["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the contraction mechanism of skeletal muscles. The provided documents discuss muscle plasticity, architecture, control demands, activity patterns, and metabolism. Since we are asked to choose from options related to muscle contraction, we can focus on the biochemical changes occurring within muscle fibres whose contractile properties have been modified by altered motor innervation. This suggests that the answer is not directly related to calcium binding or actin and myosin filaments shortening. Therefore, we should look for a mechanism that initiates contraction without involving calcium binding to tropomyosin or troponin. The provided options do not explicitly state the initiation of contraction, but the description of muscle fibre contractile machinery can be related to the mechanism of muscle contraction. Based on this reasoning, we can eliminate options A and D as they are directly related to calcium binding. Option B is also eliminated because it focuses on actin and myosin filaments shortening, which does not initiate contraction. Therefore, the answer should be based on the remaining option C.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
