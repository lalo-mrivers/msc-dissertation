["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the most common functional tumors of endocrine pancreas. I will go through the provided documents to find relevant information on functioning endocrine pancreatic tumors. One of the documents talks about the pathology and cell biology of endocrine pancreatic tumors, which states that all these tumors are 'functioning' in the sense that they elaborate hormones that cause more or less conspicuous clinical syndromes. This suggests that functioning endocrine pancreatic tumors produce hormones that can be identified clinically. Another document discusses various types of islet cell tumors, including functioning and non-functioning ones. However, it does not provide information on which type of functioning tumor is the most common. Lastly, none of the other documents provided seem to have relevant information on this topic.\n\nBased on the provided information, I will consider the answer choices for functional endocrine pancreatic tumors. The choices are Vipoma, Gastrinoma, Glucagonoma, and Somatostatinoma. None of these options seem to be supported by the provided documents as being the most common functional tumor type. However, it is important to note that the term 'functioning' in this context likely refers to tumors that produce clinically apparent hormones. This would suggest that one of the choices, if not all, could be considered a functioning tumor.\n\nGiven the lack of concrete information and considering the context of the question, I will choose an answer based on my general knowledge of endocrine pancreatic tumors. Glucagonoma is a type of functioning islet cell tumor that produces glucagon, which can cause hyperglycemia and other symptoms. Gastrinoma is another functioning islet cell tumor that produces gastrin, which can cause Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. Vipoma and Somatostatinoma are also functioning islet cell tumors that produce VIP and somatostatin, respectively.\n\nBased on my knowledge of endocrine pancreatic tumors, I believe that Gastrinoma might be a common functional tumor type due to its ability to cause the symptoms of Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. This would suggest that it could potentially be diagnosed clinically through the identification of gastrin-related symptoms.\n\nIn conclusion, while the provided documents do not explicitly state which functioning endocrine pancreatic tumor is the most common, my knowledge and consideration of the answer choices lead me to believe that Gastrinoma might be a good option.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
