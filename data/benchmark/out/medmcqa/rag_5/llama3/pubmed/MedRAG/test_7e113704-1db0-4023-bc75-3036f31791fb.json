["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents provide information about arch length analysis, dental attrition, and changes in the dental arch during the changing dentition. The question states that an arch length analysis shows a discrepancy of more than 10 mm. This suggests that there is a significant difference between the ideal arch form and the actual arch length. Based on this information, it can be inferred that the discrepancy is likely due to tooth-to-arch-length discrepancies mentioned in 'Accurate arch-discrepancy measurements'.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
