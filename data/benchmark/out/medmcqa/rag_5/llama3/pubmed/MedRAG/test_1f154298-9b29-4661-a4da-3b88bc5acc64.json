["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The β-oxidation of odd-chain fatty acids involves the metabolism of 5-enoyl-CoAs. According to the studies on NADPH-dependent beta-oxidation of unsaturated fatty acids with double bonds extending from odd-numbered carbon atoms, the mitochondrial metabolism of 5-enoyl-CoAs leads to the formation of 2-trans-4-trans-octadienoyl-CoA which is then chain-shortened to hexanoyl-CoA, butyryl-CoA, and acetyl-CoA. Therefore, the β-oxidation of odd-chain fatty acids produces Acetyl CoA.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
