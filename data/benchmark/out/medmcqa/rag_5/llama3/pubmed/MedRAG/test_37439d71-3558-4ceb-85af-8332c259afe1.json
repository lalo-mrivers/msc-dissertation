["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, we need to determine the presence of acid-base abnormality. The patient has a pH of 7.40 which is slightly alkalotic. This suggests metabolic alkalosis. Next, we need to look at the anion gap. The HCO3 is 25 and pCO2 is 40, indicating that the anion gap is high. Therefore, we have high anion gap metabolic acidosis with metabolic alkalosis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
