["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents discuss the effects of aging on the periodontal ligament. According to 'Considerations on the contribution of ageing to loss of periodontal tissue support', age-related changes manifest as loss of probing attachment and alveolar bone. However, it is noted that a high proportion of tooth surfaces remain with no attachment or alveolar bone loss in ages between 20-64 years. This suggests that aging changes may not inevitably be manifested as loss of periodontal tissue support. In 'Remodelling of collagen fibers in the periodontal ligament and the supra-alveolar region', it is mentioned that the rate of turnover of collagen in the periodontal ligament may be somewhat higher than in the gingiva, but this does not provide information about changes in the number of cells or collagen fibers with aging. Therefore, the answer must be based on the general concept of aging and its effects on the periodontal ligament.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A: Decrease in number of cells and increase in collagen fibers\"}"]
