["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, it is clear that vertical transmission of HIV from mother to child is a significant concern. The timing of transmission is uncertain, with some data suggesting that intrauterine exposure poses the greatest risk, while others suggest that infection could occur at or around the time of delivery. To prevent transmission, identifying HIV-infected women and understanding how and when the virus infects the fetus are crucial steps. Resources should be set aside for routine screening for HIV in antenatal women, and new techniques designed to detect neonatal HIV infection must be properly evaluated against standard methods. The documents also highlight the importance of quantifying the contribution made by intrauterine versus intrapartum events.
