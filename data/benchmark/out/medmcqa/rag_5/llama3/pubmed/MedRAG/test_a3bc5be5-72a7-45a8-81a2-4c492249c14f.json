["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the host tissue response in acute inflammation. Acute inflammation is characterized by an immediate and intense response to injury or infection. According to the provided documents, the morphological patterns of inflammation can appear depending on the character and intensity of the injury. The histopathology of acute and chronic inflammation describes the different types of inflammation that can occur, including exudative, necrotizing, granulomatous, and cytopathic.\n\nThe document on 'Metabolic response to infection' provides insight into the complex array of metabolic responses within the host during an infectious process. This includes the production of acute phase reactant serum proteins like C-reactive protein (CRP), which binds selectively to T lymphocytes.\n\nThe document on 'Tissue-specific regulation of inflammation' highlights the importance of complement proteins in the inflammatory response and their regulation by mechanisms similar to those that regulate other 'acute phase reactants'.\n\nThe document on 'Inflammatory host responses in sepsis' considers the various cellular as well as humoral mediators involved in the host's response during sepsis.\n\nConsidering these documents, we can conclude that acute inflammation is characterized by an exudative response, which includes an increase in permeability of blood vessels and the migration of white blood cells into the affected area. This response is necessary for the removal of pathogens or injured tissue.\n\nThe other options (necrotizing, granulomatous, and cytopathic) may occur in chronic inflammation or specific types of infections, but they are not characteristic of acute inflammation per se.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
