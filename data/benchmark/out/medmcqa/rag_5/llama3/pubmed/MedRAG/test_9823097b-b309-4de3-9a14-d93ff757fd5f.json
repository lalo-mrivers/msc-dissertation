["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about a reflex that never disappears. Based on the provided documents, there are mentions of various types of reflexes, such as acoustic reflex, stapedius reflex, and H reflex. However, none of these reflexes are mentioned as being persistent or never disappearing. On the other hand, neurologists are concerned with elicitation and interpretation of reflexes as indicative of levels of nervous system development or dissolution. This suggests that reflexes may change or adapt over time, but do not necessarily 'disappear'. Therefore, the answer is likely to be a reflex that is not explicitly mentioned in the provided documents.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
