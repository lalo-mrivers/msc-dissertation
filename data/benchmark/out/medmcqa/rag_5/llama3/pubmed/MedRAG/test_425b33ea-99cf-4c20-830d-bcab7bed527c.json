["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about enzymes elevated in plasma in MI. We need to look for relevant information in the given documents. The first document talks about CPK isoenzymes and mentions that MB isoenzyme is specific to injured myocardium. The second document states that MB isoenzyme of creatine phosphokinase has provided a way out of the difficulty of diagnosing myocardial infarction. The third document mentions that creatine phosphokinase appears to be the most useful of the conventional enzymes employed in the diagnosis of myocardial infarction, but limitations due to technical factors and other clinical states causing elevation must be recognized. This suggests that CPK is an enzyme elevated in plasma during MI. The fourth document talks about glyceraldehyde-phosphate dehydrogenase activity in serum and mentions that creatine kinase and lactate dehydrogenase activities are useful indicators of myocardial infarction. However, it does not mention CPK-MB specifically being elevated in plasma. Therefore, we can infer that CPK-MB is an enzyme elevated in plasma during MI.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
