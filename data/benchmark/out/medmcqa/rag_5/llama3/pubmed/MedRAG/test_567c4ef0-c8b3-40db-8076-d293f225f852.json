["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks for characteristic features of Tricuspid Atresia. From the provided documents, we can identify that tricuspid atresia is associated with right ventricular hypoplasia, which is mentioned in 'Tricuspid atresia: corrective operation without a bioprosthetic valve.' and 'Anatomic variations in underdeveloped right ventricle related to tricuspid atresia and stenosis.' Pulmonary vascularity is not specifically mentioned as diminished. Left axis deviation is not a characteristic feature of Tricuspid Atresia, but rather an ECG finding commonly seen with truncus arteriosus (mentioned in 'Tricuspid atresia: association with persistent truncus arteriosus'). Splitting of S2 is not a specific feature of tricuspid atresia.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
