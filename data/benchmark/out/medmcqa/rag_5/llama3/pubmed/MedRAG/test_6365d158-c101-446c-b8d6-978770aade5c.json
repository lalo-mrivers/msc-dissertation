["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Anatomical study of the root apex in the maxillary anterior teeth is discussed, which provides information on the apical constriction and the apical foramen. According to this study, the labiolingual diameter of the root canal at the apical constriction of central incisors, lateral incisors, and cuspids averaged 0.425 mm, 0.369 mm, and 0.375 mm, respectively; and the respective vertical distances between apex and apical constriction were 0.863 mm, 0.825 mm, and 1.010 mm. This information allows for a comparison of these values with the question asking about the distance between the apical constriction and the apical foramen.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
