["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the provided documents, we can see that rheumatoid arthritis is characterized by inflammation. In 'The management of inflammation in rheumatic diseases', it's mentioned that the clinical response and side-effects of drugs used to control inflammation provide clues about their mode of action. In 'General mechanisms of inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis', it's explained that there are two major types of immunologically-induced inflammation, which occur concurrently in the same joint. This suggests that inflammation is a key feature of rheumatoid arthritis.
