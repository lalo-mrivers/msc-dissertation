["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking which amino acid does not undergo post-translational modification. We can look at the provided documents to find the answer. In 'Posttranslational covalent modification of proteins', it is mentioned that about 140 amino acids and amino acid derivatives have been identified as constituents of different proteins in different organisms, suggesting that many amino acids undergo post-translational modifications. However, we are looking for a specific amino acid that does not include post-translational modification. We can then look at the options provided: A, B, C, and D. Selenocysteine is an amino acid that is incorporated into proteins through translation and not modified post-translationally (according to 'Posttranslational covalent modification of proteins'). Triiodothyronine is a hormone and not an amino acid. Hydroxyproline and hydroxylysine are both examples of amino acids that undergo post-translational modifications.\",\n\"answer_choice\": A"]
