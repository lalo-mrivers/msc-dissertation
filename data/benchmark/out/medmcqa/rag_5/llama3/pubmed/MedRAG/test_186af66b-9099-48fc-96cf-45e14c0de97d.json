["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the provided documents, it is evident that children with cleft lip and palate have a reduction of the nasopharyngeal bony framework, which is consistent with the reduction of the size of the bony nasopharynx. The height of the body of the sphenoid bone was reduced, but the angle of the cranial base was within normal limits. This suggests that maxillary growth may be affected by enlarged adenoids. Furthermore, another study found a direct correlation between adenoidal enlargement and clinical signs and symptoms, including nasal blockage and increased secretory otitis media.
