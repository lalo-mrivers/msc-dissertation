["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The case study provided describes a 53-year-old female patient who developed trismus after external extraction of 38 acutely inflammed teeth. The phlegmon tracked retropharyngeally and settled on the opposite side, causing difficulty in estimating the amount of tissue area affected by the abscessed phlegmon due to severe trismus. A lateral radiograph of the neck showed that the lower part of the prevertebral soft-part shadow was considerably wider than normal, indicating that the inflammation had tracked retropharyngeally and inferiorly. The life-threatening infection healed after the abscess was incised and drained externally. The patient's condition is related to oral surgery, specifically dental extraction, which suggests that trismus may be a complication of this procedure. The use of corticosteroids in oral surgery is also discussed, highlighting their potential benefits in reducing postoperative complications such as edema and trismus.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
