["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about hand to knee gait in polio. Polio is a condition that affects muscles. The relevant documents describe post-polio syndrome, which typically occurs 20-40 years after an acute episode of poliomyelitis and is confined to previously affected muscles.
