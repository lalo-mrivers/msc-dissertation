["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the definition of pressure in the vascular system when there is no blood flow. According to the documents, when tissues are surrounded by non-compliant fascia and tissue pressures rise above intracapillary pressure, soft-walled capillaries can passively collapse. This suggests that the pressure in the vascular system in the absence of blood flow may be related to the transmural pressure or mean circulatory filling pressure. However, it's not explicitly stated in the documents which one defines the pressure in the absence of blood flow.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
