["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents provide information on dental materials, dentin properties, and bonding techniques. In the study [Thermic behavior of dental enamel, dentin and selected dental materials], it is mentioned that the linear coefficient of expansion of dentin is estimated by means of holographic-interferometric measurements. This suggests that the thermal conductivity of dentin is well-documented in this study. Comparing the results with those on composite resins and other materials can help identify which material's thermal conductivity is close to that of dentin.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
