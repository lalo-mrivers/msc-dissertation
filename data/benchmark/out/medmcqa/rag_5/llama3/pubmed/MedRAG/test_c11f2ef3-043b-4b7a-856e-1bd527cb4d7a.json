["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with pain in bilateral preauricular region and deviation of the mandible to right side on mouth opening. This suggests that there might be a problem with the jaw or the surrounding area. The relevant documents suggest oral ulceration is a common problem, but it does not seem related to this presentation. Oral hypoglycaemic agents do not seem to play a role in this scenario either. The paper on glucagon and glucose tolerance does not provide any relevant information for this case. The document on trismus or limited mandibular opening seems more relevant as it discusses various methods used in determining the limitation of mouth opening. Given that there is deviation of the mandible to right side on mouth opening, it suggests a possible fracture or dislocation of one or both condyles. Fracture of left condyle and Dislocation of left condyle can be ruled out based on the deviation of the mandible to right side.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
