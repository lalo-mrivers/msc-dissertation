["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about a yellowish white soft sticky deposit loosely adherent on tooth surface. The first thing to consider is the type of substance that could be described as 'soft' and 'sticky'. The documents suggest that a possible factor affecting adhesion to mineralized tissues is the physicochemical structure of the adherents, which might imply that the substance in question has some kind of chemical properties. Considering the similarity of chemical bonds in substrate and adhesive which favours adhesion, it's likely that the substance is a type of material that can form chemical bonds with the tooth surface. The term 'materia alba' comes to mind as a possible answer because it refers to a white or yellowish-white soft sticky deposit found on tooth surfaces.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
