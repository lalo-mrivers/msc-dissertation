["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome is described with macroglossia, exomphalos, and gigantism. Macroglossia is a common feature of this syndrome. Fanconi's anaemia is also discussed, but there is no mention of skull abnormalities related to this condition. Therefore, we need to focus on the Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome documentation. In 'Macroglossia in the Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome', there is no mention of any skull deformities. In 'Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome in a mother and her son', we don't find any information about skull abnormalities either.

Therefore, we can conclude that there is no information available about the type of skull seen in Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome and Fanconi's anaemia.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
