["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks for the direction that doesn't occur in 5' to 3' direction. DNA repair is a process that involves editing or removing errors from DNA, which can occur in both 5' to 3' and 3' to 5' directions. DNA replication occurs in the 5' to 3' direction as it requires the unwinding of DNA double helix and the synthesis of new strands. RNA editing also occurs in the 5' to 3' direction as it involves the modification of existing RNA sequences. Transcription, on the other hand, occurs from 3' to 5', where RNA polymerase adds nucleotides to a growing RNA chain.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
