["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"There are no relevant documents mentioning the cleaning of base metal alloy. However, we can look at documents related to dental implants and dentures for some guidance. The Side effects of immersion-type cleansers on the metal components of dentures document suggests that commercial bleaches and unbuffered hypochlorite solutions should not be used on dentures with metal components. This implies that strong acids like HCl or HF might not be suitable for cleaning base metal alloys. On the other hand, documents about corrosion resistance suggest that stainless steel implants are prone to tarnishing when exposed to certain chemicals. Considering this, it's possible that a mild acid like H2SO4 might be used for cleaning. Sandblasting with aluminum oxide seems unlikely as it would likely damage or disfigure the metal.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
