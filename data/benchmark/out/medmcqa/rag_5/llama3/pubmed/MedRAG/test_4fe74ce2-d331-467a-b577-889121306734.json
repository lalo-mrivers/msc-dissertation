["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks for the percentage of SSI rate in patients with a clean-contaminated wound. The relevant document is 'Wound infection in colonic surgery'. According to this document, there was a total of 7 wound infections, constituting an incidence of 2.1%. However, this was not specifically for clean-contaminated wounds. We need to look at another document. In 'Wound infections in general surgery', it is mentioned that rates of wound infection were studied in a clinic performing both clean and potentially contaminated surgeries. The study found that the rate of wound infection in potentially contaminated operations was 4.7%. Unfortunately, we do not have information on clean-contaminated wounds specifically.\n\nHowever, we can try to estimate the answer based on the given information. We know that potentially contaminated operations had a higher rate of wound infections compared to clean operations. Therefore, it is likely that the SSI rate in patients with clean-contaminated wounds would be somewhere between 2.1% (the overall SSI rate) and 4.7% (the SSI rate for potentially contaminated operations). Based on this reasoning, we can choose an answer.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
