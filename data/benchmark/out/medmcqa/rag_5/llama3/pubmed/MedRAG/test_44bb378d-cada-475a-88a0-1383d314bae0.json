["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about a tooth with deep caries on the occlusal surface and radiograph shows radiopaque mass at the apex of the tooth. The main focus should be on the radiopaque mass. From the provided documents, it seems that only one document mentions radiolucent area in the context of dental caries, which is 'Radiographic caries diagnosis and treatment decisions'. However, this does not mention anything about a radiopaque mass at the apex of the tooth. The other documents do not seem to be relevant to this question. Therefore, it seems that the only possible option related to the radiopaque mass is Condensing osteitis from document 'Managing occlusal surfaces of young permanent molars'.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
