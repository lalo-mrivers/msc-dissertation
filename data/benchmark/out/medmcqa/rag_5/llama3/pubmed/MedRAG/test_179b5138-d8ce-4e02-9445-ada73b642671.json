["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about a technique based on RNA. The given documents discuss various methods related to RNA, such as messenger ribonucleic acid synthesis, processing, and regulation, chemical synthesis of RNA, purification of RNA using an anti-RNA monoclonal antibody, use of in vitro-transcribed RNAs as immobilized targets during RNA:RNA hybridization, and differential display of eukaryotic messenger RNA by means of the polymerase chain reaction. Among these techniques, only PCR involves RNA directly.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
