["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the documents provided, I can see that the topic is related to dental composites and polymerization. The mention of benzoyl peroxide as an initiator in the 'New initiator systems for dental resins based on ascorbic acid' document suggests that it is used to initiate a chemical reaction. The temperature at which benzoyl peroxide forms free radicals during the polymerization of acrylic resin is not explicitly stated, but we can infer from the literature that this temperature is typically above room temperature (around 20-25Â°C). However, the exact temperature range for the formation of free radicals by benzoyl peroxide is not provided in the documents.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
