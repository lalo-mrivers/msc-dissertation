["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The cell membrane is freely permeable to ions X, Y, and Z. The equilibrium potentials of X and Y are -30mV and -40mV respectively at the resting membrane potential. This means that the resting membrane potential is closer to the equilibrium potential of X than Y. If a drug is infused that can block the permeability of Z, it will not affect the movement of ions X and Y. Since Z is blocked, its influence on the membrane potential will be eliminated. The membrane potential will remain at its resting state.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
