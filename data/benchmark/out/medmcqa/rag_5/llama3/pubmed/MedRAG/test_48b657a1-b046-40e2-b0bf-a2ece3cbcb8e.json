["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 32-year-old woman who has already had a child with Down's syndrome. Since she is less than 35 years old, the risk of Down's syndrome based on maternal age alone would be low. However, given her previous experience with having a child with Down's syndrome, it would be reasonable to perform further testing to determine the likelihood of having another child with Down's syndrome. The triple test (measurement of three substances in maternal serum combined with maternal age) is an option but it may not provide accurate results at 9 weeks gestation. Therefore, I would recommend a blood test that measures maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein (MSAFP) to assess the risk of having another child with Down's syndrome.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
