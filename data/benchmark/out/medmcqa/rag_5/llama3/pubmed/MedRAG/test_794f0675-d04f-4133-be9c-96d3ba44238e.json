["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for an indication that is NOT for antibiotic therapy. Reviewing the documents, we can see that pyogenic hepatic abscesses are often treated with antibiotics, but also require percutaneous drainage or surgical treatment. Brain abscess analysis suggests radical excision or drainage as a first stage of treatment. Incidence, outcome, and proposed management of isolated abscesses complicating acute left-sided colonic diverticulitis indicates that mesocolic abscesses can usually be managed conservatively without drainage. Early appearance of abscess after biliary operation mentions fever as a symptom rather than an indication for antibiotic therapy. Regional lymphadenopathy is not mentioned in the context of abscess treatment. Horizontal bone loss and deep inaccessible pocket are unlikely to be related to acute abscess, making them less likely indications for antibiotic therapy. Therefore, we can conclude that regional lymphadenopathy is NOT an indication for antibiotic therapy.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
