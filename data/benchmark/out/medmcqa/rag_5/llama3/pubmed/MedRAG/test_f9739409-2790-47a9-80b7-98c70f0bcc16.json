["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with hand wringing stereotype movements, impaired language and communication development, breath holding spells, poor social skills, and deceleration of head growth after 6 months of age. The paper 'A guide to differentiated developmental diagnosis with a case demonstrating its use' discusses the concept of persistence of normal functioning as reflected in the attitudes, feelings, and behavior of primary school children. This suggests that the patient's current functioning is related to their present development. The patient's language and communication development are impaired, which is supported by the paper 'The poor-communicating two-year-old and his family' stating a statistically significant correlation between delayed language development in a two-year-old and evidence of psychosocial deprivation in his/her family.\n\nThe patient's breath holding spells may be related to their deceleration of head growth after 6 months of age. The paper 'Hemi-hydranencephaly with favourable outcome' discusses the rare anomaly of hemihydranencephaly, which can have a mild impact on psychomotor development.\n\nThe patient's features do not fit the typical pattern of normal development nor are they similar to an adult-oriented frame of reference. Considering these factors, the most likely diagnosis is Rett's syndrome, as it is characterized by deceleration of head growth after 6 months of age and impaired language and communication development.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
