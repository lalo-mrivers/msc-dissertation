["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the use of formalin as a fixative in biopsy. According to the provided documents, we know that formaldehyde solutions are commonly used in neuropathology and histopathology. We also know that the concentration of formaldehyde can affect the degree of shrinkage during fixation. The study on shrinkage of brain during histological procedures with fixation in formaldehyde solutions of different concentrations showed that there was no significant difference between the three groups, including 4% buffered solution, 10%, and 12% solutions without additives. This suggests that the concentration of formaldehyde used in biopsy can affect the degree of shrinkage. However, it does not provide any information about the other properties of formalin as a fixative mentioned in the options.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
