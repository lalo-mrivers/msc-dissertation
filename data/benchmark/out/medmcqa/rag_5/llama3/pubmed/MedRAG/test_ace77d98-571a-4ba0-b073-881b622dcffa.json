["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the bones that form the inferior wall of the orbit. The relevant documents describe various anatomical details about the orbit, including its walls. One document (Margins of safety in lateral orbitotomy) mentions measurements taken of the anterior vertical opening, anteroposterior opening, and distance to the middle cranial fossa, which helps understand the anatomy of the orbital wall. Another document (Subtotal reconstruction of the orbit after destruction by benign tumour) describes the technique for reconstructing the orbital walls after destruction by tumors. The documents do not provide a specific description of the inferior wall of the orbit or its constituent bones.\", \n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
