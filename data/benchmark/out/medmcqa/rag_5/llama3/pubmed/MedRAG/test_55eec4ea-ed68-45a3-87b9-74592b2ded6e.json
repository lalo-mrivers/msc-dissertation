["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the inter dose interval, which is the time between doses. The relevant documents mention cytarabine and etoposide, but they don't provide direct information on the inter dose interval. However, one of the documents mentions that a constant duration of the dosing interval yields higher survival rates in mice treated by cytarabine, as compared with random dosing intervals. This suggests that the inter dose interval may be related to the duration of the dosing interval. Furthermore, another document mentions that fractionation of a daily 100-mg etoposide dose does not appear useful. This implies that the inter dose interval may be related to the total dose and not just the dose rate.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
