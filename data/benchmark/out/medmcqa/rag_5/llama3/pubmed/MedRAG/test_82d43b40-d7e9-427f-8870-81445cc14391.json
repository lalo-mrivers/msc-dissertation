["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the given documents, it can be seen that the Foramen spinosum is mentioned as one of the foramina reviewed in 'Surgical anatomy of the pterygopalatine fossa' and 'The morphological analysis of human canalis infraorbitalis and foramen infraorbitale'. The text states that 'the position of the several foramina is reviewed also', which implies that all the foramina mentioned, including Foramen spinosum, are being discussed. This information does not provide direct comparison between the posterior location of these foramina, but it gives an idea about their relative positions in general terms.\n\nThe other options (Foramen rotundum and Foramen ovale) are also mentioned as part of the pterygopalatine fossa's surgical anatomy, which suggests that they are located anterior to Foramen spinosum. This information is not directly stating the posterior position of Foramen spinosum but rather comparing it with other foramina in terms of their relative locations.\n\nIn conclusion, considering all the given documents and the provided question, it can be inferred that among the options mentioned, Foramen spinosum is the most posteriorly present.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
