["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about features that are suggestive of asbestosis. According to the documents, asbestosis is a condition that may have a latent period of more than 20 years from exposure to appearance of clinical or roentgenologic evidence. This means it does not occur within five years of exposure (Option A). The documents also state that biopsy should be avoided if the chest radiograph shows no evidence of asbestosis, suggesting that the disease progresses even after removal of contact with asbestos. Additionally, asbestosis can lead to pleural mesothelioma and the presence of asbestos bodies in sputum is a feature of this condition. Therefore, all options except one are suggestive of asbestosis.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
