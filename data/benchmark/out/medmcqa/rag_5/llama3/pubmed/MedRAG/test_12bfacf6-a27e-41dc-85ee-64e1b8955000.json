["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about determining the driver based on autopsy findings. None of the options provided (whiplash injury, steering wheel imprint, sparrow foot marks, or seat belt abrasion over left shoulder) are directly related to determining the driver. Sparrow foot marks and steering wheel imprint seem unrelated to this scenario altogether. Whiplash injury could be due to a passenger, not necessarily the driver. Seat belt abrasion could be due to either the driver or passenger. Therefore, it seems that the correct answer would be one of the features that directly relate to driving.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
