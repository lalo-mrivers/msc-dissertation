["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, we can infer that lowering serum lipid levels through nutritional changes is recommended for reducing the risk of coronary heart disease (CHD). The document 'Preventive trials and the \"diet-heart\" question' states that people should be advised to reduce their intake of foods high in saturated fats and replace them with foods relatively high in polyunsaturated fats. This will lower both total fat and dietary cholesterol intakes, and change the ratio of polyunsaturated to saturated fats.\n\nThe document 'Dietary recommendations for the community towards the postponement of coronary heart disease' also recommends reducing the intake of foods that are high in saturated fats and replacing them with foods relatively high in polyunsaturated fats. This will lower both total fat and dietary cholesterol intakes, and change the ratio of polyunsaturated to saturated fats.\n\nThe document 'Cholesterol and coronary disease--outstanding questions' states that a high dietary intake of saturated fat is a leading cause of coronary disease, and reduction of hypercholesterolemia in middle-aged males reduces CHD incidence. This suggests that reducing saturated fat intake may be an effective way to reduce the risk of CHD.\n\nThe document 'Diet and coronary heart disease' also recommends reducing the intake of fat (also cholesterol) with an increase in polyunsaturated moiety, and controlling obesity for the primary and secondary dietary prevention of CHD. This suggests that a diet low in saturated fats and high in polyunsaturated fats may be beneficial for reducing the risk of CHD.\n\nBased on these documents, it can be inferred that lowering LDL cholesterol levels is not specifically mentioned as a dietary goal for avoiding coronary artery disease. However, reducing saturated fat intake and increasing polyunsaturated fat intake are recommended as ways to lower both total fat and dietary cholesterol intakes, which may help reduce the risk of CHD.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B: Saturated fat <7% of total calories.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
