["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to the documents, the PCL (Posterior Cruciate Ligament) is a ligament that runs from the femoral condyle to the tibia. It's mentioned in 'Knee dislocations with intact PCL' that significant soft tissue and ligamentous damage usually result from complete knee dislocation. In 'Complete knee dislocation without posterior cruciate ligament disruption', it's stated that the PCL may occasionally be spared significant injury in anterior type dislocations, thus favorably affecting treatment options. Additionally, in 'Posterior cruciate ligament injuries', it's mentioned that the PCL reconstruction is not often necessary and that the arthroscopic procedure is exacting and technically demanding.\n\nFrom these documents, we can conclude that the PCL is a ligament that plays an important role in knee joint stability, particularly during hyperextension. It's also important to note that the PCL may be injured or spared depending on the type of dislocation.\n\nBased on this information, none of the answer choices (A-D) are entirely accurate. The PCL is not an extra synol structure (A), nor is it a primary restraint for post-dislocation of knee joint (B). It's also not a primary restrain for internal rotation around knee joint (C). And finally, it's not attached to the medial femoral condyle (D).\n\nTherefore, all answer choices are false.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
