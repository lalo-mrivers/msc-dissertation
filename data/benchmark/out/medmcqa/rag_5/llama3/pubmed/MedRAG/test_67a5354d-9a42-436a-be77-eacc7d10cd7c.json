["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the differentiation between enamel hatchet and chisel. The provided documents are related to enamel, but there is no specific information about the shape or size of a hatchet or chisel. Therefore, we need to rely on general knowledge or external sources to answer this question. Let's analyze each option: A, curved in one plane only; B, blade is larger; C, blade is perpendicular to the long axis of handle; D, blade is heavier. Based on our understanding of hatchets and chisels, we can eliminate options B, D, as they are not relevant characteristics for differentiating between enamel hatchet and chisel. Option A seems more plausible, but without specific information about the shape or size of an enamel hatchet, it's difficult to confirm this option. Therefore, we need to rely on external sources or general knowledge.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
