["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the rise of blood flow if the radius of blood vessels is increased by 50%. This problem can be solved using the principles of fluid dynamics and physiology of the cardiovascular system. From the document 'Shear forces and blood vessel radii in the cardiovascular system', we know that blood vessel radii are governed by mathematical or physiological principles that govern the radii of blood vessels in the cardiovascular system. According to this principle, an increase in radius leads to a proportional increase in flow. Since the radius is increased by 50%, the flow should also be increased by 50%. Therefore, the rise of blood flow if the radius of blood vessels is increased by 50% is equal to the original flow.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
