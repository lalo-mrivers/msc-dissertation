["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, we can infer that elastomeric impression materials are carried in a custom tray. This is mentioned in the document 'Some parameters for testing deformation of elastomeric impression materials' which states: \\\"In a custom tray with light and heavy viscosity materials, the syringe material layer was only 0-0.15 mm thick...\\\". Since this document specifically mentions custom trays, it implies that the elastomeric impression materials are carried in such trays.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
