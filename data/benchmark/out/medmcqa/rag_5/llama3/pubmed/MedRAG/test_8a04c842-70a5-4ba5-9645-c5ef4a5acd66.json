["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about normal dentition in centric occlusion. We can look at the documents for clues on what the opposing contact may be expected to be. In the document 'Occlusion and orthodontics', it is stated that 'There should be no buccolingual thrust or impact to any tooth on closure to contact in centric relation or to centric occlusion.' This suggests that there should be smooth-sliding occlusal contact movements without any interference. The document 'Pathophysiology of occlusal balance' talks about harmony at the anatomical median occlusal position as the prerequisite for a physiologically balanced occlusion. This implies that in normal dentition, opposing contact may be expected to occur where the anatomy allows for smooth-sliding occlusal contact movements.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
