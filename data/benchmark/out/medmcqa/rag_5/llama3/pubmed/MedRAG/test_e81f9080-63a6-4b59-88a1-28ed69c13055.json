["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant document is 'Mechanical transduction in the Golgi tendon organ: a hypothesis.' According to this document, force applied to a muscle's tendon will straighten collagen braids and cause compressional deformation of the axon branches trapped between them. This suggests that the Golgi tendon organ (GTO) functions as a biological force transducer under static loading conditions.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
