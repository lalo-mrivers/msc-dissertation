["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the role of ammonia in brain metabolism. In the first document, it is stated that at physiological concentrations of ammonia, glutamine synthesis appears to be limited by the rate of glutamate accumulation and the activity of competing reactions, not by the activity of glutamine synthetase. This suggests that ammonia plays a role in regulating glutamine synthesis. In the second document, it is mentioned that the brain levels of glutamine are significantly higher in patients with hepatic coma. The third document discusses the purine nucleotide cycle and its relation to ammonia production. Finally, the fourth document describes the removal of ammonium formed from the conversion of urea by alkalinization and subsequent removal of free ammonia. From these documents, it can be inferred that brain ammonia is removed as a gas (ammonia) through alkalinization.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
