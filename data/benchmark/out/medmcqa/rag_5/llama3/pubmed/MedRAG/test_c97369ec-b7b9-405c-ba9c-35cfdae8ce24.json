["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the maximum capacity of a Bakri balloon used in post-paum hemorrhage. The provided documents do not explicitly mention the Bakri balloon or its maximum capacity. However, the document 'Fatal pulmonary hemorrhage after use of the flow-directed balloon-tipped catheter' mentions the flow-directed balloon-tipped catheter, which is extensively used in intensive care units, catheterization laboratories, operating rooms, and emergency wards. The document 'Permanent control of massive tumor bleeding with intraluminal balloon catheters' also discusses the use of intraluminal balloon catheters for hemorrhage control.\n\nWhile there is no direct mention of the Bakri balloon or its maximum capacity, the documents suggest that balloons are used for hemorrhage control and have expansion capabilities from 1 mm to 6 cm. The question does not provide specific information about the Bakri balloon, so it's unclear what the correct answer would be based on the provided documents.\n\nTherefore, I will choose an answer based on my general knowledge of medical devices and procedures. Balloon catheters used in interventional angiography typically have a maximum capacity of 500 mL to 1000 mL, depending on their size and intended use. Based on this information, I will choose option D: 1000 mL as the most likely correct answer.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
