["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about a drug that acts on the cell wall of gram-positive bacteria. The provided documents describe the effects of antibiotics on bacterial cell walls. According to the documents, beta-lactam antibiotics inhibit cell-wall synthesis by binding to penicillin-binding proteins in the cytoplasmic membrane. Sulfonamides and trimethoprim also inhibit cell-wall synthesis. Vancomycin is specifically mentioned as an antibiotic that inhibits the biosynthesis of cell walls. Since gram-positive bacteria have a different cell wall composition compared to gram-negative bacteria, it is likely that vancomycin acts on the cell wall of gram-positive bacteria.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
