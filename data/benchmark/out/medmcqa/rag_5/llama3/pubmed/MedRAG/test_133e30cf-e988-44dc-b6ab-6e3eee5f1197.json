["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The article 'The structure and function of oral mucosa' states that the keratinized areas of the oral mucosa are least permeable. The nonkeratinized lining areas are most permeable. Since the question asks about the type of epithelium, we can refer to the article 'Diseases of the oral mucosa' which explains the functional morphology and biology of the oral mucosa. It states that the oral mucosa is stratified squamous. Therefore, based on this information, it seems likely that the correct answer is B: stratified squamous.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
