["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the earliest transient change following tissue injury. We can look at the provided documents for clues on what happens immediately after a fracture or trauma. The bone scan document mentions that 80% of all fractures were abnormal by 24 hours, and 95% by 72 hours after injury. This suggests that there is some sort of acute response to the injury, which is likely an inflammatory response. In this context, neutrophils are often the first type of white blood cell to arrive at the site of injury. Neutrophilia refers to an increase in neutrophil count, which can be seen as early as 24 hours after injury.\", \"answer_choice\": A}"]
