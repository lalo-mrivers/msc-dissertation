["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents discuss the migrating motor complex (MMC) in the gut. From 'Variability of migrating motor complex in humans', we know that the mean MMC cycling time varied significantly between subjects, with a range of 113-230 minutes.

Therefore, it is likely that the intervals at which MMCs reappear are not fixed and can vary depending on the individual.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C: 120 minutes\"\n}"]
