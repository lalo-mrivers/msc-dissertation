["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the conduction velocity of A-alpha fibers. In the provided documents, we can find information about the conduction velocities of different types of nerve fibers. The document 'Decremental conduction in a mammalian peripheral nerve' provides information on the conduction velocities of A-beta, A-delta, and C-fibers. According to this document, the conduction velocity of the A-beta component is 1.40 m/s per min at a conduction distance of 36 mm.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
