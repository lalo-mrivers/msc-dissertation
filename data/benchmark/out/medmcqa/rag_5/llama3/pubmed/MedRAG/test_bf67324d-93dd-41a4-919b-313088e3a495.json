["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents provided compare the use of bupivacaine HCL with lidocaine in oral surgery. Another document reviews the technique of intraligamentary anaesthesia and notes that buffered lidocaine stays effective for up to one week after preparation. There is also a review of local anesthesia in dentistry, highlighting advances made in past decades. Finally, there is a comparison of different local anesthetics and techniques used during therapeutic abortions. In none of these documents is it mentioned that lidocaine causes less depression of CNS or cardiovascular collapse, nor does it mention the potency of procaine compared to lidocaine. However, it does mention that buffered lidocaine stays effective for up to one week after preparation, which might imply that lidocaine has a longer shelf life. The same document notes that there is no statistically significant difference in extent or duration of anesthesia between the control and buffered solutions. This suggests that lidocaine does not cause less incidence of allergic reactions as this would likely be mentioned if it were the case.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
