["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about both ketogenic and glucogenic amino acids. Upon reviewing the relevant documents, I see that there are discussions of branched-chain amino acids, including valine, leucine, and isoleucine, as well as other amino acids like alanine, pyruvate, and glutamine.
