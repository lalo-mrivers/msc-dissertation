["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe various biopsy techniques, but none of them discuss the immediate placement of biopsy specimens after removal. The closest mention is in 'Role of the frozen tissue bank in molecular pathology' where it is mentioned that tissue sampling must be done as soon as possible after excision of the specimen and then snap frozen or frozen with cryoprotection for subsequent use in procedures requiring the extraction of genomic DNA, mRNA, or protein. This suggests that immediate freezing or preservation of the biopsy specimen is more important than immersion in a liquid.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
