["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents emphasize the importance of controlling malaria transmission rather than eradicating it completely. The first document mentions nonpharmacologic methods of prevention, which suggests that reducing incidence to zero might be a challenging goal. The second document explores the concept of drawing a distinction between malarial parasitization and disease, implying that control measures aim to reduce morbidity and mortality.
