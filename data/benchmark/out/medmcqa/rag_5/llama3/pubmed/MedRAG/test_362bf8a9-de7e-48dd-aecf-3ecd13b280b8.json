["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the classification of an orthodontic force that declines to zero between activations. The provided documents suggest that stress relaxation occurs over a period of 3 days in some orthodontic wires loaded initially to 20 kg (Tensile properties of orthodontic wire). This implies that the force may not be constant, but rather decreases or relaxes over time. Therefore, it is likely an intermittent force.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"]
