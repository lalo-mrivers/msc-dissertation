["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to the document 'Globin synthesis during erythroid cell maturation in alpha thalassemia', globin chain synthesis was examined in erythroid cells of increasing maturity, and it was found that in contrast to beta thalassemia, where a gradient of alpha/beta chain ratios increasing with erythroid cell maturation is observed, in alpha thalassemia the alpha/beta chain ratio remains constant throughout maturation. This suggests that there is no modification of the imbalance in globin chain synthesis either by increased alpha chain production or decreased beta chain synthesis in erythroid precursors.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
