["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about how hepcidin decreases iron absorption. Hepcidin is a hormone that regulates iron homeostasis by inhibiting iron absorption from the gut. In the provided documents, it is mentioned that in patients with primary haemochromatosis, there was inappropriately high uptake of iron by the biopsy specimens due to increased affinity for iron being present in the enterocyte (Uptake of iron by duodenal biopsy specimens). This suggests that hepcidin is not involved in this process. In idiopathic hemochromatosis, food iron absorption was studied and it was found that there was no correlation between chelatable iron and iron absorption (Iron absorption in normal subjects and patients with idiopathic haemochromatosis). Therefore, we can conclude that hepcidin's effect on iron absorption is not related to inhibition of transferrin or Divalent metal ion transporter. Hephaestin is a protein involved in ferroxidase activity, which is not directly related to hepcidin-mediated iron regulation.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
