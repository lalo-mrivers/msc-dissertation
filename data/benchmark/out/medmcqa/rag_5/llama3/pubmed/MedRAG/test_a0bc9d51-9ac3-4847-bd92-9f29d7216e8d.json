["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The provided documents describe various types of facial injuries and blindness without direct injury to the globe. The given scenario mentions a post-mortem body with one eye missing and some injury on mouth and nose, suggesting that the injury is related to the face. Considering the absence of the right eyeball and blood in the socket area, I think it is unlikely that the cause of the injury is blunt rupture to the eyeball or evisceration by a sharp weapon, as these injuries would not typically result in complete loss of an eye. Furthermore, post-mortem artifact can be ruled out as a possible cause since we are dealing with a traumatic injury of the face.
