["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents discuss the electrophysiological properties of the cochlea, including the endocochlear potential (EP). From the 'Electrophysiology of the cochlea' document, we can infer that the tectorial membrane is at zero potential. The 'Effects of 250 and 500 Hz tone exposure on the inner ear of guinea pigs as determined by electrophysiological techniques' document presents findings on EP changes in response to tone exposure. In this document, a pronounced decrease in the absolute value of the negative potential of the EP was observed.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C\n}"]
