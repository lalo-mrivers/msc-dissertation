["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks when hypotension occurs in hemorrhagic shock. The documents provided discuss the treatment of hemorrhagic shock, but they don't directly answer this question. However, we can infer that hypotension occurs with significant blood loss. For example, the first document discusses the effects of hypertonic saline therapy at different time points after bleeding starts, and it mentions a mean arterial pressure drop to 36 +/- 8 mm Hg and 56 +/- 9 mm Hg when hypertonic saline is infused 5 and 15 minutes after shock induction, respectively. This suggests that hypotension can occur with blood loss of around 30-40% or more.\n\nAnother document discusses fluid resuscitation following injury and the treatment of hemorrhagic shock. It emphasizes the importance of prompt fluid replacement to prevent complications resulting from prolonged inadequate tissue perfusion.\n\nThe last document provides a clinical analysis of cases of hemorrhagic shock and highlights the benefits of hemodilution in reducing blood loss and the need for blood transfusions. None of these documents provide a specific percentage range for when hypotension occurs, but they all suggest that significant blood loss is required to cause hypotension.\n\nGiven this information, we can infer that hypotension occurs with blood loss of at least 30-40% or more.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
