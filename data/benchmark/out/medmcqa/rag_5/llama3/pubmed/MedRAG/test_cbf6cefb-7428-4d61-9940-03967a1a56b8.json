["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Since we're dealing with an ECG having 'mean' axis of 90deg, which is a frontal-plane axis, we can infer that the maximum voltage of R wave would be seen in lead I. This is because the mean QRS vector and lead I are perpendicular to each other (since the angle between them is 90 degrees), resulting in the maximum amplitude.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
