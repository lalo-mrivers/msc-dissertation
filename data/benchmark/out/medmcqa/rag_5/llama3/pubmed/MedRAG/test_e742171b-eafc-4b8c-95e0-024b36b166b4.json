["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to the Schei ruler study, when measuring the amount of alveolar bone loss from radiographs, two sets of radiographs were taken of anterior and posterior segments after successive modification of the height of the alveolar bony crest. The heights were measured directly and also by means of the Schei ruler for each stage, using first the root length, and secondly, the total tooth length, as references for obtaining the percentage of remaining alveolar bone. No specific information is provided on subtracting from radiographic length. However, we can look at another study, 'Radiographic methods in the evaluation of periodontal therapy', which discusses radiographic analysis in clinical trials and subtraction radiography.\", \"answer_choice\": B}"]
