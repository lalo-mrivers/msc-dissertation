["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the first order neuron of the visual pathway. The relevant documents provide information on central mechanisms of vision, real and optimal neural images, sensitive and vulnerable periods in development of the visual system, functional visual streams, and a mathematical model for self-organization of orientation columns. The key to answering this question lies in understanding the processing systems in the retina and early visual centers. According to the documents, multiple processing systems operate in parallel at the level of the ganglion cells in mammalian retina. This suggests that first-order neurons are present at the retinal level.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: all of the above\"\n}"]
