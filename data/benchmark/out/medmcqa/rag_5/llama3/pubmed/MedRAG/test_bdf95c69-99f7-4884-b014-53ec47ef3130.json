["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about RNAi (RNA interference), which is a mechanism that causes the degradation of specific mRNA sequences. The question asks what RNAi does to a gene. Based on the provided documents, there is no direct mention of RNAi, but it can be inferred from the context of the documents. The document 'Mechanism of action of antisense RNA' mentions that AS (antisense) RNA inhibits gene expression, which is similar to RNAi's mechanism. Therefore, we can infer that RNAi causes inhibition or down-regulation of gene expression.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C: Knock down\""]
