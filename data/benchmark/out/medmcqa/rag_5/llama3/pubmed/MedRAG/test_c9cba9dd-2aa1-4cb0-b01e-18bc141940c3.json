["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the definition of stiffness. Stiffness is related to the mechanical properties of a material or tissue. Based on the provided documents, we can see that stiffness is being measured in terms of elastic modulus (0.06-1 MPa) and dynamic stiffness in muscle contraction. This suggests that stiffness refers to the resistance to elastic deformation.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
