["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe maxillofacial infections, including those involving the masticator space. The document 'Lymphomas of the masticator space' states that lymphomas of the masticatory space can occur without involvement in other areas, and excisional biopsies were performed because of a mass deep to the parotid gland. This suggests that infections or tumors within the masticator space may be diagnosed through biopsy or imaging studies. The document 'Maxillofacial infections' notes that established infections are usually recognized early due to obvious signs of infection and symptoms, which is consistent with the idea that infections in the masticator space would likely cause noticeable symptoms. Finally, the document 'Recognizing and treating deep neck infection' emphasizes the importance of detecting and treating deep neck infections early to prevent spread to other areas. Based on this information, it appears that infection of the masticatory space is not typically associated with tonsillar abscess, mandibular molar, lateral pharyngeal space, or parotid space infection.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
