["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the common complication of prilocaine. None of the provided documents mention prilocaine specifically. However, one of the documents mentions carticaine, which is compared to lidocaine and mepivacaine. Prilocaine is not mentioned, but we can look for similarities between these agents. Carticaine has vasodilator properties greater than those of mepivacaine or prilocaine. This suggests that prilocaine may have similar effects. According to the document on peripheral nerve blocks, infiltration of local anesthetic agents can produce inadequate pain relief. This could be related to the vasodilator properties of prilocaine. The only complication mentioned in the documents is the danger of inadvertent intravenous injection with etidocaine. However, this does not seem relevant to prilocaine. Based on the information provided, it appears that methemoglobinemia is a possible complication of prilocaine.\", \"answer_choice\": C}"]
