["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for the preferred drug to treat uncomplicated grade 2 hypertension. Grade 2 hypertension refers to mild to moderately severe essential hypertension. From the given documents, we can see that nadolol was effective in reducing blood pressure in patients with mild to moderately severe essential hypertension, and prazosin also showed impressive results in lowering standing blood pressure. However, there is no information about the preferred drug for treating grade 2 hypertension specifically.\n\nThe document on treatment of mild hypertension provides more information on the efficacy of nitrendipine as a blood pressure-lowering treatment. Although this study did not directly address grade 2 hypertension, it suggests that nitrendipine could be an option for treating mild to moderate hypertension.\n\nIn the absence of specific information on preferred drugs for treating grade 2 hypertension, we can consider general guidelines for managing hypertension in patients over age 65. The document 'The hypertensive patient' emphasizes the importance of targeting treatment based on risk factors and end-organ damage. Since there is no evidence of significant cardiovascular risk factors or end-organ damage in this 48-year-old man, a more conservative approach to treating his hypertension might be appropriate.\n\nConsidering these points, we can conclude that a diuretic or a beta-blocker might not be the best choice for this patient, given their relatively young age and the absence of significant cardiovascular risk factors. Instead, an option like nitrendipine, which has been shown to be effective in treating mild to moderate hypertension with few side effects, could be considered.\", \n\"answer_choice\": \"None of the above (A/B/C/D)\""]
