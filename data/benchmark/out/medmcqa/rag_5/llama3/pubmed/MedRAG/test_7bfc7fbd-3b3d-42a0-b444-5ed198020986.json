["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the cross section of the root most prone to vertical root fracture. We need to look at the provided documents for relevant information on vertical root fractures. One document discusses hemisection as an alternative to extraction in cases of vertical root fracture. Another document presents a clinical review of vertical root fractures, which may provide insight into the shape or cross section of roots that are prone to these fractures. Finally, we have a study on vital root retention in humans, which may also offer relevant information. After reviewing these documents, we notice that none of them specifically mention the cross section of the root most prone to vertical root fracture. However, they do provide general information about vertical root fractures and their management. Therefore, we need to rely on our medical knowledge to answer this question based on the provided information.\", \"answer_choice\": C}"]
