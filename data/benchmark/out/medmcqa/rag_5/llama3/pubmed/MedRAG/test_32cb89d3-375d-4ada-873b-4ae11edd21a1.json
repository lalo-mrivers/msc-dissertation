["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant document for this question is 'Morphologic study of the maxillary molars. 1. External anatomy.' According to the document, complete separation of all three roots was observed on 86.4% of the first molars, which means that one or both palatal roots are not separate from each other in 13.6% of the cases. Since we are looking for the percentage of maxillary first molars with two palatal roots, it is likely that this percentage will be lower than the percentage of complete separation. Based on this information, we can estimate the percentage of maxillary first molars with two palatal roots to be around 1-4%.\",\n\"answer_choice\": A"]
