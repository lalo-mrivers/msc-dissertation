["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for signs of respiratory insufficiency. Respiratory insufficiency can be caused by a range of disorders, including adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). In ARDS, the lungs are inflamed and filled with fluid, making it difficult for oxygen to reach the bloodstream.
