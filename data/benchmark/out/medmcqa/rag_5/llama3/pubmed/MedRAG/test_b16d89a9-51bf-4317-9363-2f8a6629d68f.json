["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"After analyzing the relevant documents, I found that fluoride absorption is discussed in two of them. In 'Effect of concurrent calcium ingestion on intestinal absorption of fluoride', it is mentioned that 1.3 g of calcium decreases the integrated blood fluoride values by 22%. This suggests that the main site of absorption is the intestine. Additionally, in 'Fluoride deposition in human enamel in vivo from professionally applied fluoride prophylaxis paste', it is stated that the enamel fluoride level was increased approximately 300 ppm at a depth of 2.5 micrometers during the first month after the prophylaxis was administered. This does not suggest any specific site of absorption, but rather emphasizes the topical application and deposition of fluoride in the enamel. Therefore, based on these findings, I conclude that absorption of fluoride in children takes place mainly in the intestine.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
