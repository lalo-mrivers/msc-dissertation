["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for a universal marker of limbal epithelial stem cells. After reviewing the relevant documents, it seems that limbal epithelial stem cells are located at the limbal basal layer and play a crucial role in corneal epithelial cell proliferation and differentiation. The document 'Corneal epithelial wound healing in partial limbal deficiency' suggests that the residual stem cell capacity is challenged by corneal epithelial debridement, which leads to delayed wound healing, vascularization, and conjunctival epithelial ingrowth. This implies that the limbal epithelial stem cells are responsible for maintaining the normal corneal epithelial phenotype.\n\nIn the document 'Abnormal corneal epithelial wound healing in partial-thickness removal of limbal epithelium', it is mentioned that destruction of the limbal epithelium results in corneal conjunctivalization and vascularization. This also suggests that the limbal epithelial stem cells are responsible for maintaining the normal corneal epithelial phenotype.\n\nThe document 'Corneal epithelial wound healing in the absence of limbus' mentions that the constellation of delayed healing with recurrent erosion, corneal vascularization, and conjunctival epithelial ingrowth can be considered possible signs of limbal stem cell dysfunction. This further supports the idea that the limbal epithelial stem cells play a crucial role in maintaining the normal corneal epithelial phenotype.\n\nBased on this information, it appears that the universal marker of limbal epithelial stem cells is related to their ability to maintain the normal corneal epithelial phenotype. The document 'Corneal epithelial wound healing in partial-thickness removal of limbal epithelium' mentions immunofluorescent staining positive to AM-3 monoclonal antibody but negative to AE-5 monoclonal antibody, suggesting that the limbal epithelial stem cells have a specific marker.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: ABCG2\""]
