["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents are focused on craniofacial growth and development. The concept of pattern in craniofacial growth mentions the idea of craniofacial constants that are relatively invariant. New studies of cranial growth also discuss the functional matrix concept, which seems to relate to neurotrophic processes regulating craniofacial growth. Facial growth associated with a cranial base defect is also mentioned as an example of compensatory restraining influences. Considering these documents, it appears that Sicher & Weinmann's theory on craniofacial anomalies and embryogenesis might be relevant to the remodelling theory of craniofacial growth. This suggests that option D: Sicher & Weinmann is a possible answer.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
