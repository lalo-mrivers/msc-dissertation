["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about rapid tooth separation. In the provided documents, there are multiple references to orthodontic techniques, dental preparation, and oral surgery, but none of them explicitly mention rapid tooth separation or its principles. The closest reference is in the 'A new concept in the Begg technique' document, which describes a method for initiating orthodontic movement using separate arch systems (SAS). This could be related to tooth separation, but it does not provide clear information about the principle used. However, another relevant document is 'A key to the understanding of extraoral forces', which discusses different principles and planes of space in relation to extraoral assemblies. It provides some background information on force application and center of resistance, which could be useful for understanding tooth separation. Based on this analysis, it seems that the principle used in rapid tooth separation might be related to either wedge or traction, but more specific information is needed to pinpoint the exact principle.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"]
