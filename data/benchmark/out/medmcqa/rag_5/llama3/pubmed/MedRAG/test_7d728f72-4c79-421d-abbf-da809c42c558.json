["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about an injury to a deep part of the perineal body that causes cystocele, enterocele, and urethral descent. Reviewing the provided documents does not provide direct information on this specific topic. However, it seems that the answer might be related to muscles affecting the pelvis or surrounding areas. The document 'Urethral injury and fractured pelvis' mentions pelvic fractures and associated lacerations of the bladder, but it does not specifically mention the perineal body.
