["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks when folic acid supplementation should be advised to a 23-year-old lady taking antiepileptics for a seizure disorder. The relevant information is that the patient is already on antiepileptics, which suggests she may have epilepsy. According to the document 'Anticonvulsant therapy', increasing attention is being given to the effect of anticonvulsants on the fetus. This implies that folic acid supplementation should be advised when pregnancy is confirmed or at least before becoming pregnant.
