["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents mention the formulation of gypsum-bonded casting investments, specifically the addition of modifiers to increase thermal expansion. The documents also discuss the setting and thermal expansion of investments under laboratory and practical conditions. Since the question is about a thinner mix of a gypsum-bonded investment, we can infer that it's related to setting expansion. According to the document 'Dimensional accuracy of small gold alloy castings. Part 3. Gypsum-bonded investment expansion', adding certain modifiers like sodium chloride and glycerol increases thermal expansion. Therefore, if we have a thinner mix, we would expect a greater thermal expansion.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
