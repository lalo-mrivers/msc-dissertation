["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The passage 'The salivary secretions in health and disease' states that salivary composition is affected by both autonomic and hormonal stimuli. This suggests that the secretion of salivary gland may be influenced by internal factors rather than solely external ones. The passages 'Saliva and dental diseases' and '[Biochemical aspects of human salivary gland secretions]' describe the functions of saliva in preventing dental disease, highlighting its exocrine properties. Finally, the passage 'Intracellular modifications induced in mouse submaxillary glands by antibodies directed against saliva' mentions that salivary antigens are synthesized within the glandular acinar cells and secreted into their respective lumen. This suggests a merocrine-like secretion process. Therefore, it can be concluded that the secretion of salivary gland may be described as Exocrine and Merocrine.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
