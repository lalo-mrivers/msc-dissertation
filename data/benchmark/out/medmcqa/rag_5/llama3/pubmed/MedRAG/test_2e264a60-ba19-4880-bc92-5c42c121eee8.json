["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"There is no direct evidence about the extraction of 3rd molar tooth bud in 7-9 yr old child. However, we can consider similar cases discussed in the provided documents. Case report '[The extraction of a completely impacted upper second deciduous molar: case report]' suggests that removing an impaction can help with normal development of surrounding teeth. Intraoral third molar transplants: report of three cases and long-term follow-up' describes using third molars as replacements, but it's not directly related to the extraction of tooth bud. Odontomas--report of 3 cases does not provide relevant information for this question. Ankylosed primary molars provides data on ankylosis, which is different from impaction. Second molar extraction in the treatment of lower premolar crowding is about treatment of lower premolar crowding, not related to extraction of tooth bud.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
