["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to the document 'Direct pulp capping treatment: a long-term follow-up', direct pulp capping is a successful procedure for teeth with pulp exposure. The criteria for pulp capping procedures are in need of revision, and restrictions based on tooth size and age of the patient are unfounded.\n\nIn 'Pulp capping (a review)', it is mentioned that pulp exposure remains a source of great frustration to the dental practitioner because the outcome of any pulp capping procedure is marked with uncertainty. However, this does not provide specific guidance on when direct pulp capping should or should not be done.\n\nThe document 'Indirect pulp capping: a survey' does not provide information on situations where direct pulp capping should not be performed.\n\nIn '592 pulp cappings in a dental office--a clinical study (1966-1990)', it is mentioned that the success of this treatment seemed to be related to age, type of tooth, and the extent of pulp exposure. No specific guidance is provided on situations where direct pulp capping should not be performed.\n\nBased on the information provided, it appears that there are no clear guidelines or restrictions on when direct pulp capping should not be done.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
