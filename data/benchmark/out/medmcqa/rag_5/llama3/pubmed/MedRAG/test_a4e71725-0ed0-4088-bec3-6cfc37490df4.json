["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, we can see that UV light has been mentioned as having effects on the cornea. Specifically, phototoxicity of the cornea is discussed, which involves sensitivity to photochemical injury. This suggests that UV light exposure can cause damage to the cornea, but does not directly relate to the options listed. However, considering the context of photochemotherapy for psoriasis treatment, which involves using ultraviolet light, we can see that side effects are mentioned, including maintenance therapy and careful supervision.
