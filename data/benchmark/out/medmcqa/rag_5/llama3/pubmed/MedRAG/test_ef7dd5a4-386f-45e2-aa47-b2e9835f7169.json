["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about autogenic inhibition. The relevant documents mention antagonistic muscle inhibition before rapid voluntary movements of the human wrist. Inhibition means a decrease in antagonist muscle activity before the onset of the first agonist muscle burst (AG1).

Considering these definitions, we can infer that autogenic inhibition is related to the antagonistic muscle inhibition phenomenon mentioned earlier.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
