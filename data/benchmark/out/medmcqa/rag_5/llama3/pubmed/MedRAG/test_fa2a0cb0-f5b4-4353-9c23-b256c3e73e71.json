["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the surface preparation and characterization of MgO surfaces by reflection electron microscopy. The document on 'Fracture-surface analysis of a glaze-strengthened magnesia core material' discusses the fracture initiation point in a glaze-strengthened magnesia ceramic substance used as a core material for all-ceramic crowns. This information suggests that glazing is related to the strength and integrity of the material, particularly with respect to residual compressive stresses at the glaze-body interface.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: None\"\n}"]
