["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The provided documents describe Prinzmetal's angina as a variant form of angina pectoris. In one document, it is mentioned that 4 out of 5 patients had ST-elevations inferiorly, with only slight to medium coronary artery disease. This suggests that the ECG changes are not necessarily related to significant coronary lesions. Another document states that there was no demonstrable stenosis of the major coronary arteries in 19 patients. Therefore, it is likely that the ECG changes in Prinzmetal's angina are not primarily due to right coronary artery involvement or inferior wall MI.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
