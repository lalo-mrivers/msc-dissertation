["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the cements that hold with tooth structure. We can look at the relevant documents to find the answer. The document 'An in vitro study of certain properties of a glass ionomer cement' talks about the bond strength of a glass ionomer cement (GIC) and compares it to polycarboxylate cement. This suggests that GIC has good bonding properties with tooth structure. Additionally, the document 'Adhesion of glass-ionomer cement in the clinical environment' mentions that the development of an ion-enriched layer between the glass-ionomer cement and tooth structure is dependent on careful adherence to recommendations for clinical placement and recognition of the need to clean the surface of the cavity. This further supports the idea that GIC has good bonding properties with tooth structure.\n\nThe document 'Luting agents for ceramic and polymeric inlays and onlays' does not directly compare the bond strength of different cements, but it does mention polycarboxylate cement as one type of cement that is used. There is no information about ZnPO4 or silicate cement in this regard.\n\nTherefore, based on the available information, we can conclude that GIC and polycarboxylate are two cements that hold with tooth structure.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
