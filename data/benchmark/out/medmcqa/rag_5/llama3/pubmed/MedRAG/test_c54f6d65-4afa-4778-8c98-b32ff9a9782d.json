["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The given information does not directly relate to the case of amblyopia with rapid heart rate. However, we can look for information about amblyopia that might be relevant. The first document mentions eccentric fixation at the onset of amblyopia treatment as a poor prognostic sign, which is not relevant to this case. The second and fourth documents do not provide any information about amblyopia or rapid heart rate. The third document talks about correcting high anisometropia, which is also unrelated.\n\nThe only relevant information comes from the first document, which mentions that patients with strabismic amblyopia who achieved a visual acuity of 20/40 or better had a good prognosis. However, this does not provide any information about rapid heart rate or tachycardia.\n\nTherefore, we can eliminate options related to eye treatment and focus on the remaining options, which are all substances known for their effects on the cardiovascular system.\n\nThe patient has episodic tachycardia and occasional extrasystole, which suggests a cardiac cause rather than an ophthalmological one. Therefore, we should consider options that affect the heart rate or rhythm.\n\nCocaine is well-known to increase heart rate and cause cardiac arrhythmias. Atropine can also increase heart rate, although this effect is more pronounced in children. Nicotine and cannabis are not typically associated with tachycardia or extrasystole, although they may have other cardiovascular effects.\n\nGiven the patient's symptoms and the available information, the most likely cause of amblyopia and rapid heart rate is cocaine use.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
