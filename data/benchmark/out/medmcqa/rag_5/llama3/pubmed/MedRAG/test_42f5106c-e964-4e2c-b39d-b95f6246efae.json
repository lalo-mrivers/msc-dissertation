["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking which of the given options is primarily RNA-based. The provided documents describe various techniques related to RNA manipulation, synthesis, and analysis. None of the options seem directly related to these techniques except option B: PCR. However, upon closer inspection, PCR is not solely an RNA-based technique as it also involves DNA amplification. Option A: Next generation sequencing could be considered a primarily RNA-based technique if the focus is on RNA sequencing specifically.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
