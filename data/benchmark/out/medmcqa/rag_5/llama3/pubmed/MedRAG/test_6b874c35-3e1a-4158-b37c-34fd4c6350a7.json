The stool specimen shows the presence of multiple ova which are more than 100 Î¼m in diameter. This suggests a parasitic infection. We need to look for a parasite that can cause such an infection. The patient is 15 years old, so it's unlikely to be a disease specific to childhood. The size of the ova suggests a larger parasite.
