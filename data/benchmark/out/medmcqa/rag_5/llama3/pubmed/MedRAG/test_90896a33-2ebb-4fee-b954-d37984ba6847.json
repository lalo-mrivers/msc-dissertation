["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the under-5 mortality rate in the world by 2010. None of the provided documents explicitly mention this specific information. However, we can look for relevant data on child mortality and estimate the number based on available trends. The 'Levels, trends, differentials and causes of child mortality-a survey' document mentions that despite efforts to reduce child deaths, there are still significant disparities in childhood mortality between developed and developing regions. This suggests that child mortality rates might be higher in developing countries.\n\nThe 'The magnitude of the global problem of diarrhoeal disease: a ten-year update' document provides some information on diarrhoea-related child mortality. It estimates 3.3 million deaths per year among under-5-year-olds, which is a significant burden. However, this number only accounts for diarrhoea-related deaths and does not represent the total under-5 mortality rate.\n\nBased on these trends and available data, we can estimate that the under-5 mortality rate in the world by 2010 might be higher than the current rates reported in the early 1980s. Considering the rapid population growth and urbanization, it is likely that child mortality rates have not decreased significantly during this period.\n\nA closer look at the 'Patterns of fertility decline in developing countries, 1950-75' document shows that by the mid-1970s, some developing countries had already experienced declines in their crude birth rates. This could potentially translate to a decrease in under-5 mortality rates as well. However, this information does not provide a direct estimate for the under-5 mortality rate in the world by 2010.\n\nIn conclusion, based on available data and trends, it is reasonable to assume that the under-5 mortality rate in the world by 2010 might be higher than the current rates reported in the early 1980s. However, without more specific information, we cannot provide an exact estimate.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
