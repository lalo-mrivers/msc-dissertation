["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the timing of chicken pox infection in a mother that poses the greatest risk to the baby. From the 'Varicella pneumonia during pregnancy' document, it is stated that an infant born within four days of the mother's development of the varicella skin rash is at high risk, with the outcome being fatal in five percent of cases. This suggests that the timing of infection is crucial. The 'Herpes zoster in infancy' document reports three cases of herpes zoster occurring in infancy, and each case had a mother who had chickenpox during pregnancy. However, it does not specify the exact time frame during which the mothers had chicken pox. The 'Sonographic evaluation of pregnancies with maternal varicella infection' document notes that congenital varicella infection is unpredictable but all infants born to mothers with VZV infection in early pregnancy (13th to 37th week) showed ultrasonographic abnormalities suggesting infection and died by four months of age. This suggests that the risk is high regardless of the timing of infection during early pregnancy. However, there is no specific information about the timing of infection during late pregnancy.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: 8-14weeks\""]
