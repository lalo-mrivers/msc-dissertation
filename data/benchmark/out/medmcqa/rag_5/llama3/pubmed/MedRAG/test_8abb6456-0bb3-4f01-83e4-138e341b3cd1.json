["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"There is no direct information about the rake angle for tungsten carbide burs in the provided documents. However, we can infer that tungsten carbide burs are designed to remove composite restorations (from 'Characterization of wear of tungsten carbide burs'). The design of current burs may not be suitable for this purpose ('Characterization of wear of tungsten carbide burs'). This implies that the burs' geometry, including their rake angle, might affect their performance. Since there is no direct information about the rake angle, we can only make an educated guess based on the context.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
