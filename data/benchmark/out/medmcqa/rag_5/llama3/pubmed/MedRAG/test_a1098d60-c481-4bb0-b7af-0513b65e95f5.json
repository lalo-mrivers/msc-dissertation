["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks which heart sound indicates stiffness of ventricular wall. From the provided documents, we can see that stiffness is related to diastolic function (Congestive heart failure in patients with normal left ventricular systolic function: a manifestation of diastolic dysfunction). Systolic function is not directly related to stiffness. Therefore, S1 and S2 are ruled out. S3 and S4 are both seen during the cardiac cycle when blood flow slows down or stops, which can lead to increased pressure in the ventricle, indicating stiffness.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
