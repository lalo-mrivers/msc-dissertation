["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents describe the standard methods for preserving vertebrate blood samples for glucose analysis. In one of the documents, it is mentioned that blood collected from seals by venipuncture and transferred into tubes containing heparin had a significantly lower plasma glucose value than blood transferred into tubes containing sodium fluoride and potassium oxalate. This suggests that heparin might not be the anticoagulant used in PHC for sending blood samples for blood glucose analysis. On the other hand, sodium fluoride and potassium oxalate are mentioned as standard methods for preserving blood samples, which implies that they might be used in PHC. Therefore, based on this information, it is more likely that C: Potassium oxalate + sodium fluoride is the correct answer.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
