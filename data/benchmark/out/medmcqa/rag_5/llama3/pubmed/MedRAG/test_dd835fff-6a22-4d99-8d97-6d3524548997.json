["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, we can analyze that the surface hardness of dental stone is increased significantly by either method, which includes adding aqueous solutions of potassium salts (K2SO4, KCl, KF, KBr, KNO4, KMnO4, K2Cr2O7) in concentrations of 0.5-5.0% or crystallized in contact with alginate impression material previously immersed in the above solutions for 2 minutes. This information suggests that the hardness of stone surface is affected by the addition of potassium salts or immersion in a specific solution.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
