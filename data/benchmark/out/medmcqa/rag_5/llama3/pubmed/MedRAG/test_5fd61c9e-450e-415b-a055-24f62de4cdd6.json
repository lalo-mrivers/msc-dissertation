["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about what should NOT be done in case of wider osteotomy planned. The relevant documents are about various types of osteotomies and their techniques. There is no mention of pressing buccal and lingual plate, nor bone graft plus implant.

Options B and C are also not relevant to the context. This leaves us with A: Press buccal and lingual plate.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
