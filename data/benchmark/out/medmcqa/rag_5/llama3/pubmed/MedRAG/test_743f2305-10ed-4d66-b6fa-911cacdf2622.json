["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about which type of Hb is not affected by Rh isoimmunisation. Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) is a minor fraction that is glycosylated and its proportion is increased in diabetes mellitus. There is no relevant information provided about Rh isoimmunisation and HbA1c, so we should look for other options. The question mentions different types of hemoglobin such as Hbb-s and Hbb-p, but these are not related to the type of hemoglobin affected by Rh isoimmunisation. Therefore, we need to focus on the provided choices which are all related to Rh isoimmunisation. Anti-D is the most relevant option because it is a common antibody that can cause Rh isoimmunisation.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
