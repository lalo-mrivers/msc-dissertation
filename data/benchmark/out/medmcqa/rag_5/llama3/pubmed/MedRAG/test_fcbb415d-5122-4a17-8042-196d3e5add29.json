["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has delayed eruption of the second molar, which is a symptom that may be related to an odontoma. The radiography shows a dentigerous cyst surrounding the crown of the tooth, which suggests that the tooth is trapped in the cyst. This information is consistent with the case report 'Dentigerous Cyst--an attempt to ascertain the normal eruption of involved tooth in child patient.' In this report, the involved permanent tooth (21) entrapped in the cyst was not extracted and found to erupt in a normal direction after marsupialization.
