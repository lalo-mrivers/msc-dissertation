["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the chances of having an unaffected baby when both parents have achondroplasia. From the documents, we can see that achondroplasia is a dominant condition. When two copies of the dominant allele are present (homozygous), it will always express itself as the condition. Since both parents have achondroplasia, they must be heterozygous carriers of the mutated allele. For their offspring to inherit the unaffected allele, they would need to receive a normal copy from each parent. The probability of this is 25%, since there are two possible combinations: one where the child inherits the mutated allele and expresses achondroplasia, and another where the child inherits the unaffected allele.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
