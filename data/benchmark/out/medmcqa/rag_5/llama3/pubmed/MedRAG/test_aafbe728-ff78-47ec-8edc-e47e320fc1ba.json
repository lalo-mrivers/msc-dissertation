["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about calculating the potential generated due to movement of freely diffusible ions across a semi-permeable membrane. The relevant documents mention ionic permeability of epithelial tissues and mechanisms by which small molecules alter ionic permeability through lipid bilayer membranes, but they don't provide direct information on calculating the potential. However, we can infer that the calculation is related to ionic movement across a semi-permeable membrane. Among the provided options, Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz equation is the most relevant as it is used to describe ion permeation in excitable membranes and could be applied to calculate the potential generated due to movement of freely diffusible ions.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
