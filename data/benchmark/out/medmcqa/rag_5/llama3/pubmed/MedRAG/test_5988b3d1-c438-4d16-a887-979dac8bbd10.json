["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the shortest root of maxillary 1st molar. We can find this information by looking at the relevant documents. Document 1 (Morphologic study of the maxillary molars) states that the lingual roots of the first and second molars curve towards the buccal on 54.6% and 52.3% of them, respectively. Complete separation of all three roots was observed on 86.4% of the first molars, 75.9% of the second molars and on only 18.8% of the third molars. Document 2 (A computed tomographic study of the distances between the maxillary sinus floor and the apices of the maxillary posterior teeth) states that the apex of the mesiobuccal root of the maxillary second molar was closest to the sinus floor (mean 1.97 mm).\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
