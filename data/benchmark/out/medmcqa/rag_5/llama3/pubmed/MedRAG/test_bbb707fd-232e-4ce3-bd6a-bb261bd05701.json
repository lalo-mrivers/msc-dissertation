["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the most common cause of death in cases of acute poliomyelitis. We can look at the relevant documents to find the answer. In 'Paralytic poliomyelitis in England and Wales, 1985-91', it is mentioned that one patient died during the acute phase of the illness. Also, two children with previously unrecognised severe congenital immune deficiency died between one and two months after the onset of paralysis after receiving oral polio vaccine.
