["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, we can analyze each option to determine which one is true about the Widal test. Option A states that base lines differ depending on the endemicity of the disease, which is supported by the first document as it highlights the necessity for adjusting prevalence estimates based on the frequency of positive tests. This implies that the baseline values vary according to the endemicity of the disease. Option B suggests that O antibodies last longer and hence are not indicative of recent infection. This is also true, as indicated in the second document, where the Widal test was found to be positive even in the first week of illness possibly due to the hyperimmune state of patients. Option C states that H antigen cannot differentiate between subtypes. Although this information is not explicitly stated in the provided documents, it can be inferred from the context as Salmonella typhi H or O agglutinin titers are used for diagnosis. Finally, option D suggests that high titre value in a single Widal test is not confirmative. This is also true, as indicated in the first document where frequency of positive tests is shown to be a bad estimate and necessary adjustments are given.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
