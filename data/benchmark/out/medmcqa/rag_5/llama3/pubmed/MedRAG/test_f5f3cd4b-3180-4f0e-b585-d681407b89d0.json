["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Firstly, we need to know the mean IOP is 25 mmHg with a standard deviation of 10 mmHg. We can use this information to find the range within which 95% of the population would be lying. According to the normal distribution, approximately 95% of the data points fall within 2 standard deviations from the mean. Therefore, we need to calculate 2 times the standard deviation (2 x 10 mmHg) and add this value to the mean IOP. This will give us the upper limit of the range. Subtracting twice the standard deviation from the mean will give us the lower limit.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
