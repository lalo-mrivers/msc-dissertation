["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Since the question is about extraction of disto-angular impaction of mandibular 3rd molar, I need to look for relevant information from the provided documents. The document 'A retrospective study of characteristics of impacted mandibular wisdom teeth' provides information on types of impactions and their frequencies. The document 'Third molars and incisor crowding: when removal is unwarranted' discusses the extraction of unerupted mandibular third molars, but does not specifically mention disto-angular impaction or its complications. The document 'General dental practitioners' evaluation of the need for extraction of asymptomatic mandibular third molars' presents a study on the evaluation of general dental practitioners regarding the need for removal of asymptomatic mandibular third molars, but does not provide information on the specific complication associated with disto-angular impaction. The document 'Ectopic eruption of a mandibular first permanent molar: report of an unusual case' presents a unique case history, but it is not relevant to this question. Finally, the document 'Third molar surgery' discusses advances in diagnosis and treatment of impacted third molars, but does not specifically mention disto-angular impaction or its complications. Therefore, based on my step-by-step thinking, I can conclude that the correct answer is D: Dry socket.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
