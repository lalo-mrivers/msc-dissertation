["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the principles of pulse oximetry, which is a non-invasive method for determining blood oxygen saturation. The technique measures the absorption of light by hemoglobin in arterial blood, and is based on the principles of spectroscopy. Specifically, it relies on the Beer-Lambert law, which states that the absorbance of a substance is proportional to its concentration and the path length of the light through the substance.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
