["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the force generated by a 90Â° rotation of a finger spring in a pendulum appliance with distalization. None of the provided documents explicitly discuss this specific scenario. However, we can analyze the information provided to determine if any relevant data or concepts are mentioned. The first document discusses precision grip using pneumatically controlled loads, but it does not mention the specific type of load or device used in this scenario. The second and third documents discuss manual discrimination of force using active finger motion and isometric torque of the finger extensors at the metacarpophalangeal joints, respectively. Neither of these documents appears to be directly relevant to the question. The fourth document discusses biomechanical invariant of automated movement, but it does not mention pendulum appliances or distalization. Therefore, we must rely on general knowledge and assumptions about the possible forces involved in a finger spring mechanism to make an educated guess.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
