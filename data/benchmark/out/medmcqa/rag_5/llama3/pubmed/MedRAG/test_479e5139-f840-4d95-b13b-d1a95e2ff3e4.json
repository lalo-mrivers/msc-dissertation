This suggests that the treatment is focused on the pelvic region. The options provided are organs within the pelvic region. A thorough review of the documents reveals that radiation therapy has established roles in the curative, adjuvant, and palliative management of gynecologic malignancies. Specifically, treatment failure sites according to irradiation technique and histology in patients with endometrial cancer show that both radium alone and external irradiation plus diminished amounts of radium can lead to failures due to distant metastasis only. Adenosarcoma of uterus and ovary: a clinicopathologic study of two cases highlights the clinical and pathologic features of adenosarcomas, which are rare tumors.
