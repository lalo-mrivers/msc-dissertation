["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the action of digastric muscle. We need to analyze the relevant documents. The first document discusses gastric control of duodenal electric activity and does not mention digastric muscle at all. The second document describes a bilateral anatomical anomaly of anterior bellies of digastric muscles, which suggests that digastric muscles are involved in this anomaly. However, it does not provide information about their action. The third document discusses electromyographic activity in digastric muscles and opening force of mandible during static and dynamic conditions. This suggests that digastric muscle is involved in jaw-opening movement. The fourth document describes bilateral accessory digastric muscles, which implies that digastric muscle can be present in duplicate or triplicate. However, it does not provide information about the action of digastric muscle. Based on this analysis, we can conclude that digastric muscle is involved in jaw-opening movement.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
