["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the maximum dose of adrenaline that can be given when Isoflurane is used as a general anesthetic agent. Since there are no relevant documents provided that discuss the interaction between Isoflurane and Adrenaline, we should focus on the characteristics of Isoflurane. From the document 'Uptake of enflurane and isoflurane during spontaneous and controlled ventilation', we know that Isoflurane uptake rates are similar or even higher during spontaneous ventilation in spite of lower minute ventilation volumes. This implies that Isoflurane may not have any specific effect on adrenaline dose.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
