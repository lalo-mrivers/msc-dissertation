["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents provide information on the mechanical properties of bone. Compression of bone is resisted by its internal structure. The 'Mechanical properties of dried defatted spongy bone' document mentions that there was a qualitative deterioration of most strength parameters with age, and also differences between the sexes and between vertebrae and tibia. Spongy bone was found to have an unusual mechanical property that despite rupture, its compressive strength often steadily increased; this was especially the case for vertebrae from young males.\n\nThe 'Bone compressive strength' document provides a relationship between compressive strength of bone and apparent density and strain rate. The 'The compressive behavior of bone as a two-phase porous structure' document discusses the effect of marrow on the properties of trabecular bone specimens, but it does not specifically address how compression is resisted.\n\nThe 'Tensile and compressive properties of cancellous bone' document compares the mechanical properties of trabecular bone in tension and compression. It shows that there was no difference between Young's modulus in tension and compression, and there was a strong positive correlation between the values (R = 0.97). Strength, ultimate strain and work to failure was significantly higher in tensile testing than in compressive testing.\n\nThe 'A novel microcarrier bead model to investigate bone cell responses to mechanical compression in vitro' document discusses periosteal cells grown in macroporous microcarrier bead columns cyclically loaded with compressive force. It does not provide information on how compression is resisted.\n\nBased on the available information, it can be concluded that compression of bone is resisted by its internal structure, particularly the collagen component.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
