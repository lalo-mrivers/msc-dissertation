["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant document is 'Antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity in humans. I. Characterization of the effector cell.' This document describes the characteristics of a non-adherent, non-phagocytic, medium-sized lymphoid cell that is involved in antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity. The text states that this cell is not detectable in early human fetuses and its activity is destroyed by x-ray treatment in vitro. It also mentions that this cell is rapidly lost in culture but can be prevented from losing efficiency by stimulation with allogeneic cells.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
