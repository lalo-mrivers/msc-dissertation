["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about a specific type of visual field defect, which is keyhole-shaped. This type of defect is described in the document 'Bitemporal visual field defects in presumed multiple sclerosis'. The document states that three patients with presumed multiple sclerosis had bitemporal hemianopia mimicking that caused by parasellar tumors; the visual loss was probably due to a plaque within the chiasm. This suggests that the keyhole-shaped defect is related to the optic chiasma. Therefore, the correct answer is B: Optic chiasma.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
