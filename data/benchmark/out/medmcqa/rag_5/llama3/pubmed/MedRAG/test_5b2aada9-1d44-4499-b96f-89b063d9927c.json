["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe lactose intolerance as a condition where the body cannot absorb lactose, a sugar found in milk. To avoid symptoms associated with lactose intolerance, patients should avoid consuming high-lactose-containing products. Milk C (containing 37.5 g of lactose) induced symptoms in most individuals who were lactose-intolerant, while milk B (with 12.5 g of lactose) produced fewer symptoms.

Therefore, high-lactose-containing products such as condensed milk, ice-cream, and whole milk should be avoided by patients with lactose intolerance.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
