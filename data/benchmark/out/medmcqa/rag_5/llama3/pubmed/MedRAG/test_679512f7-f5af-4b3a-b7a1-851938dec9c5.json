["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, there is no information about cross-infection prevention measures for sensors in digital radiography. However, the document 'Information in infection control' emphasizes the importance of infection surveillance and automated detection of patients at risk of or affected by nosocomial infections. This suggests that infection control measures are crucial in a digital radiography/RVG setting. Considering this information, I will analyze the options to determine which one best prevents cross-infection with sensors.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
