["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Long-term flexural strength of glass ionomer cements document suggests that the pattern of change in flexural strength is material-specific. There are no specific data on tensile strength after 24 hours of setting for GIC. Therefore, we need to look for other relevant information. The [The effect of etching on glass polyalkenoate cements] document indicates that long-term studies carried out approximately 24 hours after the sample had been produced showed the highest values for bending strength to the breakage point.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: None of the above\"\n}"]
