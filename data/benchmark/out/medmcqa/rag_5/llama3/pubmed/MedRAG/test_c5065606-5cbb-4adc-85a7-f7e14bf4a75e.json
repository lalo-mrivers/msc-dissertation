["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the given documents, we can infer that a cell membrane is damaged by inseion of a micro needle. The document 'Cytoplasmic filaments and cellular wound healing in Amoeba proteus' shows that when a hole appears in the membrane of an amoeba, it quickly seals itself without visible loss of cytoplasm. This sealing process occurs primarily through constriction of the existing membrane by cytoplasmic filaments. This suggests that the repair of damaged cell membranes involves an active process involving hydrolysis of ATP.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
