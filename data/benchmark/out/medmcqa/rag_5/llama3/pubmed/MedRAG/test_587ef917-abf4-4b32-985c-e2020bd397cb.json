["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Anaerobic glycolysis is the breakdown of glucose to lactate without using oxygen. The question asks which compound produces 3 ATPs per unit glucose consumed during anaerobic glycolysis. From the given documents, we can see that fructose-1,6-bisphosphate is involved in glycolysis and produces 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate. This compound is then broken down to produce ATP. Therefore, we need to find out which of the options is related to fructose-1,6-bisphosphate or its breakdown products.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
