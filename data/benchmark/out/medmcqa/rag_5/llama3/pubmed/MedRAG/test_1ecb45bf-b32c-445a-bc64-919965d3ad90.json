["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about submental intubation as an alternative to tracheostomy. Submental intubation is a technique used when endotracheal intubation is difficult due to contractures or deformities of the larynx, mandible, or cervical spine. Looking at the relevant documents, we see that fiberoptic bronchoscopy is mentioned as an invaluable aid in difficult endotracheal intubation situations, including those with soft-tissue contractures of the mouth or neck and those with severe fractures of facial bones and/or mandible. This suggests that submental intubation might be used in cases where there are significant fractures of the mandible. Additionally, cervical pharyngostomy is mentioned as an alternative feeding method for patients with severe facial trauma. While not directly related to submental intubation, it highlights the potential complexity and severity of facial trauma.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
