["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the properties of superelastic nickel-titanium (NiTi) wires. They can withstand large deflections and on returning to their original shape after deactivation produce more moderate forces. The region over which there is a 'plateau' depends on the deflection and is greater the larger the deflection. This suggests that superelastic NiTi wires exhibit significant spring back in bending. In comparison, non-superelastic NiTi wires do not have this property as they do not exhibit such large deflections and forces. Therefore, it can be concluded that superelastic NiTi wires show more spring back in bending than non-superelastic NiTi wires.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
