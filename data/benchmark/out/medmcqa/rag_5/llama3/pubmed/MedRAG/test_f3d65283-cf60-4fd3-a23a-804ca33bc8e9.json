["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The key to solving this problem is understanding the balance between capillary hydrostatic pressure, interstitial oncotic pressure, and interstitial hydrostatic pressure. The net filtration pressure is given as 3 mm Hg, which means that there needs to be a balance of 3 mm Hg between the capillary hydrostatic pressure (25 mm Hg) and the sum of interstitial oncotic pressure (7 mm Hg) and interstitial hydrostatic pressure (2 mm Hg). This can be represented by the equation: Capillary Hydrostatic Pressure - (Interstitial Oncotic Pressure + Interstitial Hydrostatic Pressure) = Net Filtration Pressure. Plugging in the given values, we get: 25 - (7 + 2) = 3. Simplifying the equation, we get: 25 - 9 = 3. Solving for capillary oncotic pressure, we find that it needs to be 16 mm Hg.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
