["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The given case is an asymptomatic boy with E. coli culture 1,00,000 cc/ml on a urine specimen obtained by mid-stream clean-catch void. The symptoms usually ascribed to the urinary tract in older children and adults did not discriminate for infection in this age group and were not a reliable indicator of the presence or absence of significant bacteriuria. Hence, we need to look at other studies for guidance.\n\nFrom the study 'Laboratory diagnosis of urinary tract infection in children', it is seen that symptoms usually ascribed to the urinary tract did not discriminate for infection in this age group.\n\nThe study 'Incidence and outcome of symptomatic urinary tract infection in children' suggests that all children should undergo radiological investigation after their first confirmed infection. This case does not mention any history of UTI or radiological abnormalities, so we cannot infer that the boy has a pre-existing condition.\n\nFrom the study 'Diagnostic value of symptoms and clean-voided urine specimen in childhood urinary tract infection', it is seen that the diagnostic accuracies of various indices were lower in asymptomatic patients. This suggests that the diagnosis may not be reliable based on symptoms or even culture results alone.\n\nConsidering all these points, we need to consider the possibility of significant bacteriuria in this boy and take further steps to investigate his case.\", \n\"answer_choice\": \"B: No therapy\""]
