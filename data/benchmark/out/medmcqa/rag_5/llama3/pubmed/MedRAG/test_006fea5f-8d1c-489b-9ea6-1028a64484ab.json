["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the provided documents, we can infer that Fingerprinting (FINDER) involves recording prints of 8 fingers. The relevant document is 'The analysis of whorls on specific fingertips with respect to sex, bilateral asymmetry, and genetic relationship.' This document mentions a sample of 539 Polish families, where 1000 individuals were analysed to determine the distribution of whorl patterns on specific fingertips. We can assume that this study is related to Fingerprinting (FINDER). The document describes the analysis of whorls on specific fingertips, including digit VI, and mentions no other fingers besides the digits I-VI. Therefore, we can conclude that the ring finger, little finger, middle finger, and thumb are included in Fingerprinting (FINDER), as they are mentioned in the context of fingerprint patterns.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
