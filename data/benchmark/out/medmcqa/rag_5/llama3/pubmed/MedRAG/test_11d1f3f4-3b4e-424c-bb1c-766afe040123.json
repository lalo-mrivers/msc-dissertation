["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents discuss fluid replacement therapy for burn patients. The importance of colloid and plasma during the early resuscitation phase is questioned. However, the HALFD method used since 1976 has been shown to be effective in treating burn shock. This method involves maintaining mean arterial pressure between 60-110 torr and urine volume at 30-50 ml/hr. Given that the patient was brought to the casualty 8 hours after sustaining burns, it is likely that fluid replacement therapy is necessary. The best formula to calculate the amount of fluid to be replenished would involve considering the percentage of body surface area burned (TBSA) and the patient's weight.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: 4 mL/kg x %TBSA in first 8 hours followed by 2 mL/ kg/hour x %TBSA\"\n}"]
