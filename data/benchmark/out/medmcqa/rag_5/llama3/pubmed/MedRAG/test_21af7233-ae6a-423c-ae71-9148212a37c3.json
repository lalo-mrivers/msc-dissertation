["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the binding of calcium ions to trigger muscle contraction. The relevant documents mention myosin binding to Ca2+ under physiological conditions, which suggests that Ca2+ binds to myosin. Additionally, the document 'Calcium binding induces conformational changes in muscle regulatory proteins' mentions EF-hand structural motif in muscle regulatory proteins, including troponin and tropomyosin, but does not explicitly mention their involvement in muscle contraction triggered by Ca2+ binding.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
