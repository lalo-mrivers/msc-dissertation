["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The perinatal mortality rate is the ratio of perinatal deaths to total births. The question asks for the denominator. Based on the given documents, we can see that the perinatal mortality rates are calculated as perinatal deaths divided by total births in some cases (e.g., Perinatal mortality statistics in Harare 1980-1989) and perinatal deaths divided by live births in other cases (e.g., Perinatal mortality in Cape Town). However, the key document that helps us answer this question is 'Importance of the first day death rate in infant mortality' which explicitly states that perinatal mortality rate is usually calculated as perinatal deaths divided by total live births. Therefore, we can conclude that the denominator for perinatal moality rate is Live bihs + Still bih.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
