["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks when calcification of third molar begins. None of the given documents mention third molars or their development. However, we can look for information about the development of second premolars as they have a similar timeline to third molars. According to the document 'A longitudinal radiographic study of the mineralization of 2nd premolars', odontogenesis of the 2nd premolar begins in the majority of cases at the age of 3-3 1/2 years, which is earlier than what we would expect for third molars. Third molars typically begin to calcify around 8-12 years old.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
