["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"After reviewing the provided documents, I found that calcium levels can increase due to various factors. The study 'Does baseline serum total calcium level influence the blood pressure response to calcium supplementation?' shows that after 8 weeks of calcium supplementation, serum total calcium was greater in the treatment group compared to the placebo group (p = 0.02). Additionally, the study 'Calcium determination in primary hyperparathyroidism' highlights the importance of monitoring calcium levels and notes that calcium is the most closely controlled substance in the blood. The biologic variation of total calcium is approximately 2% and of the biologically active free (ionized, ionic) calcium only 1%. This suggests that small changes in calcium levels can occur.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
