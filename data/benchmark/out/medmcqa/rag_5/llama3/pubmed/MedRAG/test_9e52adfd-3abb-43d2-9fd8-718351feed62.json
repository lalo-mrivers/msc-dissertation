["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the maximum penetration among alpha, beta, gamma, and electron beams. We can look at the characteristics of each type of radiation to determine which one has the deepest penetration.\n\nAlpha particles are high-energy particles that have a very short range in tissue, typically only a few millimeters.\n\nBeta particles have a slightly longer range than alpha particles but still have a relatively short range, typically up to 10 mm.\n\nGamma rays and electron beams both have a much longer range in tissue. Gamma rays can penetrate several centimeters into tissue before being absorbed, while electron beams can also penetrate several centimeters depending on the energy of the beam.\n\nBased on this information, we can conclude that gamma rays or electron beams are likely to have the maximum penetration among the options listed.\", \n\"answer_choice\": C"]
