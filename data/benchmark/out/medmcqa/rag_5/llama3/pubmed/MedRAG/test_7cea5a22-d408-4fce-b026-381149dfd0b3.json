["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the centre of rotation during intrusion. There are no relevant documents provided that specifically discuss the centre of rotation during tooth intrusion. However, we can look at the documents for information on centre of rotation in general. The document 'Calculation of the instantaneous centre of rotation for a rigid body' discusses calculating the centre of rotation based on kinematic measurement data. This is not directly applicable to tooth intrusion. Another document 'Passive motion of the elbow joint' discusses the axis of rotation during elbow flexion, which lies approximately at the center of the trochlea. This does not seem related to tooth intrusion either. The other documents appear unrelated to tooth intrusion or centre of rotation.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
