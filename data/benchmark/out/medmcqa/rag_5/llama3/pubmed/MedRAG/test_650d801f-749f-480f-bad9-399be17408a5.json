["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the morphology of acinar cells from various glands. The Golgi apparatus is mentioned as being present in these cells. In [Differential distribution of salivary agglutinin and amylase in the Golgi apparatus and secretory granules of human salivary gland acinar cells], it is stated that labeling with antibodies to two secretory proteins, agglutinin and alpha-amylase, was found in the trans Golgi saccules, trans Golgi network, and immature and mature secretory granules. The apical and basolateral membranes of acinar and duct cells were also labeled. This suggests that the Golgi apparatus is located near the apical region of the cell, which is consistent with choice B: Apical.\", \"answer_choice\": B}"]
