["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking to differentiate between testicular failure and vas deferens obstruction. From the given documents, it can be inferred that azoospermia can be caused by both testicular failure (degenerative changes in seminiferous tubules) and vas deferens obstruction. A normal HSG rules out vas deferens obstruction. Therefore, we need to look for a diagnostic test that can differentiate between the two. The document 'Can follicle stimulating hormone estimation replace testicular biopsy...' suggests that high FSH levels with small testes indicate severe testicular damage, while normal FSH levels suggest otherwise. This information can be used to diagnose testicular failure.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
