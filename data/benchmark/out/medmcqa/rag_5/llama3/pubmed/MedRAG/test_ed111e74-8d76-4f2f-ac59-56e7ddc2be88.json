["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the most common presentation of abdominal desmoid tumor. In the first document, it is mentioned that histologic sections usually resemble those of an infiltrating fibrous tumour, a desmoid lesion. The radiographic pattern may be similar to any diffuse abdominal retroperitoneal tumor, metastatic disease, lymphoma, or possibly retractile mesenteritis. The clinical setting usually differentiates these entities. This suggests that the presentation may not always be specific. In the second document, it is mentioned that desmoid tumors are rare benign neoplasias, locally aggressive and potentially recurrent after surgery. Etiopathogenetic, diagnostic, and therapeutic features of these tumors are analysed and the value of surgery as well as chemo- or radiotherapy is considered. This does not provide specific information about presentation. In the fourth document, it is mentioned that we retrospectively reviewed clinical records and CT scans of 25 patients with abdominal desmoids. The number, location, and CT characteristics of the lesions were recorded for each patient. Tumors were solitary in 72% of patients and multiple in 28%. Fifty percent were located in the abdominal wall, 41% in the mesentery, and 9% in the retroperitoneum. More than two thirds of the lesions had well-defined borders, with the remainder displaying an infiltrative outer margin. The majority of tumors had attenuation values equal to (47%) or greater than (41%) the attenuation of muscle on contrast-enhanced CT scans. Complications attributable to the desmoid were commonly detectable on CT (hydronephrosis occurred in 36% and small-bowel obstruction in 20%). Our results detail the spectrum of CT findings and complications caused by abdominal desmoids. This document does not provide information about presentation. In the third document, it is mentioned that three cases of Gardner's syndrome are reported. Two patients had one and two carcinomas in the colon respectively. Postoperatively the two patients developed desmoid tumours in the abdominal wall, and one of them also an intraabdominal desmoid. This suggests that presentation may include abdominal mass.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
