["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The provided documents describe endobronchial tuberculosis progressing to bronchiectasis. We know that bronchiectasis predisposes patients to infection, which may lead to lung disease. Auscultation findings in a patient with post-tuberculosis bronchiectasis are likely related to the airway obstruction and increased bronchial blood flow mentioned in the document. Late inspiratory crackles are often seen in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which is not directly related to post-tuberculosis bronchiectasis. Bibasilar crepts may be present but it's not a specific finding for this condition. Tubular breath sounds could be expected due to airway obstruction, so option D seems plausible. However, the document also mentions increased bronchial blood flow and hemoptysis, which is more consistent with late inspiratory crackles.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
