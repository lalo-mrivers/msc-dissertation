["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The passage Crystallographic behaviour of fluoridated hydroxyapatites containing Mg2+ and CO3(2-) ions discusses the effect of fluoride on apatite crystal growth. It mentions that both magnesium and carbonate ions are substituted into the apatite crystals, but it does not mention which ion is substituted by fluoride. However, another passage Surface properties of hydroxyapatite: I. The effect of various inorganic ions on the electrophoretic behavior states that fluoride ions increase the charge density and make the surface less prone to attack by acid or alkali. This implies that fluoride substitutes for a species on the surface of the hydroxyapatite crystals, but it does not specify which one. Enamel apatite: chemistry, structure and properties discusses the composition and basic structural features of enamel apatite, including the presence of impurities like fluoride. It suggests that most impurities disrupt the lattice structure, but a few are beneficial. This implies that fluoride may be beneficial in hydroxyapatite crystals, which could impart strength to them. However, the passages do not provide specific information on which ion is substituted by fluoride.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: None\""]
