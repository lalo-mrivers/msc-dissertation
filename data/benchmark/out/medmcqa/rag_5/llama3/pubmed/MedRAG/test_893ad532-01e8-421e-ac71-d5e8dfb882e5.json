["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking which option is NOT a feature of Wilson's disease in a child. The given documents are about medicine, literature, instructional text, cancer metastasis, audit, and magnetic resonance. There is no mention of Wilson's disease or its features in any of these documents. Therefore, we need to rely on our general medical knowledge. Wilson's disease is a genetic disorder that affects copper metabolism, and it can present with features such as Kayser-Fleischer rings, liver damage, kidney damage, hemolytic anemia, and neurologic symptoms.\n\nThe correct answer would be the option that does not match any of these features.
