["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, CFI (chemotactic factor inactivator) has been isolated from whole human serum. Two distinct chemotactic factor inactivators have been obtained, a beta-globulin with a sedimentation velocity of approximately 7S and an alpha-globulin with a sedimentation velocity of approximately 4S. The CFI in crude fractions of human serum is heat labile, time and temperature dependent for its activity, and pH dependent, expressing optimal activity at a pH range of 7.2 to 7.4.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"None of the above\"\n}"]
