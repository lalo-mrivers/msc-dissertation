["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the given documents, we know that vertical transmission of hepatitis B occurs mainly through intrapartum transmission. The risk of transmission from HBsAg positive mothers to infants is 16.66% (from 'Hepatitis B virus infection in pregnant mothers and its transmission to infants'). Since the mother is both HBsAg positive and anti-HBe Ag positive, we can refer to 'Vertical transmission of hepatitis B in north India' which states that if the mother is only HBsAg positive, the risk of transmission is 17.3%. Given that the mother is also anti-HBe Ag positive, the risk of transmission would be lower, as mentioned in the same document (9%). Therefore, we can conclude that the risk of transmission of Hepatitis B from this mother to her child is likely to be around 9%.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
