["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents are about calcium phosphates on dentin, mineralization of predentin and dentin, effect of matrix bound phosphate and fluoride on mineralization of dentin. The key information is that the inorganic component of dentin (ID) was ineffective as a crystal nucleator. Dentin bonding systems were reviewed but no specific phosphoryn related to dentin presence was mentioned. Calcium-specific precipitation of dentin phosphoprotein was discussed, which suggests that dentin phosphoproteins could be an indicator for dentin presence. Molecular control of dentinogenesis did not mention any specific phosphoryn, but it discussed the importance of transcription and translation controls of dentin matrix components.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
