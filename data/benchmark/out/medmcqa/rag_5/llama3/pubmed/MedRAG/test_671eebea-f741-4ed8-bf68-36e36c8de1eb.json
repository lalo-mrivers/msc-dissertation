["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents provided discuss the effects of noise exposure on hearing loss. The first document mentions subtle mid-frequency cochlear dysfunction and word discrimination in noise-exposed listeners. This suggests that the impact is on the auditory system, specifically the cochlea. The second document discusses middle ear disorders providing protection from noise-induced hearing loss. This implies that the effect is more related to the outer or middle ear rather than the inner ear. The third document sets out the issues involved in considering noise-induced hearing damage and provides guidelines for measuring sound levels. It does not specifically mention the structures affected by noise-induced hearing loss. The fourth and fifth documents discuss speech in noise tests and measurement of sound, but do not provide specific information on the structural effects of noise-induced hearing loss. Therefore, it can be inferred that the impact of noise-induced hearing loss is more related to the cochlea or auditory system rather than any specific structure such as hair cells.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
