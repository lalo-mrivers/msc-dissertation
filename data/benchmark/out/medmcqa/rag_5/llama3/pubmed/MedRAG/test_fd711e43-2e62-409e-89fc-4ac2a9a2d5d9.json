["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the important marker of male infertility in semen analysis. Upon reviewing the provided documents, I found that testicular biopsy score count is related to the chance of fertility (Value of a testicular biopsy rating for prognosis in oligozoospermia). However, the question specifically asks about semen analysis, so I will focus on the characteristics mentioned in the objective evaluation of sperm motility and values of velocity. The document highlights the differences between normozoospermic men and those with proved fertility, particularly in younger age groups. This suggests that sperm motility might be an important marker of male infertility. However, another document (Longitudinal study of semen quality in Wisconsin men over one decade) concludes that there was no decline in semen quality over a 10-year period, which implies that other factors may contribute to male infertility. Therefore, based on the provided information, I think sperm motility is an important marker of male infertility.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
