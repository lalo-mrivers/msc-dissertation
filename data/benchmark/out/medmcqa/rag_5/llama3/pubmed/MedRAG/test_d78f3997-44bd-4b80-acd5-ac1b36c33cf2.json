["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about fixation period for intrusive luxation injuries. The relevant documents discuss various types of luxations, including hip joint, shoulder, lunate, eyeball, and globe luxations. None of the documents specifically mention fixation period for luxation injuries. However, one document discusses the importance of immediate reduction in dislocations of the lunate and its associated injuries, which suggests that prompt treatment is crucial. Another document emphasizes the need for repositioning in cases of globe luxation. These findings suggest that fixation period might be shorter than what is commonly expected, but there is no concrete evidence to support this claim.\", \"answer_choice\": D}"]
