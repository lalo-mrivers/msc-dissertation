["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the presence of collagen fibers and fibroblasts in gingival connective tissue. From the given documents, we can see that collagen fibrils are present in the lamina propria of human gingiva (Collagen resorption by fibroblasts in human gingiva) and that fibroblasts contain intracellular collagen fibrils (Phagocytosis of collagen by human gingival fibroblasts in vitro). The occurrence of mononuclear cells at sites of osteoclastic bone resorption in experimental periodontitis also mentions the presence of collagen fibrils within these cells. Therefore, we can conclude that both collagen fibers and fibroblasts are present in gingival connective tissue.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
