["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant document is 'Effect of x-ray filtration on dose and image performance of CT scanners.' It discusses the use of x-ray source filtration to reduce patient dose while maintaining image quality. The document mentions that a filter material with an atomic number from 29 to 40, such as aluminum, can be used. The optimal thickness of the filter is also mentioned, which is 4 mm for aluminum at 120 kVp. This information suggests that an aluminium filter is being used to modify the photon beam.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C: Reduce radiation to the skin of the patient\"\n}"]
