["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about phage-mediated change in C. diphtheria. We can look at the relevant documents to find information on this topic. In one of the documents, it mentions that a study was carried out to investigate the circulation of toxigenic and non-toxigenic diphtheria bacilli under conditions of a natural course of the epidemic process. The document states that no formation of the toxigenic variants of diphtheria bacillus as a result of phage conversion was revealed in the foci of carrier state despite the wide spread in them of nontoxigenic lysosensitive cultures capable of acquiring the toxigenic properties under experimental conditions, and of the cultures which had converting corinephages. This suggests that phage-mediated change is not responsible for the conversion of non-toxigenic strains to toxigenic ones.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
