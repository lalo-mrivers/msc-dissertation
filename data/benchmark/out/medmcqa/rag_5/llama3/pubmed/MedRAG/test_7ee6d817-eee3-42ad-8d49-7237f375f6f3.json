["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for a biomarker of alcoholic hepatitis. In the provided documents, we see that alpha-fetoprotein was detected in a patient with alcoholic hepatitis during the acute phase of the illness and no longer detected as clinical improvement developed. We also know that serum immunoglobulin A concentration was increased in all groups of alcoholics and this increase was related to the severity of liver damage.
