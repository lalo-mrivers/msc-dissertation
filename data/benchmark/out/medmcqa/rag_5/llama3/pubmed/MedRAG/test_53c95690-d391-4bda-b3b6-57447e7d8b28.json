["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe various radiologic modalities used to diagnose diseases of the paranasal sinuses. In 'Malignant tumours of the sinuses', it is mentioned that radiographic evidence of bone destruction of the antral walls can occur in maxillary sinusitis. This suggests that erosion of bone is a possible radiographic feature of sinusitis. Additionally, 'Computed tomography in the diagnosis of diseases of the paranasal sinuses' highlights the value of CT scans in providing additional information about the posterior, superior and orbital extent of paranasal tumours, which may include erosion of bone. Therefore, it can be concluded that erosion of bone is a radiographic feature of sinusitis.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B\n}"]
