["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about a material that speeds up a chemical reaction without chemically becoming involved. From the provided documents, it is clear that enzymes are biological molecules that catalyze chemical reactions but remain unchanged during the process. The document 'Enzyme layers on glass as a new model for the quantitative study of capture reactions in cytochemistry, with special attention to acid phosphatase' specifically discusses enzyme-catalyzed reactions. Therefore, based on this information, we can conclude that an enzyme is the material that speeds up a chemical reaction without chemically becoming involved.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C\n}"]
