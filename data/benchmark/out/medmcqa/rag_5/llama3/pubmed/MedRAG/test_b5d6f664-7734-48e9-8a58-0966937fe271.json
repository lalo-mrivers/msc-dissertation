["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about a non-synovial joint with connective tissue in between. Synovial joints have a space filled with synovial fluid which reduces friction between the bones. The given options are all types of joints or connective tissues. A non-synovial joint is defined by the presence of connective tissue between the bones, so we can eliminate any option that involves a synovial joint. Saddle and C are not relevant terms in this context. Synchondrosis refers to cartilaginous joints which do not have a space filled with synovial fluid, so it is a non-synovial joint. Syndesmosis is a type of joint that connects two bones via fibrous connective tissue. The description fits well with the definition of syndesmosis.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A: Syndesmosis\"\n}"]
