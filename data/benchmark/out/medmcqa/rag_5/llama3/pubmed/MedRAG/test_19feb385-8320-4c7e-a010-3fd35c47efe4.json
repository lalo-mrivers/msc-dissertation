["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the angle between rake face and radial line. The relevant documents mention wrinkle lines radiating out from the lips (Excisions in the area of the chin) and directions of static skin tensions in the face (The directions of static skin tensions in the face). Wrinkle lines are mentioned as showing the optimal directions of selective incisions in most facial areas except for the medial canthus and upper and lower lips. The rake angle is likely related to these wrinkle lines, as it's an angle between a line on the face and a radial line. Therefore, the angle being described is the one between the wrinkle lines (rake face) and the radial line.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
