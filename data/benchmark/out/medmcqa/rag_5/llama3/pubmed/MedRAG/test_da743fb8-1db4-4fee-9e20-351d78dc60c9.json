["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with edema, oliguria, and frothy urine. The urine analysis shows 3+ proteinuria, no RBCs/WBCs, and no casts. This suggests a glomerular disorder. The patient's serum albumin is low (2.5 gm/L), indicating nephrotic syndrome. However, the absence of RBCs and WBCs in the urine rules out IgA nephropathy. Minimal change disease can cause proteinuria, but it often presents with edema and hypocomplementemia, which are not mentioned here. Interstitial nephritis is unlikely given the presence of frothy urine and proteinuria. Membranous nephropathy can cause proteinuria and hematuria, but it typically presents with hypertension and renal impairment, which are not mentioned.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
