["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The mechanism by which a cryogen destroys cells is complex. The formation of a hemispherical iceball composed of thermogradients, each of which maintains a temperature proportional to its distance from the application point, initiates the cryoinjury. This suggests that cell death occurs due to the freezing process, rather than evaporation or any other mechanism.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
