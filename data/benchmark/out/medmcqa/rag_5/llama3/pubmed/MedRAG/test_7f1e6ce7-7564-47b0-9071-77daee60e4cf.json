["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"There is no information provided about the morphology of deciduous mandibular first molar. However, we can look at similar documents for relevant information. The document [The extraction of a completely impacted upper second deciduous molar: case report] talks about the development of the tooth germ of the primary molar on the lingual side and later moves to the level of the occlusal plane. This doesn't provide direct information about the cusp morphology. We can also look at [Dental morphology of 45,XO human females: molar cusp area, volume, shape and linear measurements] which talks about the shape of the cusps but it's not specific to deciduous mandibular first molars. Finally, we can look at [Mongoloid features of the permanent mandibary second molar in Singaporean Chinese] which talks about the cusp morphology of permanent mandibular second molars. However, this document doesn't provide information that can be directly applied to deciduous mandibular first molars.\", \"answer_choice\": B}"]
