["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the side effects of Escitalopram. The relevant documents mention antidepressants and their side effects. Sertraline is mentioned as an example of a selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor (SSRI) that may cause side effects, but not suicidal behavior. Fluoxetine is also discussed as an antidepressant that may be related to suicide risk in some cases. Since Escitalopram is another SSRI, it is likely that its side effects would include those commonly seen with other SSRIs, such as nausea and vivid dreams. Anorgasmia is not directly mentioned in the documents, but SSRIs are known to cause sexual dysfunction as a side effect. Sialorrhoea (excessive saliva production) is also not mentioned in the documents.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
