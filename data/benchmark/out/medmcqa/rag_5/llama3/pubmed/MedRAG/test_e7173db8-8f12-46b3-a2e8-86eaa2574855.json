["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about a 17-year-old asymptomatic boy with sho PR interval and delta wave on ECG. The least effective measure for this boy would be the one that is most likely to miss or misinterpret the significance of these findings. Sho PR interval and delta wave are both indicative of Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, which requires further evaluation. Hotter monitoring (Option A) could provide additional information, but it's not the least effective measure as it can help in diagnosis and management. Treadmill stress test (Option B) is more likely to miss the significance of these findings as it may not show any abnormalities. Beta blocker (Option C) is a treatment option, but it's not the least effective measure as it could be useful in managing symptoms. Reassurance (Option D) is the least effective measure as it doesn't provide any further evaluation or management.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
