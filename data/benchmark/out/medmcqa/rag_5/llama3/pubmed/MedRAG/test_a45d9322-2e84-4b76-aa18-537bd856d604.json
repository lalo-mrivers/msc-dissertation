["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Ifosfamide's category is specified as 'nitrogen mustard' in the first document. This information is not provided in the given documents about metabolization or active form of ifosfamide, so I will focus on these aspects. According to pharmacokinetics of divided-dose ifosfamide, it appears that the degradation kinetics of ifosfamide are studied as related to pH and drug concentration. However, no information is provided about metabolization by CYP3A4 or chloracetaldehyde being an active form. Therefore, I will consider the neurotoxicity aspect. Ifosfamide's comparison with cyclophosphamide in terms of neurotoxicity is not mentioned in any of these documents. Hence, based on available information, ifosfamide's properties are summarized as a nitrogen mustard, metabolized through degradation kinetics rather than CYP3A4, and chloracetaldehyde being its active form (not supported by given documents).\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
