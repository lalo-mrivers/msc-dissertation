["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To calculate the GCS score, we need to consider three components: Eye Opening (E), Verbal Response (V) and Motor Response (M). Based on the information provided, the patient is opening his eyes on verbal command, which corresponds to E4. He also moves all four limbs spontaneously, which corresponds to M6. Since there is no mention of verbal response, we assume it's normal (E3), considering that he responds to verbal command for eye opening. Therefore, we add up the scores: E4 + V3 + M6 = 13. However, since GCS score ranges from 3-15, we subtract 1 from the total to get a valid score.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
