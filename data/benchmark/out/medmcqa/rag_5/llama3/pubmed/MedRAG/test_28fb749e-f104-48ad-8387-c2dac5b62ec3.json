["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the advantage of mediolateral episiotomy over midline episiotomy. The relevant documents mention episiotomy techniques, but there is no specific information on mediolateral versus midline episiotomy. Therefore, I will rely on general knowledge and consider the characteristics of these two techniques. Mediolateral episiotomy involves cutting from the center to one side, which might reduce the risk of extension as it does not cut as far laterally. On the other hand, midline episiotomy cuts along the entire perineum, increasing the risk of extension.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
