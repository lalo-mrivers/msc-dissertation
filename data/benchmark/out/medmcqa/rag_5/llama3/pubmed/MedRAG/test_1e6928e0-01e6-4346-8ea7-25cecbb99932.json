["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"After reviewing the relevant documents, I noticed that Esophageal cancer in Israel mentions that 'the most frequent localization was in the middle third of the esophagus, followed by the lower third.' This suggests that the middle and lower thirds are more common sites for esophageal carcinoma.

Multiple squamous carcinomas and the oesophagus does not mention the site of esophageal carcinoma at all.\", \"answer_choice\": A}"]
