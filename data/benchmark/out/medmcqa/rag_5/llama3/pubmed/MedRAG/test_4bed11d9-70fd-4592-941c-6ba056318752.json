["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents discuss the properties of alginate solutions and gels, but they don't mention Mgo (Magnesium oxide) as a component. However, we can look at document [Effects of sterilization treatments on some properties of alginate solutions and gels.] which talks about the effects of various sterilization treatments on the properties of alginate solutions and gels. It mentions that sodium alginate powder was treated by both gamma-irradiation and ethylene oxide sterilization, but it doesn't mention Mgo. Therefore, we can conclude that Mgo is not a component that affects the shear and tear strength of alginate.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
