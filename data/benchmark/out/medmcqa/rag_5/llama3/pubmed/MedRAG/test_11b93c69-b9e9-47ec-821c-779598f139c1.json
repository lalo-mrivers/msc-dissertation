["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents provide information about the spread of solutions during various types of blocks. The relevant document for this question is 'Paravertebral thoracic block-a reappraisal'. According to this document, a paravertebral block involves injecting local anesthetic agents into the superior and inferior paravertebral space. Since the anesthetic drug injected for paravertebral block is least likely to diffuse to, we can conclude that it will not diffuse to epidural or subarachnoid spaces as these are different regions compared to the paravertebral space. Similarly, it is unlikely to diffuse to intercostal space as this is a region specific to thoracic segments and does not involve the superior and inferior paravertebral space.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
