["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the method of transport of glucose in the intestine. The provided documents describe studies on sugar absorption by the small intestine in rat and hamster, including the contribution of diffusion to glucose transport. It also mentions that the physiological levels of glucose in the intestine imply that the diffusion component plays an important role. In one study, it is suggested that the diffusive pathway has an important role in intestinal absorption of glucose. Another study analyzes the transport kinetics of D-glucose in human small intestinal mucosa and highlights the importance of using non-absorbable markers to establish valid rate constants. Finally, a study shows that ethanol inhibits active transport of glucose, but does not provide conclusive evidence about the method of transport. Based on this information, it seems likely that diffusion plays an important role in glucose transport.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
