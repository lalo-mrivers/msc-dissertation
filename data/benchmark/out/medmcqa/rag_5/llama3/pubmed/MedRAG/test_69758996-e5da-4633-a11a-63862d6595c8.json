["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks for the average daily dose of vitamin-C. We have to analyze the documents provided. The first document talks about recommended daily amounts of food energy and nutrients, but it does not mention a specific amount of vitamin C. The second document is about oral administration of ascorbic acid, which means vitamin C, but it only discusses different doses (1-5 grams) and their effects on blood levels and urinary excretion. There is no mention of the average daily dose of vitamin C. The third protocol for using vitamin C in cancer treatment does not provide a specific amount either. The fourth document talks about the effect of vitamin C intake on plasma oxalate, but it only discusses different doses (100 mg/day and 500 mg/day) and their effects on patients with end-stage renal failure. There is no information about the average daily dose of vitamin C in this document as well. Finally, the last document studies serum bile acids during vitamin C supplementation and restriction, but again there is no mention of an average daily dose of vitamin C.\n\nTherefore, based on our analysis of the provided documents, we cannot find a specific amount mentioned for the average daily dose of vitamin C.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
