["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about Peau d'orange in carcinoma breast. After reviewing the provided documents, I found that Peau d'orange refers to a condition characterized by violaceous skin discoloration, which was observed in two patients with lymphosarcoma of the breast (document 6). The literature review in this document indicates that although some patients initially present with localized disease to the breast, dissemination eventually occurs. This information suggests that Peau d'orange is not directly related to infiltration or obstruction of sub-dermal lymphatics, as it is a sign of distant metastasis rather than local tumor growth.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
