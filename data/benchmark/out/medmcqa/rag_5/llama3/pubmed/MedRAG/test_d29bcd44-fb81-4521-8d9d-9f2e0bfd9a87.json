["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about choosing the length of suture material for a midline laparotomy. The provided documents provide information on various aspects of sutures, but none specifically address the choice of suture material length. However, it is known that sutures must be chosen based on biologic properties and interactions with tissues. Since this is an open incision, the goal is to approximate the cutaneous wound, which requires a sufficient length of suture material to close the wound securely. Considering the need for tension-free closure, a longer length would be necessary to accommodate the edges of the incision. Based on these points, it can be inferred that a longer length would be required.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
