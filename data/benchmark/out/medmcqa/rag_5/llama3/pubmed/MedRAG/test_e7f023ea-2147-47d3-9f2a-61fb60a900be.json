["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for an antidote for fibrinolytic therapy. Fibrinolytic agents work by converting plasminogen to plasmin, which then dissolves blood clots. An antidote would be a drug that counteracts this effect. In the provided documents, it is mentioned that all 4 available fibrinolytic agents (streptokinase, anisoylated plasminogen-streptokinase activator complex, urokinase, and recombinant human tissue-type plasminogen activator) activate the fibrinolytic system by converting plasminogen to plasmin. Therefore, we need a drug that counteracts this effect. Epsilon aminocaproic acid is an antifibrinolytic agent that inhibits the action of plasmin, making it the most likely candidate as an antidote.\",\n\"answer_choice\": A"]
