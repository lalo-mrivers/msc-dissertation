["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about mental retardation associated with an inborn error of metabolism. The first relevant document 'Management and counseling of children with inherited metabolic disorders' mentions that some metabolic disorders are associated with mental retardation, but it does not specify which ones. The second document 'Molecular analysis of 11 galactosemia patients' does not provide information about mental retardation. The third document 'Disorders of galactose metabolism' discusses the role of galactose metabolism in cell surface antigenicity and its metabolic function as a component of glycolipids and glycoproteins, but it does not mention mental retardation. The fourth document 'Dietary management of inborn errors of amino acid metabolism' provides information about diet therapy for amino acid metabolism disorders, but it also does not provide information about mental retardation. Therefore, we need to look at the symptoms associated with each disease mentioned in the choices. Alkaptonuria is a disorder characterized by darkening of urine and kidney stones, but it does not typically cause mental retardation. Homocystinuria is another disorder that can cause intellectual disability if left untreated. Pentosuria is a rare disorder caused by an enzyme deficiency, but it is usually asymptomatic. Galactosemia is a disease that can cause intellectual disability if untreated. Therefore, the answer should be either B or C, depending on whether we are looking at one or multiple options.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
