["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about high copper silver alloy compared to conventional alloy. None of the given options mention anything about mercury content in the final restoration, so it's likely that this option is correct. Upon reviewing the provided documents, we can see that there is no mention of 'high copper silver alloy' or 'conventional alloy'. However, document 4 discusses chloride corrosion resistance of low-gold casting alloys. It mentions that Ag-rich microsegregations in these alloys decrease their chloride corrosion resistance. This information does not suggest that the high copper silver alloy has any specific characteristics compared to conventional alloys. Therefore, option D is correct.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
