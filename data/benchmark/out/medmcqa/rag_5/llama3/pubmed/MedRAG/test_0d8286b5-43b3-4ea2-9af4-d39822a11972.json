["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the effects of microwave radiation on microorganisms and heat treatment on viruses. The document 'Mechanism of lethal action of 2,450-MHz radiation on microorganisms' states that microorganisms are killed by thermal effect only when in the presence of water. This suggests that dry or lyophilized organisms are not affected even by extended exposures to microwave radiation. Therefore, we can infer that dry heat does not involve chemical reactions such as lysis, oxidation, hydrolysis of DNA, or coagulation of proteins.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
