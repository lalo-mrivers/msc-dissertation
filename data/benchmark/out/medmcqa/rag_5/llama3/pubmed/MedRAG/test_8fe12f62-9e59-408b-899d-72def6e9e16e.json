["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the interaction of Vibrio cholerae with intestinal tissue. One paper discusses the adhesion of vibrios to mucosal surfaces and notes that loss of motility in mutant vibrios appears to be correlated with the simultaneous loss of adhesive factors (adhesins) from the bacterial surface. Another paper describes the pathogenesis of cholera, noting that Vibrio cholerae attaches itself to the enterocytes and multiplies on the intestinal epithelium surface without penetrating deeper or causing destruction of the epithelium. These papers suggest that Vibrio cholerae interacts with the intestinal epithelial lining rather than disrupting specific structures.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D\n}"]
