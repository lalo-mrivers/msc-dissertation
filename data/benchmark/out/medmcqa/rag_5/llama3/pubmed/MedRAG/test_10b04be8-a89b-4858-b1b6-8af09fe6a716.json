["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the mechanisms by which small molecules alter ionic permeability through lipid bilayer membranes. The studies on the mechanism of drug distribution in tissues and the review on drug transport across the blood--brain barrier highlight the importance of understanding how drugs interact with biological membranes. Specifically, the papers discuss the role of membrane composition, carrier-mediated transport, and specialized systems for facilitating the transport of certain compounds. Based on this information, it is clear that passive diffusion, facilitated diffusion, active transport, and endocytosis are all potential mechanisms by which drugs can be transported across biological membranes.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
