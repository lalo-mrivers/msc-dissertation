["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the crossed extensor reflex. We need to analyze the given documents to find information related to this topic. In 'Evidence of a contralateral motor influence on reciprocal inhibition in man', we can see that contralateral arm movement enhances reciprocal inhibition induced by extensors on flexors. This suggests that there is an informational array reaching the contralateral IA interneuron, implying bilateral interaction among IA interneurones. This finding supports the concept of crossed extensor reflex.\",\n\"answer_choice\": A\n}"]
