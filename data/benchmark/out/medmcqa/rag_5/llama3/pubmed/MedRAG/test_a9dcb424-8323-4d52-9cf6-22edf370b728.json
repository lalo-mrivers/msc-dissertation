["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking which joint best simulates the TMJ (Temporomandibular Joint) histologically and morphologically. From the provided documents, we can see that TMJs are unique in their structure and function, with a synovial membrane lining non-articulating surfaces within the joint capsule. Rabbits were used as an animal model for studies on TMJs due to the accessibility of the joint and its relative morphologic similarity to the human TMJ.\\n\\nGiven this information, we can deduce that the best simulating joint would be one that is also similar in structure and function to the TMJ. Among the options provided, rabbits are not grafts but a mammal species used as an animal model for studies on TMJs. Therefore, there is no graft that histologically & morphologically best simulate the TMJ.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: None of the above\""]
