["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the cofactors of glycogen phosphorylase, an enzyme involved in glycogenolysis. From the provided documents, we can see that glycogen phosphorylase is a key enzyme in glycogen degradation. The relevant information about this enzyme's regulation is discussed in 'Mechanisms of regulation of glycogen synthesis and degradation'. According to this document, covalent controls are one of the four principles regulating glycogen metabolism. Glycogen phosphorylase is also mentioned in the context of protein kinase A (PKA) and its role in controlling glycogen synthase activity. Based on this information, we can conclude that c-AMP is a key cofactor for PKA, which regulates glycogen phosphorylase activity.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
