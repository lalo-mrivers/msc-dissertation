["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to the provided documents, tooth morphogenesis begins with the early innervation of the developing deciduous teeth. The document 'The early innervation of the developing deciduous teeth' states that 'ingrowth of dental nerve fibres into the mesenchyme of the tooth-bearing areas of the mouth takes place at an relatively early stage, when the dental laminae are forming but the tooth buds are undeveloped.' This suggests that initial tooth development begins before the formation of tooth buds. Another document 'Tooth morphogenesis: the role of the innervation during induction and pattern formation' also supports this notion by stating that 'the innervation is present before tooth buds appear', which further implies that initial tooth development starts early on, specifically in the 4th week.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
