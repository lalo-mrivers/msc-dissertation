["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe various effects of digit sucking on the development of Class II division 1 malocclusions and deformities in fingers. They also discuss oral habits and their clinical management. None of these texts suggest that thumb sucking is normal during a specific age range, such as 'the first year of life', etc. Therefore, we must look for hints about when thumb sucking typically stops or becomes less common. In the context of the provided documents, it seems that most texts do not provide direct information on this topic. However, we can analyze the content and tone of the texts to infer when digit sucking might be considered normal. For instance, in 'Oral habits. A behavioral approach.' it is mentioned that thumb-sucking, pacifier use, and other oral habits are not so harmful or beneficial to the child to justify ill-timed aggressive discontinuance. This implies that some kind of natural cessation or decline might occur with age. Additionally, in 'Sucking habits: clinical management in dentistry.', we can see that excellent results were obtained by using the classical palatal crib for the patient, who is appraised as having morphological, functional and psychological changes resulting from finger and/or pacifier sucking habits. This implies that the habit might be expected to decline naturally with age. By combining these hints, it seems likely that thumb sucking would not be considered normal beyond a certain age, probably within the first few years of life.\",\n\"answer_choice\": A"]
