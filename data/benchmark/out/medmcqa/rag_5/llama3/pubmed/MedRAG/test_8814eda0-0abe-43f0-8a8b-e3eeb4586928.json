["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about which anterior pituitary hormone is primarily under inhibitory control of the hypothalamus. From the provided documents, we can see that corticotropin (ACTH) secretion is regulated by extrahypothalamic regions and not directly inhibited by corticosteroids acting on the hypophysis. This suggests that ACTH secretion may be under inhibitory control of the hypothalamus.\n\nIn the document 'Pituitary hormones in brain: where, how, and why?', we can see that peptide and protein hormones, including those from the anterior pituitary gland, are detected within the central nervous system. However, there is no clear correlation between neurotransmitters such as noradrenaline and serotonin levels in the brain and the degree of reaction of the pituitary-adrenal complex to stimuli.\n\nThe document 'Stimulation by growth hormone of somatostatin release from the rat hypothalamus in vitro' suggests that growth hormone (GH) may be involved in a 'short loop' feedback, controlling its own secretion via hypothalamic somatostatin release. This does not provide direct evidence about the inhibitory control of anterior pituitary hormones by the hypothalamus.\n\nThe document 'Do hypothalamic regulatory factors other than luteinizing hormone releasing factor exert a priming effect?' extracts of hypothalamic tissue were applied to pituitary tissue in vitro, showing that only gonadotrophin secretion was under priming effect. This does not provide direct evidence about the inhibitory control of anterior pituitary hormones by the hypothalamus.\n\nFrom the provided documents, we can infer that ACTH (corticotropin) is primarily under inhibitory control of the hypothalamus.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
