["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant information is that occlusal forces seldom exceeded 10 to 15 pounds. Additionally, the force values varied significantly from day-to-day, even for normal chewing patterns. Since this question is about full tooth-borne dentures and occlusal rests, we can focus on the forces exerted on the occlusal surface in normal chewing.\n\nAccording to the document 'Functional occlusal forces: an investigation by telemetry', forces were mostly less than 3.5 pounds, with only occasional higher values. This suggests that occlusal forces are typically relatively low.\n\nConsidering this information, it is unlikely that occlusal rests would transmit a high percentage of these forces to teeth.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
