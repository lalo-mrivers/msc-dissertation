["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the gingival embrasure as we move from anterior to posterior. The passage 'Exposure of subgingival margins by nonsurgical gingival displacement' does not provide information on this topic.

Therefore, we can conclude that the embrasure size should not be significantly affected by the location (anterior or posterior).\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"]
