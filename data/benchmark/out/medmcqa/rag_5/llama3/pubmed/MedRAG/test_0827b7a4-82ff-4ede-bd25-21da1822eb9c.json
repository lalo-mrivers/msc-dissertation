["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the contractile properties of skeletal muscles. The relevant documents suggest that different limb muscles belonging to the same mammal may have markedly differing contractile characteristics depending on the motor innervation. This implies that the contractile machinery of a muscle fibre can be modified by altered motor innervation, which in turn leads to changes in the synthesis of different contractile proteins.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
