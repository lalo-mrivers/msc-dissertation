["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about staging of GTN with lung metastasis. We need to find the relevant information from the given documents. The first document talks about the classification of lung cancer and does not provide any specific information about GTN. The second document also discusses the validation of TNM classification for lung cancer, but it does not mention GTN. The third document presents a case study of fine-needle aspiration of a solitary pulmonary nodule following treatment of metastatic giant-cell tumor of bone. This document provides some information about staging, but it is specific to the patient's condition and does not provide general guidelines for staging GTN with lung metastasis. Therefore, we cannot determine the stage based on these documents.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
