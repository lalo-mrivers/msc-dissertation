["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents provided discuss periodontal wound healing, with a focus on mineralized tissue formation. We can see that different types of mineralized tissues are formed depending on the host-specific and external factors. The Ultrastructure of sclerotic cemental masses suggests that the lesion is basically reactive in its biologic nature, which is reminiscent of fibroblasts involved in active tissue repair. This is also supported by Regeneration procedures: grafting materials, guided tissue regeneration, and growth factors, where flap debridement and guided tissue regeneration have been reported to successfully treat multiple walled intrabony defects. Healing results in bone regeneration with a long junctional epithelium adjacent to the root.\n\nFrom these descriptions, we can infer that regeneration leads to formation of cellular cementum, as the Ultrastructure suggests fibroblast-like cells involved in active tissue repair and Regeneration procedures support this idea by showing new cementum formation. Cellular cementum is further classified into three subtypes: cellular mixed cementum (CMC), cellular intrinsic fibre cementum (CIFC), and acellular extrinsic fiber cementum (AEFC). Since we're looking for the type of cellular cementum formed during regeneration, we can eliminate AEFC as it's acellular. Given that new cementum is formed during regeneration, it's likely to be cellular.\n\nFrom the descriptions, we can see that both CMC and CIFC are possibilities, but a closer look at the Ultrastructure suggests that the lesional cells resemble typical collagen-producing cells, except that many contain unusually large numbers of intracytoplasmic actinlike filaments. This is reminiscent of fibroblasts involved in active tissue repair, which further supports the idea that cellular cementum with fibers (CIFC) is formed during regeneration.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be B: Cellular intrinsic fibre cementum.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
