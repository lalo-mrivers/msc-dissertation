["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the composition of a cell membrane. From the provided documents, it can be inferred that the cell membrane consists of both lipids and proteins. The document 'Membrane lipid, not polarized water, is responsible for the semipermeable properties of living cells' states that the semipermeable surface barrier of living cells is provided by the lipid bilayer, which supports the concept that the lipid bilayer is a central structural feature of cell surface membranes. Additionally, the document 'The plasma membrane has been shown to play a critical role in the regulation of cell growth and proliferation, and pathologic change in the plasma membrane has been detected in neoplastic cells' mentions integral membrane proteins as being part of the plasma membrane, which suggests that proteins are also present. Therefore, it can be concluded that the cell membrane consists of both lipids and proteins.\",\n\"answer_choice\": A"]
