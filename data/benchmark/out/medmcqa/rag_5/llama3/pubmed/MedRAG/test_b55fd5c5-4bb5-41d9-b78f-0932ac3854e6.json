["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we can refer to the concept of normal ranges for various biochemical parameters presented in the second document. The values are reported for a sample of 40,000 events and are divided into four classes of age. We know that the data follow a Gaussian distribution since it is stated that 'if the data can be said to have a Gaussian distribution, the same precision can be obtained with smaller sample sizes than using the nonparametric techniques.' Therefore, we can apply the concept of normal distribution to this scenario. In a normal distribution, about 68% (or approximately 0.68) of the population falls between the median and the median plus one standard deviation.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
