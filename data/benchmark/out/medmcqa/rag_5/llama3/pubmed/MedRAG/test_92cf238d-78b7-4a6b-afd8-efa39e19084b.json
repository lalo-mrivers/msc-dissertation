["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the effects of cross-linking on mechanical properties. In 'The effect of cross-linking chain length on mechanical properties of a dough-molded poly(methylmethacrylate) resin', an increase in cross-linking agent chain lengths led to a decrease in tensile strength and transverse bend strength, but an increase in impact strength. This suggests that cross-linking can affect the strength-related properties of resins. Similarly, 'The concentration of the cross-linking agent as a tool for the control of release and swelling properties of gelatin microspheres' shows that increasing cross-linking agent concentration decreases drug loading, swelling degree, and drug release rate, suggesting a decrease in mechanical properties. In 'Characterization of cross-linked two-phase acrylic polymers', it is mentioned that a cross-linked network was formed in the particulate disperse phase, which could affect the mechanical properties of the material. Finally, 'Synthesis and evaluation of novel multifunctional oligomers for dentistry' discusses the potential benefits of using multifunctional oligomers as base monomers, including reduced polymerization shrinkage. While this does not directly address the question, it suggests that cross-linking can affect the mechanical properties of resins.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: All of the above\""]
