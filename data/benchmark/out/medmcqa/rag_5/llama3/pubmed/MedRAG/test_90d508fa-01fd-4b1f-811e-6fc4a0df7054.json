["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, it is clear that marginal fracture is a common issue with amalgam restorations. The document 'Marginal fracture of dental amalgams' specifically highlights the problem of severe marginal fracturing after 6 months' service. Another study 'The effect of time on the marginal fracture behaviour of amalgam' shows that marginal fracture increases with time for all alloys.\n\nConsidering this, it can be inferred that a high-copper alloy is more resistant to marginal fracture, as seen in the document 'A 14-year clinical assessment of 12 amalgam alloys'. Therefore, it would make sense that using a high-copper alloy (Option C: Pin retained amalgam) for an MO amalgam restoration could prevent or reduce the risk of fracture.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
