["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for the best way to monitor perfusion of free flap. From the given documents, it can be inferred that laser Doppler blood flow monitoring has been established as a reliable method for monitoring perfusion in autologous tissue transplants and microvascular reconstruction. This method has been shown to rapidly indicate perfusion compromise in free flaps more effectively than clinical observation alone. Therefore, the best way to monitor perfusion of free flap is likely to be Laser Doppler velocimetry.\", \"answer_choice\": B}"]
