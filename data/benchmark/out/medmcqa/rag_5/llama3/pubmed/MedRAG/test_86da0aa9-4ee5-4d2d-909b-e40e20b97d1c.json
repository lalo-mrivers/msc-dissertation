["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking which of the options is not true regarding myelopathy. Myelopathy refers to damage or disease affecting the spinal cord. Based on the provided documents, I will analyze each option: A (Sensory loss of facial area) and B-D are all possible symptoms or signs that may be associated with myelopathy. However, I found no information in the documents that contradicts any of these options. Therefore, I need to re-examine the question and the provided documents again. Upon further review, I realized that I didn't find any mention about brisk jaw jerk or pectoral jerk in the context of myelopathy. These terms seem more related to cranial nerve examination rather than spinal cord disease. This led me to suspect that option C (Brisk pectoral jerk) might be the one that is not true.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
