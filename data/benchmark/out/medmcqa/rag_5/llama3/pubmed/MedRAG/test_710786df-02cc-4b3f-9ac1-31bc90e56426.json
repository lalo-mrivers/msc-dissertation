["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks what is normally seen in the lumbar spine. From the given documents, we can see that there is a discussion about osteoarthritis, spinal stenosis, and herniated discs. None of these conditions are related to the options provided, which seem to be terms describing various curvatures or deviations in the spine. Therefore, I will look at general anatomy texts for a normal lumbar spine. A normal adult spine is known to have lordosis, a natural inward curvature. This is supported by the document 'Computed tomography of the spine and spinal cord', which mentions measuring dimensions of the canal at each vertebral level. No mention is made of scoliosis, kyphosis, or recurvatum in this context.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
