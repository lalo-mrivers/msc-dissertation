["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents provided describe the chemical properties and analytical methods for tetracycline derivatives, including chlortetracycline. The Fluorimetric determination of the active form of tetracycline, chloretetracycline and oxytetracycline in partially decomposed solutions document shows that only complexes with undecomposed antibiotics show a strong fluorescence. There is no mention of metabolic interference or DNA function. The Potentiometric and spectral investigations of anhydrotetracycline and its metal-ion complexes suggest that the C-11 oxygen was involved in metal-ion binding, but this does not imply a mechanism of action on metabolism or DNA function. Based on the available information, the most likely mechanism of action is inhibition of protein synthesis.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
