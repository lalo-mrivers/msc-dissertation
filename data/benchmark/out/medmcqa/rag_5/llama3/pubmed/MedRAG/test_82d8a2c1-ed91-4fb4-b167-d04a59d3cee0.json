["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about cerebellar lesions producing certain symptoms. We can start by looking at the documents provided. Infarction in the territory of the anterior inferior cerebellar artery mentions nystagmus as a symptom, but it does not specify whether it is related to cerebellar hemisphere or vermal damage. Speech disorders in cerebellar disease mentions dysarthria, which may be associated with cerebellar lesions affecting the left hemisphere. Cerebellar hemorrhage and CT scanning only discusses clinical syndromes of acute cerebellar hemorrhage without mentioning specific symptoms like nystagmus, past pointing, resting tremor, or ataxic gait. Changes in a motor pattern following cerebellar and olivary lesions in the squirrel monkey mentions the effects of cerebellar cortex and nuclei lesions on motor output, but does not specifically mention these symptoms. The cerebellum and motor learning discusses various types of motor learning affected by cerebellar lesions, but does not mention these specific symptoms. Therefore, we can conclude that resting tremor is not a symptom produced by cerebellar lesions.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
