["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the development of the primary palate and palatal fusion. In the Autoradiographic study of macromolecular synthesis in the fusion epithelium of the developing rat primary palate in vitro, it is mentioned that the facial processes involved in primary palate formation undergo epithelial fusion in a manner morphologically analogous to that observed during secondary palate formation. This suggests that the process of palatal fusion starts earlier than the onset of secondary palate development. The document 'Glycoprotein biosynthesis at the time of palate fusion by rabbit palate and maxilla cultured in vitro' also mentions an increase in glycoprotein biosynthesis in the rabbit palate in vitro at a time commensurate with the onset of contact and adherence of the palatal shelves, which implies that palatal fusion starts when the palatal shelves are still separate. Based on these findings, it can be inferred that palatine process begins to fuse around 6th-8th week of fertilization.\", \"answer_choice\": A}"]
