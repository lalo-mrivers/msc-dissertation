["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the effect of doubling the length of a spring. This is different from the context of muscle fibers discussed in the provided documents. However, one of the documents discusses the effects of stretching on the water-binding of muscle and mentions that when frog muscles are stretched to a length about 1.2 times greater than their original length, they lose 19 per cent of their water content on average.

The other documents discuss the effects of length changes on muscle fibers, but do not provide any information that would help answer this question.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
