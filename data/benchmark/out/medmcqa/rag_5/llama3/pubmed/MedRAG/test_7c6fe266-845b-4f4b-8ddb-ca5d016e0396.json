["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The provided documents are related to alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) levels and its expression in liver tissue. The question is asking about a key indicator for AFP surveillance. Based on the information from 'Alpha-fetoprotein levels in normal individuals', it seems that the stability of AFP levels over time is an important aspect. However, this does not directly relate to the key indicator being asked. Therefore, I will focus on the clinical significance of human alpha-fetoprotein and its use as a marker for primary hepatomas and tumors of germ cell origin. This suggests that elevated serum AFP levels may be an important indicator.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
