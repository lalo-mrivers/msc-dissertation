["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the reason why schizonts and late trophozoite stages of Plasmodium falciparum are not seen in peripheral blood smear. The relevant information comes from 'Concentration and separation of erythrocytes infected with Plasmodium falciparum by gradient centrifugation.' This document states that mature asexual erythrocytic forms (which include schizonts) are preferentially retained in the gradient solution, while parasites that are not retained in the gradient consist predominantly of ring forms. Therefore, it can be inferred that schizonts and late trophozoite stages of Plasmodium falciparum are not seen in peripheral blood smear because they have matured and been sequestered away from circulation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
