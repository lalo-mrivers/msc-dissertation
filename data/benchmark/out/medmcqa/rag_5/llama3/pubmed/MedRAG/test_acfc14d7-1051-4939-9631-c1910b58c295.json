["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about Magenta tongue and cracks at corner of mouth. The relevant documents are about oral ulceration and orofacial manifestations. One document (Focal epithelial hyperplasia in rabbit oral mucosa) mentions zinc-deficient rabbits, which could be related to the question.
