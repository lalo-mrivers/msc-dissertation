["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the role of Golgi tendon organ during voluntary movements. The relevant documents discuss neuromodulation, motor systems, basal ganglia, and striatal functions. Since the question mentions Golgi tendon organs, I focus on understanding their function in relation to muscle tension.\n\nFrom the provided documents, there is no direct mention of Golgi tendon organs or their role in muscle tension. However, one document discusses neurons that release slow neuromodulators and affect cellular and synaptic properties of central pattern generating circuits.\n\nThe document 'Function of caudate neurons during limb movements in awake primates' mentions recordings from single neurons in the head of the contralateral caudate nucleus during performance of visually and somatically guided hand movements. This does not seem directly related to Golgi tendon organs or muscle tension.\n\nAnother document, 'Basal ganglia--possible role in motor coordination and learning', discusses disinhibition as a basic process in the expression of striatal functions. This could potentially be relevant to understanding how efferent neurons are controlled during voluntary movements.\n\nThe last document, 'Actions of identified neuromodulatory neurons in a simple motor system' mentions activity of these cells affecting cellular and synaptic properties of central pattern generating circuits.\n\nBased on this step-by-step thinking, I conclude that the answer should relate muscle tension to Golgi tendon organ function. Since there is no direct mention of Golgi tendon organs in the provided documents, I rely on my understanding of their general function in relation to muscle tension.\", \n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
