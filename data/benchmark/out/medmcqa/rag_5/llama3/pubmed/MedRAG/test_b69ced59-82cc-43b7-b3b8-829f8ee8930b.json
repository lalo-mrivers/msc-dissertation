["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to the documents provided, platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) is stored primarily by platelets. However, it can also be found in other cells such as endothelium and smooth muscle. Therefore, we need to analyze the options carefully.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn option A, Endothelial cells, PDGF is mentioned as one of the sources, but it's not the primary source.\\r\\n\\r\\nOption B, Fibroblasts, is not relevant to the document.\\r\\n\\r\\nOption C, Macrophages, is not mentioned in the documents as a source of PDGF.\\r\\n\\r\\nOption D, Alpha granules, is actually platelets. The documents mention that PDGF is stored primarily by platelets but also found in other cells.\\r\\n\\r\\nTherefore, considering all the options and the relevant information from the documents, we can conclude that the correct answer is D: Alpha granules.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
