["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the ultrastructure of gland cells in various parts of the gallbladder. According to 'Gland ultrastructure in human gall bladder', there are antral-type glands which resemble those in the pyloric antrum of the stomach, and contain mucous cells with abundant secretory granules. The document also mentions that enterochromaffin-like cells are found in these glands but not in the glands of the neck region. Additionally, 'Ultrastructure of the human pyloric glands' describes three cell types in the pyloric glands: pyloric gland (mucous) cell, parietal cell, and endocrine cells.\n\nIt seems that there is no mention of chief cells in these documents, which suggests they may not be present in the antral-type glands described. Therefore, it is unlikely that chief cells are located within the antral-type glands or other parts of a gastric gland mentioned in this question.\n\nThe relevant document 'Morphological observations on the normal human cardiac glands' describes the secretory tubules containing mucous cells, parietal cells and endocrine cells, but does not mention chief cells. The other documents do not provide any information about chief cells or their location.\n\nBased on the available information, it is possible that chief cells are located in parts of a gastric gland other than those described in these documents. However, without further information, it is difficult to determine which part of the gastric gland chief cells may be located in.\", \n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
