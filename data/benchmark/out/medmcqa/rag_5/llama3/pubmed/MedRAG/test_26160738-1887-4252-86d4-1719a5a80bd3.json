["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about Neisseria gonorrhoeae (N. gonorrhoea). The options provided are related to N. gonorrhoeae. Option A states that N. gonorrhoea is the most common cause of urethritis in males, which is supported by the relevant documents as asymptomatic gonorrhea is significantly common in both males and females. Option B claims that all strains are highly susceptible to penicillin, but a study on selective interaction of N. gonorrhoeae and Candida albicans shows that 44% of the gonococcal isolates were resistant to inhibition by C. albicans, indicating some strains may not be fully susceptible to penicillin. Option C mentions disseminated gonococcal infection caused by widespread axoregnic stains, which is supported by the relevant documents as routine culturing of sexually active population will help control the increasing incidence of gonorrhea. Option D claims that N. gonorrhoeae is found exclusively in human beings, but it is not explicitly stated in the provided documents to confirm this. Therefore, option B seems the most likely incorrect statement.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
