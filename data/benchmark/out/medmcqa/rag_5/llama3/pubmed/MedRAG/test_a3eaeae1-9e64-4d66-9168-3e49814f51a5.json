["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"After reviewing the relevant documents, I noticed that medulloblastoma is mentioned as a type of tumor. Neuroblastoma presenting as renal cell carcinoma is also discussed. However, there is no information provided about the histomorphologic features of neuroblastoma in general, only about its presentation as renal cell carcinoma. Germ cell tumors are also mentioned, but they seem to be unrelated to this question. Therefore, I need to rely on general knowledge and medical expertise to answer this question. Based on my understanding, medulloblastoma is a type of malignant brain tumor that typically affects children, not adults. Given the patient's age (40 years old), it is unlikely that she has medulloblastoma. Neuroblastoma is another possibility, but again, it primarily affects children. Therefore, I will focus on the histomorphologic features mentioned in the documents.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
