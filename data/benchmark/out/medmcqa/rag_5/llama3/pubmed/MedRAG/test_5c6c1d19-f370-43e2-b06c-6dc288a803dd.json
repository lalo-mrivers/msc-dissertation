["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents do not provide direct information on the minimum incidence of cleft palate by ethnicity.

A study on anatomical findings in median clefts of upper lip presents cases from patients of different racial origins, but does not provide information on the minimum incidence of cleft palate.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"None of the above\""]
