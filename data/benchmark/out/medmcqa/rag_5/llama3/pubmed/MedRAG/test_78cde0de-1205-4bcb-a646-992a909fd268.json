["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks for the neonatal mortality rate based on the data from 2012. We are given the number of neonatal deaths (450), the number of stillbirths (212), and the total number of live births (12,450). To calculate the neonatal mortality rate, we need to subtract the stillbirths from the total number of live births to get the number of live births at risk. Then, we divide the number of neonatal deaths by the number of live births at risk and multiply by 1,000.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of live births at risk: 12,450 (total live births) - 212 (stillbirths) = 12,238.\n\nNow, let's calculate the neonatal mortality rate: (450 / 12,238) * 1,000.\n\nThis gives us approximately 36.64.\n\nSo, the correct answer is A: 36.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
