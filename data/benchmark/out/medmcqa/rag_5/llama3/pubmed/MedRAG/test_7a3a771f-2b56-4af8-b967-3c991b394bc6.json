["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents suggest that heparinoids are not as effective as heparin, whereas low molecular weight heparins (LMWHs) have shown impressive clinical results. Additionally, the study on molecular-weight-dependence of anticoagulant activity indicates that longer polysaccharide chains potentiate the inactivation of coagulation factors. The documents also highlight the importance of heparin binding to plasma proteins and its impact on heparin resistance. Based on these observations, it is inferred that LMWHs have reliable anticoagulant action because they have a distinct molecular weight-dependent activity, which allows for consistent clinical results.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
