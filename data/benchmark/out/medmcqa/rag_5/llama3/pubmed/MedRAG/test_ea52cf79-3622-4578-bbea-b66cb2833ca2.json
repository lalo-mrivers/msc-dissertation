["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents provided describe the postnatal development of the human temporomandibular joint (TMJ). According to 'Postnatal development of the human temporomandibular joint. I. A histological study', at birth, the temporal component was flat and was lined by vascularised connective tissue which became richer in collagen with increasing age. The cartilage layer was lacking in the fossa but was present on the tuberculum. This suggests that the TMJ develops after birth. Additionally, 'Postnatal development of the human temporomandibular joint. II. A microradiographic study' indicates that a continuous compact bony layer formed early in the fossa and tubercle while the outer mineralized layer of the condyle consisted of calcified cartilage. This also suggests that the TMJ develops after birth, but with gradual maturation.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
