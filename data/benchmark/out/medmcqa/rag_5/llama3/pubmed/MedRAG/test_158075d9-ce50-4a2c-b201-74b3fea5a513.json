["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the investigation of choice to rule out biliary atresia in a 2-month-old child. Biliary atresia is a condition that requires surgical correction. The documents provided highlight various procedures and techniques for diagnosing and treating biliary atresia, such as laparotomy, cholangiogram, liver biopsy, percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography, and porticoenterostomy procedures.\n\nConsidering the age of the child (2 months old), the most relevant information is found in 'Percutaneous cholangiography in infants.' This procedure is feasible in infants with normal-size bile ducts, including those with obstructive jaundice. Given that biliary atresia is a condition characterized by obstruction, percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography could be useful in diagnosing and ruling out the condition.\n\nHowever, ERCP (Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography) is not mentioned in the provided documents as a diagnostic tool for infants. The other options - Hepatic scintigraphy, USG, and CT scan - are also not explicitly mentioned as investigations of choice for diagnosing biliary atresia in infants.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography could be considered the investigation of choice to rule out biliary atresia in a 2-month-old child.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
