["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the modulus of elasticity of a cement that can support under complex amalgam restoration. Since we have documents related to base forming materials for dental amalgam, let's see if there are any mentions of modulus of elasticity or equivalent terms like 'strength'. We can look at the documents and identify the cements mentioned: GIC, ZnPO4, ZOE, Polycarboxylate. Then, we need to find which cement is best to support under complex amalgam restoration.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
