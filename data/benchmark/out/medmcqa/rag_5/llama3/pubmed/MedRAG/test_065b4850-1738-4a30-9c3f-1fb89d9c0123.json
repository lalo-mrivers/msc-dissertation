["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to the provided documents, alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) levels increase with age. The document 'Mean alpha-fetoprotein values of 1,333 males over 15 years by age groups' shows that average values increased with age and the upper limit (mean + 2 SD) in the over 64 years age group was close to 17 IU/ml. Additionally, another document 'Alpha-fetoprotein levels in normal adults' also shows a statistically significant increase of AFP levels with age both in men and women. Therefore, it is likely that the maximum level of alpha fetoprotein is seen in older individuals.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: Maternal serum\""]
