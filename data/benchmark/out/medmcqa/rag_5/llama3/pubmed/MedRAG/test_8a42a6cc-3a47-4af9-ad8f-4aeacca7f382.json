["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents discuss enzyme classification. The first document mentions the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry and the International Union of Biochemistry's recommendations for nomenclature and coding of enzymes. This suggests that enzyme classification is based on a standardized system. The second document talks about the classification of glycosyl hydrolases based on amino acid sequence similarities, which implies that the classification is based on the enzyme's structure or properties rather than its action on substrate or the nature of coenzymes.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
