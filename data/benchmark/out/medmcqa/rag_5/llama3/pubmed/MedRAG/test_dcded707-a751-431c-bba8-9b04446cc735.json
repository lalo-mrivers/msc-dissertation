["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents discuss the interactions between myosin heads and actin filaments. It is mentioned that myosin-induced changes in the length of actin filaments can occur. The paper 'A physical model of ATP-induced actin-myosin movement in vitro' explains that two types of cyclic interactions between myosin heads and actin are involved: productive and nonproductive. In the productive interaction, myosin heads split ATP and generate a force which produces sliding between actin and myosin. Detachment of myosin head from actin is caused by the completion of this productive cycle, i.e., when ATP is hydrolyzed.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D\n}"]
