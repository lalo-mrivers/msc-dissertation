["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the checkpoint for ZMC fracture reduction. The relevant documents describe various types of fractures, including Bennett's fracture which is a type of ZMC (zygomatico-maxillary complex) fracture. The description of compression fixation of Bennett's fracture mentions a special set of instruments that keeps the reduced fragment in position and guides the implant during internal fixation. This suggests that the checkpoint for ZMC fracture reduction is the region where the zygomatico-maxillary buttress meets, which is also mentioned as the 'Zygomatico-maxillary buttress region'.\", \"answer_choice\": C}"]
