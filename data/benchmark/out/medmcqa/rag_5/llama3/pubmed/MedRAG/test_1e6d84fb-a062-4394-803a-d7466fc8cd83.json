["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The document 'The growth of calcium phosphates on hydroxyapatite crystals. The effect of fluoride and phosphonate.' states that at low seed concentrations, dicalcium phosphate dihydrate (DCPD) is formed. Since we are looking for the percentage where DCPD cannot be rinsed off, it implies that the concentration is too low to form a basic phase, which means DCPD forms instead. The document does not provide specific percentages, but it gives an idea of how seed concentrations affect the formation of DCPD or a more basic phase.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
