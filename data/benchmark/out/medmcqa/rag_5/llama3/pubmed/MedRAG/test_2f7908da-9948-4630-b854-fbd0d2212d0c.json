["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the advantages of chromic gut over plain gut suture in deep wounds. Chromic gut has a chromic salt impregnated into it, which helps to reduce tissue reaction and promote healing. In deep wounds, this property becomes more important as the wound may be prone to prolonged bleeding or infection. Therefore, the advantage of chromic gut over plain gut is likely to be its delayed resorption, which allows for a more stable and controlled healing process.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"]
