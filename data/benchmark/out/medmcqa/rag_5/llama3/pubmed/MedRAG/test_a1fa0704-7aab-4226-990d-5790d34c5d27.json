["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the association of (gd) T cell, which refers to gamma delta T cells. We can find information about this type of T cell in the provided documents. Specifically, we can look at the document 'Antigen specificity of gamma delta T lymphocytes' where it states that gamma delta T cells are distinguished by their expression of a different set of T cell receptor genes, different distribution in normal tissues, and perhaps also different ligand specificities. This suggests that (gd) T cells have unique characteristics compared to other types of T cells. Therefore, we can look at the options provided to find the correct answer.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
