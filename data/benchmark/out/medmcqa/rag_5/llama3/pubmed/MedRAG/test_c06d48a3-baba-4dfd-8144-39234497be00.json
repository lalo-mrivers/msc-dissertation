["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the distribution plotted by a researcher from a population. The given documents are related to statistical calculations and methods, but none of them explicitly discuss plotting distributions from samples or populations. However, one document mentions 'asymptotic arc sine approximation' which could be related to sampling distributions. Another document discusses 'macrosimulation system' which is used for numerical investigations. Based on the context, it seems that the researcher is plotting a distribution of means from samples taken from the population.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
