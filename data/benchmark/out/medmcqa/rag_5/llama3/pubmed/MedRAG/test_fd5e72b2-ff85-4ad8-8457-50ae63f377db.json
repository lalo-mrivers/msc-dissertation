["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to the document 'Mantle cell lymphoma: an update', mantle cell lymphomas are characterized by the t(11;14) (q13;q32) translocation and its molecular counterpart bcl-1 rearrangement. This translocation activates a gene called BCL-1/PRAD-1. There is no mention of Cyclin DI in this document, but we know that mantle cell lymphoma can be characterized by Cyclin DI negativity. The document 'Lymphomas' mentions the diagnosis of lymphoma relies on a combination of clinical, routine histopathologic, and immunohistochemical studies, sometimes supplemented by other special techniques such as flow cytometry, DNA analysis, and gene rearrangement study. We know that mantle cell lymphoma can be characterized by bcl-1 rearrangement. We also know that SOX 11 is a marker for mantle cell lymphoma and can be especially useful in Cyclin DI negative cases.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
