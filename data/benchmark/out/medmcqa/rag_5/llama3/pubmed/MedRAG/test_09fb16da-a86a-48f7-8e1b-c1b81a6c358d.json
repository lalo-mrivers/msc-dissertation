["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the fixation period of an intrusive luxation injury. We have to look for relevant information from the provided documents. The Luxation fracture of the hip joint document mentions '4--10 years after the injury' and states that immediate diagnosis and reposition are crucial. This suggests a long-term fixation period rather than a short one like 2 weeks or 4 weeks. The Traumatic luxation of the eyeball document discusses clinical features, prognosis, and treatment but doesn't provide specific information about fixation periods. We can rule out options A and B. The remaining options C and D seem plausible. Option C suggests different fixation periods based on rigidity, which is not explicitly stated in any of the documents. However, it is possible that the authors are hinting at a longer fixation period for more severe or complex luxation injuries. Option D mentions a range of 6-8 weeks, which could be applicable to some types of luxation injuries.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
