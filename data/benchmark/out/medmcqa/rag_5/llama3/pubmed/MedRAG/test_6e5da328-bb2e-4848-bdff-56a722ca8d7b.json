["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the shelf life of a colourless, aqueous solution of suxamethonium. The provided documents are related to analytical methods for pharmaceuticals, but none of them specifically discuss suxamethonium or its shelf life. However, the document 'Physicochemical stability of a preanesthetic mixture of hydroxyzine hydrochloride and atropine sulfate' mentions studying the stability of a combination of two drugs stored in syringes, which could be relevant to understanding the shelf life of an aqueous solution of suxamethonium. The study found that the admixture was stable for ten days at room temperature or under refrigeration, but this information is not directly applicable to suxamethonium.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
