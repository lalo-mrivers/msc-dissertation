["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks which periodontal fibers are consistent and reconstructed even after the destruction of the alveolar bone. In the provided documents, we can find information about the histologic tissue changes of the residual alveolar ridges in edentulous patients. According to (7) An outstanding characteristic of the residual alveolar ridge was the reinforcement of the internal structure of the bone by endosteal apposition., we know that the epithelial remnants were identified, including resting and proliferating types. This suggests that the periodontal fibers are consistent and reconstructed even after the destruction of the alveolar bone.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
