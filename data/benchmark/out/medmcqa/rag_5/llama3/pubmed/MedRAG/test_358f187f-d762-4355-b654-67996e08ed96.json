["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for an example of transition from anterior to posterior. From the provided documents, we can see that there are cases where anterior tissue is converted to posterior or vice versa. For instance, in the document 'Targeted misexpression of Hox-4.6 in the avian limb bud causes apparent homeotic transformations', it says that the domain of expression of the Hox-4.6 gene was altered anteriorly during limb development, leading to a posterior homeotic transformation. This means that anterior tissue was converted into posterior tissue. Therefore, an example of transition from anterior to posterior is when the domain of expression of the Hox-4.6 gene is expanded anteriorly during limb development.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
