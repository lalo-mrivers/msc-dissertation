["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the instrument used for harvesting a graft from a healthy area in split thickness skin graft. The relevant documents are related to skin grafting and reconstruction. The document 'Soft tissue reconstruction with skin grafting' discusses different types of free skin grafts, including split-thickness skin grafts. It does not mention a specific instrument. The document 'Tensing and stiffening of skin grafts' suggests techniques for cutting small split thickness skin grafts, but it does not provide information about the instrument used for harvesting the graft. The document 'Optimizing the skin graft board' discusses a device that allows surgeons to cut grafts of different sizes, which is not relevant to harvesting a graft from a healthy area. The document '[Free skin grafts in plastic surgery. Transplantation techniques and indications (author's transl)]' provides general guidelines for free split and full-thickness grafts, but it does not mention the instrument used for harvesting the graft. Therefore, based on the available information, it is likely that the instrument used for harvesting a graft from a healthy area in split thickness skin graft is a dermatome.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
