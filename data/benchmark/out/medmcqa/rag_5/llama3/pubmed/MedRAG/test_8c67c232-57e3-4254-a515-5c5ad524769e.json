["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the advantage of a wide palatal bar over a narrow one. Reviewing the documents, we see that none of them directly compare narrow and wide palatal bars. However, we can look at the characteristics of arch bars and splints mentioned in the documents. In 'Esthetic arch bar for maxillomandibular fixation in orthognathic surgery', it is mentioned that traditional arch bars are made of metal to provide good rigidity. In '[Use of a monomaxillary curved splint in maxillofacial surgery]', the prefabricated monomaxillary arch has perpendicular supports, which provides dento-maxillary setting in the antero-posterior direction and also vertically. This suggests that wider bars may be able to cover more area or provide greater stability.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
