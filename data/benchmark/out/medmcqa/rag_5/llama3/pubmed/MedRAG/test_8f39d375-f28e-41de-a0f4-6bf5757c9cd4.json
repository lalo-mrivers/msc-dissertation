["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the bone(s) used for determination of growth in an individual. From the provided documents, we have information on longitudinal bone growth of the human femur and radial bone width and mineral content. The document 'Longitudinal bone growth of the human femur' states that the distal end of the femur is responsible for about 66% of the total longitudinal growth of the bone. Therefore, it seems that the femur is one of the bones used for determination of growth in an individual.\n\nThe document 'Reference values for radial bone width and mineral content using single photon absorptiometry in healthy children aged 4 to 10 years' also provides information on radial bone width and mineral content, suggesting that the radius is another bone used for determination of growth.\n\nThere is no mention of the clavicle, sternum, or mandible being used for determination of growth in an individual. Therefore, based on the provided documents, it seems that the femur and radius are the bones used for this purpose.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
