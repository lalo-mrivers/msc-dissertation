["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about Golgi tendon organ function. In the first document, it's mentioned that force applied to a muscle's tendon will straighten collagen braids and cause compressional deformation of axon branches trapped between them. This suggests that Golgi tendon organs may be detecting changes in muscle tension. Additionally, the second document mentions the activation of neurons in the dorsal column nuclei by stimulation of neck mechanoreceptors, including Golgi tendon organ afferents. This implies that Golgi tendon organs are involved in sensing forces applied to muscles. Finally, the third document discusses the physiology of primary sensory neurons innervating skeletal muscle and notes that Golgi tendon organs respond to ramp-and-hold stretches or direct muscle probing, suggesting they detect changes in muscle tension.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
