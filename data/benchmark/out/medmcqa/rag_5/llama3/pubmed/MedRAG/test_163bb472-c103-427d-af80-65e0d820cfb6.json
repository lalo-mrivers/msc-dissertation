["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The provided documents discuss the role of HOX genes in developmental genetics and congenital malformations. The studies mentioned highlight the importance of HOX genes in specifying positional identity and influencing downstream 'realizator' genes. Additionally, disruptions in HOX genes have been shown to result in defects in specific tissues and structures. Based on this information, it is likely that abnormalities in HOX gene structure and expression will soon be implicated in specific human congenital malformation syndromes.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
