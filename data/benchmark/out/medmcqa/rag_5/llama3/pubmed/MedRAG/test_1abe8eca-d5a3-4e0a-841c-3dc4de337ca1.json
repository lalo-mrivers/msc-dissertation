["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant document 'Master cone apical behavior under in vitro compaction' talks about the fitting of two brands of gutta-percha points. It mentions that warm gutta-percha compaction was associated with greater apical cone movement than lateral condensation. This information does not directly relate to the question about master apical file. Therefore, we need to consider other relevant documents. 'Endodontic diagnostic techniques' discusses the importance of a systematic routine for diagnosis. It emphasizes the role of radiographic examinations in the diagnostic process. However, this document is also irrelevant to the question. The other two documents do not provide information about master apical file either. Therefore, we need to consider the remaining options A-D.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
