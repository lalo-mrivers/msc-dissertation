["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The child has chronic liver failure and muscle weakness at 3 months of age. Serum glucose is low along with ketoacidosis and decreased pH. ALT and AST are raised. Blood lactate and uric acid levels are normal. Intravenous glucagon given after meals raises the blood glucose levels, but does not raise glucose when given after an overnight fast. Liver biopsy shows increased glycogen in liver.\n\nThis suggests that there is a defect in gluconeogenesis or glycogenolysis. The fact that glucagon administration increases blood glucose levels after meals indicates that there may be a problem with glycogen breakdown. However, the lack of increase in glucose levels after an overnight fast suggests that this might not be related to muscle phosphorylase.\n\nThe liver biopsy showing increased glycogen suggests that there is a defect in glycogenolysis. Glucose-6-phosphatase is involved in gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis. It breaks down glucose-6-phosphate into glucose, which can then be released into the bloodstream. Since glucagon administration increases blood glucose levels after meals, this suggests that glucose-6-phosphatase might be the defective enzyme.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
