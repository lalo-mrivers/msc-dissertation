["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about a drug useful for MRSA (Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus). We don't have any information from the provided documents about MRSA or antibiotics. However, we can look at the document 'Drug therapy in the elderly: the clinical pharmacology of aging' which mentions that older people have more adverse reactions to drugs than do younger people. This doesn't give us a specific answer about MRSA but rather highlights the importance of considering age and other factors when discussing drug side effects.
