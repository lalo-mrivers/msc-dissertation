["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the sensory innervation of teeth, including the pulp. The pulp is innervated by fibers from the trigeminal ganglion, which are classified as afferent nerve fibers. Afferent nerve fibers transmit information from the periphery to the central nervous system. Since the pulp is involved in transmitting pain and other sensations, it can be inferred that these afferent nerve fibers are responsible for conveying this information. However, the specific type of afferent nerve fiber (parasympathetic or sympathetic) is not specified in the documents.\", \"answer_choice\": A}"]
