["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the documents, we know that topical fluoride applications have a major effect on the demineralization and remineralization of dental hard tissues. The study 'The effect of time of exposure on fluoride uptake by human enamel from acidulated fluoride solutions in vitro' shows that topical application of acidulated fluoride solutions can lead to deposition of calcium fluoride and fluorapatite on and in enamel, which is a mechanism of action for topical fluoride. This suggests that the primary action of topical fluoride is related to its effects on dental hard tissues.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
