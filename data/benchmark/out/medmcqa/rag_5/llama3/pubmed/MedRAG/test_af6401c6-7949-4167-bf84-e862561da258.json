["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking what is NOT carried by the dorsal column. The relevant documents discuss dorsal column stimulation, which affects pain perception. From the documents, we know that dorsal column stimulation modifies appreciation of pain and can relieve chronic pain. This suggests that pain is indeed carried by the dorsal column. The other options are all sensory modalities that involve processing in the somatosensory system, which includes the dorsal column. Proprioception refers to position sense and joint proprioception, which is mediated by receptors in muscles, tendons, and joints. Vibration and touch are both forms of tactile perception that also involve the somatosensory system. Therefore, it's likely that these modalities are carried by the dorsal column.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
