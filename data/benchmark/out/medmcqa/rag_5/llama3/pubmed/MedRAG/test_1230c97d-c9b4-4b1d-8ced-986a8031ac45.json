["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about indirect ophthalmoscopy. The provided documents discuss direct ophthalmoscopy, slit lamp biomicroscopy, retinoscopy, and refractive examination, but none of them explicitly mention indirect ophthalmoscopy. However, we can make an inference based on the characteristics of direct ophthalmoscopy discussed in one of the documents. Direct ophthalmoscopy uses a high minus setting of the ophthalmoscope and an extra positive lens to increase magnification. This implies that the image is not erect. Additionally, direct ophthalmoscopy does not penetrate haze or opacity as it has limited depth penetration. Indirect ophthalmoscopy, being a different technique, may have different characteristics.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
