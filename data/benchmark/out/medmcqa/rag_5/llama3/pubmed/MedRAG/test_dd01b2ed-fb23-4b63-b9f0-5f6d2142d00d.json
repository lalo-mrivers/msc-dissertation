["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the presence of a fourth root canal in a maxillary 1st molar. The relevant document for this question is the Morphologic study of the maxillary molars. Part II: Internal anatomy. According to this study, 25% of the first molars presented four (4) root canals. The study also mentions that the incidence of two root canals in the mesiobuccal root was higher in second maxillary molars than in first maxillary molars. This suggests that the presence of a fourth canal is not typically associated with the mesiobuccal root. Similarly, it's unlikely to be present in the palatal or distal roots as these roots are less likely to have an additional canal. Therefore, the only remaining option is the mesiolingual root.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
