["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks what temperature to store medicines labeled 'store at a cool place only'. This label likely corresponds to refrigeration temperatures. The documents mention that many pharmaceutical products labeled for refrigerated storage are stable at room temperature for extended periods, which suggests that the medicine should be stored in a cooler environment. Room temperature is defined as 20-25°C, but the question does not specify this range. Therefore, we can infer that the 'cool place' likely refers to temperatures below 25°C. A: 8-15 degC and B: 2-8 degC are both within this range, making them possible answers.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
