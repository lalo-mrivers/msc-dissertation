["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 1.5-year-old child with a burn from hot water on both hands and palms. The lesion is pink, oozing, and painful to air and touch, indicating that it is likely a partial thickness or full-thickness burn. Considering the literature on hand burns, especially in the early stage, active treatment can reduce deformity and shorten treatment time. Given the patient's age and the severity of the burn, surgical intervention should be avoided as much as possible. The focus should be on promoting early healing and mobilization. The relevant document 'Treatment of 151 deeply burned hands in the early stage' emphasizes the importance of treating burns actively within the first three weeks after injury.
