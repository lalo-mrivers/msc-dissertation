["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking how to reduce working side interference. Working side interference refers to the interference caused by a distractor stimulus that is similar to the target stimulus. In the context of attention, this would refer to unattended stimuli that are processed concurrently with the attended target. The relevant documents discuss different aspects of attentional inhibition mechanisms, but do not explicitly mention working side interference. However, they do describe inhibitory mechanisms in general and how distractors can interfere with target processing.\n\nThe document 'Inhibitory mechanisms of attention: locus, stability, and relationship with distractor interference effects' discusses the concept of unattended processing and how it affects concurrent targets. The document 'Inhibitory mechanisms of attention in identification and localization tasks: time course and disruption' further explores this topic and describes how inhibition can be disrupted by less predictable intervening events.\n\nBased on these concepts, reducing working side interference would likely involve minimizing the processing of distractor stimuli that are similar to the target stimulus. This could be achieved by using guidelines or supporting mechanisms that help focus attention on the target and reduce the likelihood of unattended processing of distracting information.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
