["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"None of the provided documents mention Le-Fort 1 osteotomy or mid palatal split. However, based on the context and terminology used in the documents, it appears that a Le-Fort 1 osteotomy is a type of maxillary osteotomy that involves an anterior approach to the maxilla. This procedure is described as 'relatively simple' and provides good visualization to otherwise awkward anatomical areas. Given this information, it seems unlikely that mid palatal split would be necessary following a Le-Fort 1 osteotomy, as the procedure is typically used for correcting anteroposterior, vertical, and horizontal manifestations of maxillary excess, not for moving the palate.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: Transverse\""]
