["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe gingival recession, subgingival margins, and periodontal conditions. The question asks about the borders of major connectors adjacent to gingival crevices. Considering the information from the 'Root coverage: a comparison of techniques' document, which mentions gingival recession as a frequent concern in periodontal surgery, it is likely that the answer relates to the proximity of the connector borders to the gingival crevice. The 'Periodontal conditions in patients 5 years following insertion of fixed prostheses' document provides insight into crown margins located sub-gingivally, at the gingiva, and supra-gingivally. This information does not directly answer the question but suggests that sub-gingival placement can lead to an increase in Gingival Index scores 2 and 3, pocket depth, and loss of attachment. The 'Exposure of subgingival margins by nonsurgical gingival displacement' document describes a procedure for exposing subgingival margins, which may provide insight into the question. However, the 'The processed silicone gingival prosthesis: a simple solution to a complex problem' document does not appear relevant to this specific question. Based on the information provided, it is possible that the answer relates to the proximity of the connector borders to the gingival crevice.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
