["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to the provided documents, CpG islands are inherently resistant to de novo methylation. Additionally, conservation of specific CpG dinucleotides in promoter regions is important for regulation of gene expression. This suggests that CpG islands play a crucial role in gene regulation rather than DNA replication or synthesis.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
