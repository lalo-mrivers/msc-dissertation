["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The articular disc is a highly compliant tissue that can change volume based on condylar position. The structure and volume of the posterior attachment are functions of condylar position. This suggests that the disc may have different structures or volumes in different positions, but it does not provide information about the thickness of the disc at its center or posteriorly.

Therefore, based on the provided documents, the correct statement about the articular disc is B: Narrow in the centre.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
