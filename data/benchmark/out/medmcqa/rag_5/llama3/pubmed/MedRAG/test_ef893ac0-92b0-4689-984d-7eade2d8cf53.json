["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the primary cause of repeated fracture of a porcelain fused to metal restoration. The relevant documents discuss various aspects of porcelain-fused-to-metal restorations, including repair techniques and factors that can affect their durability. The key point to note is that the articles do not explicitly mention the reasons for repeated fracture. However, we can infer from the discussion of corrosive environment on the porcelain-to-metal bond that microcracks, flaws, and voids inside a metal-porcelain restoration may cause the restoration to fracture in service. This suggests that the primary cause of repeated fracture is likely related to the internal structure of the restoration rather than external factors.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
