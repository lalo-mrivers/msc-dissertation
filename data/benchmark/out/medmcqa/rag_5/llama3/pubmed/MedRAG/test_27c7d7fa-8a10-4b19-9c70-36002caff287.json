["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking what is NOT true about bronchial cysts. Let's analyze the options. Option A says that mostly mediastinal, but one of the case reports mentions that 3 out of 20 patients had bronchogenic cysts in the neck, not mediastinum. So, this option is likely to be correct. Option B claims that 50-70% occur in lungs, which is supported by the text as it states 'The majority of theses cysts were found within the pulmonary parenchyma' and 3 times more common on the right lung than left. Option C suggests that usually multiloculated, but none of the case reports mention this. Finally, option D says that are infected quite often, which is true as fever was a common symptom in most patients.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
