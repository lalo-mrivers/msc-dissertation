["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about extra roots in a mandibular first molar. The relevant documents are about maxillary molars and mandibular premolars and third molars. Therefore, we need to focus on the specific anatomy of mandibular first molars. According to the document 'Anatomical relationship of the mandibular canal to its surrounding structures in mature mandibles', there is no extra root mentioned for a mandibular first molar. The document 'Morphologic study of the maxillary molars' does not provide information about mandibular first molars. Document 'Pre-eruptive movements of the mandibular third molar' discusses impaction and uprighting of the third molar, but it is not relevant to extra roots in a mandibular first molar. The only document that could be potentially related is 'Ectopic eruption of a mandibular first permanent molar: report of an unusual case', which describes ectopic eruption of a mandibular left first permanent molar, but does not mention any extra root. Therefore, we need to look at other documents.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
