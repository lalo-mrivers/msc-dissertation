["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents suggest that Rh isoimmunization during pregnancy is a significant concern. The first document indicates that Rh-negative women who received Rh-positive blood and were not treated with Rho (D) immune globulin had a higher incidence of developing antibodies. The second document highlights the importance of antenatal prophylaxis in preventing Rh isoimmunization. There is no mention of exchange transfusion in these documents, so we need to look for more information.\n\nThe third document suggests that hemolytic disease of newborns can be prevented with routine postpartum administration of hyperimmune globulin to Rh-negative mothers. This does not provide specific guidance on when to perform an exchange transfusion.\n\nThe fourth document discusses the effectiveness of prophylactic Rh immunosuppression after transfusion with D-positive blood. It suggests that a dose of 20 mug of anti-Rh per milliliter of infused red cells may be effective in preventing serologic D alloimmunization, but it does not provide guidance on exchange transfusion.\n\nGiven the information provided, we can conclude that there is no specific indication for exchange transfusion mentioned in these documents. Therefore, we cannot choose an answer that includes 'exchange transfusion' as a criterion.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
