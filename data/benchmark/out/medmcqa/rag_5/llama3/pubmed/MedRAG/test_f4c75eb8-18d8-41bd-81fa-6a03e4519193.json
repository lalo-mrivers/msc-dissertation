["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the Golgi tendon organ (GTO) as a biological force transducer that functions under static loading conditions. It is proposed that force applied to a muscle's tendon will straighten collagen braids and cause compressional deformation of axon branches, which may explain how it detects forces. In the document 'Physiological properties of primary sensory neurons appropriately and inappropriately innervating skeletal muscle in adult rats', Golgi tendon organs are referred to as 'in-series receptors' that respond to ramp-and-hold stretches or direct muscle probing.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C\n}"]
