["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about materials with high compressive strength and low tensile strength. Compressive strength refers to the ability of a material to withstand pressure or crushing forces. Tensile strength, on the other hand, refers to the ability of a material to withstand stretching or pulling forces. Since the question asks for a classification based on these properties, we can infer that it is related to how materials respond to different types of stresses. The compressive strength indicates the material's resistance to pressure, while the low tensile strength suggests that the material may not be able to withstand stretching or pulling forces well.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
