["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Firstly, we need to identify the relevant information from the provided documents. After reviewing the documents, we can see that there is no mention of cysts associated with vital teeth in the general context of jaw cysts or dental abscesses. However, the document 'Squamous odontogenic tumorlike proliferations in odontogenic cysts' mentions that the lesions showed no more aggressive potential than the cysts, if taken alone, in which they occurred. This suggests that the cysts were associated with vital teeth. Additionally, the document 'The calcifying odontogenic cyst: report of case' also discusses a cyst associated with a vital tooth.
