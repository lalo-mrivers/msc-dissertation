["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Since the question is about IV diazepam effects on a patient on a dental chair, I will review the provided documents. From 'Sedation for outpatient conservative dentistry', I see that IV diazepam was used in combination with local analgesic block and pentazocine supplementation.
