["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe prions as an abnormal isoform of a host-encoded protein. There is no mention of prions being composed of DNA/RNA, so option D can be ruled out. Prions are not readily inactivated by autoclave at 121oC, as they are resistant to heat and other denaturing agents. Additionally, there is no evidence of strong immunogenic reactions in response to prion infections. The incubation periods for prion diseases are typically long, ranging from years to decades. Therefore, options A, B, and C can be eliminated, leaving the correct answer as\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"None of the above\"\n}"]
