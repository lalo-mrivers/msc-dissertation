["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents discuss different aspects of brain function and anatomy. The first document mentions dominant language functions of the right hemisphere, which suggests that this hemisphere has a role in modulating affective components of speech. The second document discusses cerebral hemispheric asymmetry in humans and finds evidence for a higher percentage of persons with right-sided cerebral representation for speech than previously assumed. The third document describes neuronal activity in frontal speech area 44 during word recognition, which is relevant to language processing. The fourth document provides information on the distribution of cortical neurofibrillary tangles in progressive supranuclear palsy and contrasts it with Alzheimer's disease.\n\nThe question asks about the maximum area in homunculus, which refers to the representation of body parts in the brain. The homunculus is a model that maps different body areas onto corresponding areas in the motor cortex. A higher maximum area in the homunculus would indicate greater representational power for the corresponding body part.\n\nConsidering these points, I think the correct answer is C: Increased precisiveness of movements.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
