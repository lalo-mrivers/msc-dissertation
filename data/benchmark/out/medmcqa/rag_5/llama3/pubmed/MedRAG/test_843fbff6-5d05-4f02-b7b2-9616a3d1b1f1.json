["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the human response to thermal environments, including internal heat production, and how it maintains a narrow range of internal body temperatures (36-38 C). The documents also discuss physiological responses such as peripheral vasoconstriction, increased heat production by shivering, and sweating for evaporative cooling. Additionally, they mention that repeated exposures to heat, humidity, and exercise can modify the physiological response mechanisms through acclimation.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
