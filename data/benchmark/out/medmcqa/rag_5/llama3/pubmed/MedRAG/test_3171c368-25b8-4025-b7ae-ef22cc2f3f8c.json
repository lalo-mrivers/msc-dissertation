["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about post-transcriptional modifications of RNA. The given options are A-D. Splicing is a process where introns are removed from the pre-mRNA and exons are joined together to form mature mRNA (A). 5' capping and 3' polyadenylation are also processes that occur during post-transcriptional modification of RNA, adding a cap structure to the 5' end and a string of adenine nucleotides to the 3' end respectively. Glycosylation is not related to RNA processing.\",\n\"answer_choice\": A"]
