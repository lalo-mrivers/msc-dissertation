["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the effect of radiation. From the provided documents, I can see that radiation has been studied with regards to its effects on cells, including HeLa cells (Potentiation of radiation effects in hypoxic HeLa cells). This study shows that radiation effects can be potentiated or counteracted by manipulating postirradiation conditions. Additionally, Radiation: how real are the risks? mentions that the risk from ionising radiations has recently been identified as being greater than it was previously thought to be. Considering these points, I think the effect of radiation is likely fractionalized.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
