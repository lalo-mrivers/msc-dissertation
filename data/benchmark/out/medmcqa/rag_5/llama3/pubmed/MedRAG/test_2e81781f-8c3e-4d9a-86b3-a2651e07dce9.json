["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the areas where blood brain barrier is absent. From the provided documents, it can be seen that the blood-brain barrier separates the central nervous system from systemic blood circulation by a continuous capillary network. The document 'Blood-brain barrier and treatment of central nervous system tumors' states that the barrier's permeability within brain tumors is different with fenestrated endothelium resembling that of normal brain regions outside the BBB. This suggests that the blood-brain barrier is intact in normal brain regions, but may be disrupted in certain areas such as brain tumors. The document 'Blood-brain barrier and new approaches to brain drug delivery' mentions strategies for selectively increasing blood-brain barrier permeability in brain tumors without affecting barrier permeability in normal brain tissue. This further supports the idea that the blood-brain barrier is intact in normal brain regions.\n\nThe options provided are areas within the brain, but it is not clear which of these areas would have an absent or disrupted blood-brain barrier. The document 'The blood-brain barrier and cerebral microcirculation in Alzheimer disease' mentions that there is evidence suggesting breakdown of the BBB in certain areas, such as cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), which may be associated with Alzheimer's disease. However, this does not directly answer the question.\n\nAfter carefully reading through the documents and considering the information provided, it appears that the blood brain barrier is absent in all of the following areas except...\",\n\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
