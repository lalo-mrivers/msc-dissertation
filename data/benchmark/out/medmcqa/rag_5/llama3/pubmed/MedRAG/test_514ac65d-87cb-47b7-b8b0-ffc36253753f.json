["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking which technique is used to move the tongue away from the post pharyngeal wall. None of the provided options are directly related to the topic of lateral pharyngeal wall displacement or oropharynx management. However, one of the documents (Partial horizontal supraglottic laryngectomy) mentions a method of reconstruction that involves lining the raw surface of the transected base of the tongue with a pedicle flap. This technique would allow the organ to remain in a position capable of occluding the glottis during deglutition, and at the same time guiding the food along the posterior pharyngeal wall and into the esophagus. Therefore, it is likely that this method of reconstruction is used to move the tongue away from the post pharyngeal wall.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"None of the above\""]
