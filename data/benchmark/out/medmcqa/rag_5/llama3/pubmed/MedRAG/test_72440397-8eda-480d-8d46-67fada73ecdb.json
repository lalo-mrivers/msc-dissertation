["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the characteristics of the masseter muscle. The Unilateral enlargement of the masseter muscle document states that benign hypertrophy of the masseter muscle is a relatively uncommon condition which may occur unilaterally or bilaterally. The Masticatory muscle fatigue and The orderly recruitment of motor units of the masseter and temporal muscles during voluntary isometric contraction in man documents describe the physiology of the masseter muscle, including its ability to generate sustained bite forces and its motor unit firing patterns. None of these documents suggest that the multipennate arrangement of fibers, bipennate arrangement of fibers, random arrangement of fibers, or circumpennate arrangement of fibers are characteristics of the masseter muscle.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
