["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant document that talks about the Michaelis constant is 'Estimation of Michaelis constant and maximum velocity from the direct linear plot'. According to this document, the Michaelis constant (Km) represents the substrate concentration at half-maximal velocity. This is because bias can arise in the final estimates if any pairs lead to negative values of the maximum velocity V. By treating such negative values as if they were large and positive, and by treating the corresponding values of Km in the same way, we can remove this bias.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
