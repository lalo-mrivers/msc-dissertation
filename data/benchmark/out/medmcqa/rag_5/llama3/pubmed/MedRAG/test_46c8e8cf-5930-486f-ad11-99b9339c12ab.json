["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the provided documents, we can see that reticular fibers are characterized by their staining pattern with ammoniacal silver reduction, which is globular in form having a wide variety of particle sizes. This characteristic staining pattern distinguishes them from collagenous fibers. Additionally, fibronectin is distributed similarly to reticulin, but the distribution of fibronectin is distinct from that of collagen and elastic fibers.\n\nReticular fibers are mentioned to perform a specific function in maintaining the structural-functional integrity of connective tissue by preventing connective tissue fibers and collagen fibrils from approaching or dissociating each other. This function is mainly performed at the level of fibers, as opposed to amorphous substance which performs this function at the level of fibrils.\n\nThe document on elastotic degeneration does not provide specific information about reticular fibers in different tissues.\n\nBased on our analysis, we can conclude that reticular fibers are present in all collagen tissues. Therefore, we need to analyze the options provided to see if any of them contain collagen tissue.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
