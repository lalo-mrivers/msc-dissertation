["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the management of a patient with renal laceration and urinoma after blunt trauma. The patient has been stable for 12 days without fever. Considering the documents provided, particularly the one on 'Renal abscess in healthy children', it seems that the focus is on managing the urinary fistula rather than infection. This rules out antibiotic treatment as a primary approach.\n\nThe option B 'Wait and watch' seems to be an inadequate management strategy given the persistence of urinoma after 12 days.\n\nOptions C and D both involve intervention in the urinary system, but only one deals with the urinoma directly.\n\nConsidering the case report on 'Urinoma, a case report with unusual presentation', it is clear that prompt management of urinoma can prevent complications. Given this information, I would choose option D 'Percutaneous nephrostomy' as the next step in management, as it directly addresses the persisting urinoma and minimizes potential complications.\n\nTherefore, my answer is: D\", \n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
