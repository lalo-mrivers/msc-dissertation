["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant document is [Study of properties of electrical root canal length measuring instruments]. This study mentions the types of apex locators available, including resistance-type, impedance-type, and frequency-based units. The impedance-type unit requires careful calibration before use, careful matching of the coated probe to the canal diameter, and good patient contact with the hand-held return electrode.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
