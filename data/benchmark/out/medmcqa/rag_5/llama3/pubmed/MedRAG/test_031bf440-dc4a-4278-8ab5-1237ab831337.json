["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant information comes from the documents 'Cements for permanent luting: a summarizing review' and 'The properties of four dental cements'. Both zinc oxide eugenol cement and polycarboxylate cement are mentioned in these documents. The key point is that both materials have similar retentive properties, as stated in 'The properties of four dental cements': 'Tests on 4 cements showed no significant difference in the retentive property of zinc phosphate and polycarboxylate cements but significant differences existed between these and two zinc oxide eugenol (modified) materials.' This suggests that both cements have a similar ability to retain restorations, which is the common factor.\", \"answer_choice\": B}"]
