["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks for good prognostic factors for ALL (Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia). The given documents are related to medical care, quality of performance, and patient characteristics. However, none of the provided documents explicitly discuss ALL or its prognosis.\n\nTo answer this question, we need to rely on external knowledge. According to various medical sources, good prognostic factors for ALL include age of onset between 2-8 years (favourable), initial WBC count less than 50,000 (favourable), hyperdiploidy (favourable), and t(9;22), t(8;14), t(4;11) (unfavourable).\n\nBased on this information, the correct answer is option D: t (9 : 22), t (8 : 14), t (4 : 11). These genetic translocations are associated with poor prognosis in ALL.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
