["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks for recognized manifestations of acute Rheumatic fever. We can look at the provided documents to find the answer. In the document 'Rheumatic fever in adult patients', it is mentioned that carditis appeared to be rather benign: at the acute stage no patient developed congestive heart failure or any other serious complication. Five patients had erythema marginatum, but we saw no chorea or subcutaneous nodules. This suggests that chorea and subcutaneous nodules are not typical manifestations of acute Rheumatic fever in adults. The document 'Diagnosis of rheumatic fever' also mentions the disease as having visceral form (carditis rheumatica, chorea minor) or as peripheral manifestation (acute polyarthritis, erythema anulare, subcutaneous nodules, purpura rheumatica). This suggests that carditis and polyarthritis are more common manifestations of Rheumatic fever. The document 'Articular manifestations of rheumatic fever in adults' also mentions the joint disease as being abrupt in onset, rapidly additive, and eventually symmetrical, with a lower-extremity, large-joint predominance. Therefore, abdominal pain is not a recognized manifestation of acute Rheumatic fever. Epistaxis is also not mentioned as a manifestation in any of the documents. Hence, the correct answer would be a combination of 'a' (Abdominal pain) and 'b' (Epistaxis).\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: ab\"\n}"]
