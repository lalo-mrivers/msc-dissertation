["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the quadruple test for antenatal detection of Down syndrome. The relevant documents are about serum tumor markers, but none of them specifically mention the quadruple test or its components. However, one of the documents mentions human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) as a standard biomarker of pregnancy. We can infer that ss-hCG is likely related to hCG. Additionally, Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) is mentioned in one of the documents as a tumor marker used for monitoring therapy and detecting relapse. Inhibin is not mentioned at all in any of the provided documents. Estradiol is not typically considered a tumor marker or a component of the quadruple test.\n\nBased on this information, we can conclude that Inhibin is the most likely correct answer.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
