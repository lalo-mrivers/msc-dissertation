["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the properties and characteristics of different dental cements. The question asks which component gives the strength to zinc oxide-eugenol cement. We can look at the document 'A rationale for use of bases with amalgam restorations' where it mentions the development of new lining materials from calcium hydroxide, zinc oxide-eugenol, and glass ionomers. It does not provide information on the components that give strength to these cements. However, we can look at another document 'Examination of the test for compressive strength applied to zinc oxide eugenol cements' which provides some insight into the properties of zinc oxide-eugenol cement. According to this document, removal of a small number of outlying low results converts the distribution of compressive strength results for a zinc oxide eugenol cement to a normal one. Crosshead speed and friction at the anvil have no significant effect on results, but compressive strength is a function of the diameter-length ratio of the cylinder and increases with this ratio. This suggests that the material itself (zinc oxide) plays a role in its strength.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
