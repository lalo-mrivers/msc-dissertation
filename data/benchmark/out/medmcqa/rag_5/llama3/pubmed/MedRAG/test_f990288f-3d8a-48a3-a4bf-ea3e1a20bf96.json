["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the source of estrogen secretion in females. The relevant documents mention inhibin-like immunoreactivity being produced and secreted by human adrenal glands, but this is not directly related to estrogen. The document on 'Adrenogenital syndrome: unusual presentation in an adult' mentions androgens being elaborated from adrenal or adrenal rest sources, which suggests that the adrenal gland can produce androgens. However, it does not specifically mention estrogen secretion.\n\nThe study on 'Properties of immunoreactive estradiol secreted by adrenals and ovaries of immature female rats' shows that both adrenals and ovaries of 15-day-old animals secrete approximately equal amounts of immunoreactive estradiol, with thin-layer chromatogram of immunoreactive material being identical for both glands. This suggests that the adrenal gland can produce estrogen.\n\nThe document on 'Control of adrenal androgen secretion' mentions the production and release of inhibin-like immunoreactivity in response to ACTH, but it does not specifically discuss estrogen secretion.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the provided documents, it appears that the adrenal gland is a source of estrogen secretion in females.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
