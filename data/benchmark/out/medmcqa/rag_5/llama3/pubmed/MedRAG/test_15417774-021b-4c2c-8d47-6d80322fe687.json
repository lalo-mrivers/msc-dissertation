["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about a malignant pustule. In the relevant documents, there is a mention of 'cutaneous manifestations of malignant disease' which suggests that some skin lesions are related to internal malignancy. The document 'Cutaneous signs of internal malignant disease' also emphasizes nonspecific cutaneous changes associated with malignancy. There is no mention of actinomycosis or anthrax in these documents, but it does discuss pustular nodules and lymphocutaneous sporotrichosis.
