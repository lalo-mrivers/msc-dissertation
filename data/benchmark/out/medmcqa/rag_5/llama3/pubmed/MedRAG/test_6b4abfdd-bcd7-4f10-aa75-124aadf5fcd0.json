["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, we need to convert the patient's required dose of ceftriaxone (180 mg) into milliliters. The concentration of ceftriaxone is 500 mg/5ml. To find the number of milliliters needed, we can divide the patient's dose by the concentration: 180 mg / (500 mg/5ml). This gives us 1.8 ml.
