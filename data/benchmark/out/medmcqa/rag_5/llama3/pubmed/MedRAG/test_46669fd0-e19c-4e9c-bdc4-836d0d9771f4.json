["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the provided documents, it can be inferred that bisphosphonates are antiresorptive agents that decrease the frequency of osteoclast activation or depth of osteoclast resorption. This is supported by the review of the cellular mechanism of action of bisphosphonates which mentions that bisphosphonates appear to involve the osteoclast at more than one stage of its maturation process, suggesting that they may inhibit osteoclast-mediated resorption.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
