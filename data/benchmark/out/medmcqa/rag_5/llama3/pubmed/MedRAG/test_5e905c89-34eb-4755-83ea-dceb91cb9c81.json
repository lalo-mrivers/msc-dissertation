["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the force needed for intrusion of four mandibular anterior teeth. We can find relevant information from the provided documents. In 'Deep overbite correction by intrusion', we learn that six principles must be considered in incisor or canine intrusion, including the use of optimal magnitudes of force and the delivery of this force constantly with low-load-deflection springs. This suggests that the amount of force needed for intrusion is important. The article 'The effectiveness of differential moments in establishing and maintaining anchorage' discusses controlling intraoral anchorage, which might be related to the amount of force needed for intrusion.\n\nHowever, we can't find a specific mention of the force needed for intrusion of four mandibular anterior teeth in these documents. Therefore, we must rely on general principles and expert opinion. The document 'A practical approach to orthodontic treatment for the adult patient' states that proper treatment can bring about improvements in most cases but it is neither necessary nor advisable to attempt a complete correction of all irregularities. This suggests that the goal is often to achieve a acceptable result rather than a perfect one.\n\nGiven these principles and expert opinions, we might infer that the amount of force needed for intrusion could be relatively moderate, as overcorrection is not desirable. We can compare this with other documents or general knowledge about orthodontic treatment. For example, in 'Vertical control: a multifactorial problem and its clinical implications', we learn that some patients require intrusion of the anterior teeth, while others require primarily extrusion. This could imply that the amount of force needed for intrusion might vary depending on individual patient characteristics.\n\nTherefore, our answer choice should be moderate, reflecting the importance of optimal magnitudes of force and the need to avoid overcorrection.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B: 100gm\""]
