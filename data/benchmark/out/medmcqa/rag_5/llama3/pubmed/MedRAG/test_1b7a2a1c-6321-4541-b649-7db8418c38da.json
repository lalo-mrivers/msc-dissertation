["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the activity of various cephalosporins against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. According to the first document, imipenem, aztreonam, and ceftazidime were active against most P. aeruginosa strains. In the second document, a series of N-acylated phenylglycine cephalosporins are described, which exhibit activity against some strains of Pseudomonas aeruginoa. The third document describes CI-867, a new semisynthetic penicillin that shows promising antibacterial activity against Pseudomonas and other Gram-negative bacteria. Finally, the last document discusses cephalosporin antibiotics in general, including their use against certain bacterial infections.\n\nThe key finding is that some cephalosporins are active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, but not all of them. Imipenem, aztreonam, and ceftazidime were mentioned as being active against most P. aeruginosa strains, while ciprofloxacin exhibited poor activity.\n\nTherefore, based on the available information, the cephalosporin that is likely to be active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa is one of those three.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
