["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents mention various patient populations that may be affected by infective endocarditis. Prosthetic valve endocarditis is a serious complication of valve replacement, which suggests that patients with prosthetic heart valves are at risk. The document on infective endocarditis also mentions elderly persons as a specific population. None of the other options (ASD, VSD, PDA, pulmonary stenosis) are mentioned in the context of infective endocarditis. Therefore, it is most likely that patients with valvular or congenital heart disease, including those with prosthetic valves and elderly persons, are at risk of developing infective endocarditis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
