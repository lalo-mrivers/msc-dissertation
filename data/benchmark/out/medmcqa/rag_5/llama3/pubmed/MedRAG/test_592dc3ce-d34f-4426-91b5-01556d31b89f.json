["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks which of the given options is NOT expressed on the surface of T-cells at some stage of development. The provided documents describe the development of different lineages of T cells within the thymus, including the expression of CD3, CD4, and CD8 markers. It is also mentioned that the most mature thymocyte precursor population not yet expressing T lineage-specific surface markers (i.e. CD3, CD4, and CD8) is capable of generating TcR-alpha beta T cells. There is no mention of CDIa, PAX5, or CD 34 being expressed on the surface of T-cells.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
