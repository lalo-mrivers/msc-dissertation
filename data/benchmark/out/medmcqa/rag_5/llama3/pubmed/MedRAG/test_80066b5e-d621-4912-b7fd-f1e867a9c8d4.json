["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The provided documents discuss nutritional management of renal disease, particularly chronic kidney disease (CKD). In patients with CKD, dietary restrictions are necessary to prevent adverse effects. The key principle is to restrict protein intake to reduce morbidity and slow the progression of disease. The documents do not explicitly mention renal feed for CKD patients, but they do provide general guidelines for nutritional management. Based on these guidelines, we can infer that a low-protein diet would be recommended. This implies a high calorie low volume approach.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C: High calorie low volume\"\n}"]
