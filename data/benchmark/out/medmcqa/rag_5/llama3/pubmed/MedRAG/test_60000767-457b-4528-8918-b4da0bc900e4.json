["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the provided documents, we can see that high-copper amalgam alloys have been studied for their characteristics. The study 'The influence of final mercury content on the characteristics of a high-copper amalgam' shows that as the Hg content is increased, creep and Sn in gamma1 exhibit a sudden increase. This suggests that high copper amalgams may have higher creep compared to low-copper alloys.\n\nIn addition, the study 'Behavior of three high-Cu amalgams' investigates the creep behavior of high-Cu alloys and finds a sudden creep increase at approximately 46% final Hg content, which is associated with the initiation of the Sn--Hg phase (gamma 2).\n\nThe study 'Diametral tensile strength of twenty-three hardened commercial amalgams' does not mention compressive strength or marginal breakdown directly, but it suggests that the introduction of \"dispersion\" alloys did not change the dental picture as to the property of tensile strength.\n\nFinally, the study 'A 14-year clinical assessment of 12 amalgam alloys' compares the clinical performance of different amalgam alloys and finds that high-copper alloys exhibited better clinical performance, including less marginal fracture, compared to traditional low-copper materials.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
