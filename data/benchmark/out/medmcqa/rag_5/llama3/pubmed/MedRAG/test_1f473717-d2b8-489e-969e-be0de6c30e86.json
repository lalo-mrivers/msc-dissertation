["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents discuss the metabolism of collagen, the structure of collagen, and methods for estimating the ratio of collagen type III to type I. The question asks about the amino acid used in the estimation of collagen. In the method proposed by A simple method for quantitative estimation of collagen type III to type I ratio in soft tissues, the ratio Gly/Ala is determined in pure collagen samples obtained from pepsin digests of the tissues. This suggests that glycine (Gly) is used as an amino acid in the estimation of collagen.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
