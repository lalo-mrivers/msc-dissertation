["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents discuss the synthesis of porphyrins related to uroporphyrin-III and their metabolism to protoporphyrin-IX by haemolysates. This suggests that the pathway for haem degradation is intramolecular, involving a haem-oxygen complex. The document on haem biosynthesis also discusses the preferred pathway of degradation of uro'gen-III to coproporphyrinogen-III, indicating a clockwise sequence of decarboxylation reactions. This information does not directly address the question about which TCA intermediate is used in haem synthesis. However, one of the documents on haem biosynthesis mentions that hepta- and hexa-carboxylic porphyrinogen intermediates are metabolized to protoporphyrin-IX by haemolysates. This suggests that alpha-keto glutarate could be an intermediate involved in haem synthesis, as it is a decarboxylation product of succinyl-CoA.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
