["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the formation of granulation tissue as an early stage of wound healing. According to 'Time-dependent appearance of myofibroblasts in granulation tissue of human skin wounds', alpha-smooth muscle actin-positive myofibroblasts appear with the initial formation of typical granulation tissue, which can be seen around 5 days after wounding. Since the boy had a cut 4 days ago and granulation tissue has already formed, it is likely that this granulation tissue contains alpha-smooth muscle actin-positive myofibroblasts. Therefore, we can look at the 'Wound healing' paper to find the type of collagen associated with myofibroblasts.\", \"answer_choice\": C}"]
