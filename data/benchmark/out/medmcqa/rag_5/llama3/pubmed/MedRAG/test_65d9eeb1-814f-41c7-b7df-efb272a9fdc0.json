["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant document is [Bending strength in modeling materials]. According to the document, it describes the bending strength and modulus of elasticity of 15 materials. It mentions that 9 of them were hard plasters. To answer the question about what model plaster (white) used to cast study models before mixing with water is largely composed of, we can look at the common components of hard plasters. Calcium carbonate (CaCO3) is a common component of hard plasters.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
