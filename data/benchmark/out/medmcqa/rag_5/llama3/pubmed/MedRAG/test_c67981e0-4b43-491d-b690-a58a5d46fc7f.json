["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"There is no information provided in the given documents that directly relates to the direction of force by Class III elastic in a face mask. However, we can look at the case reports and studies presented. In 'Use of the face mask in the treatment of maxillary retrusion--a case report', it does not mention anything about the direction of force. In 'A comparison of lower face changes', there is no information provided about Class III elastic mechanics specifically. In 'A mathematical model for the computation of the forces exerted by the facial orthopedic mask', the study presents a model for the computation of forces but does not provide information about the direction of force by Class III elastic in a face mask. Finally, in 'Chain saw vs. face: another hazard of mechanized progress' and 'The transparent face mask', there is no relevant information provided. Therefore, we can only eliminate answer choices that are clearly incorrect based on the given documents.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
