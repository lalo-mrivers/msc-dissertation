["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the first radiographic sign of chronic pulpal infection of primary molars. The relevant documents are related to pulp involvement in teeth, endodontic therapy, and periapical diseases. After reviewing the documents, I found that most central bony lesions appearing in a periapical location are inflammatory in nature secondary to pulpal degeneration (Diagnosing Inflammatory and Non-inflammatory Periapical Disease). This suggests that chronic pulpal infection can lead to periapical bony changes. Therefore, the first radiographic sign of chronic pulpal infection of primary molars is likely to be Periapical bony changes.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
