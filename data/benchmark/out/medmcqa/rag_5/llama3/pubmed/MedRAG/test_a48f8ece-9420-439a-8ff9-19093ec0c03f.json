["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents discuss childhood fear and anxiety states related to dental treatment. The first document highlights that excessively fearful child patients often have a history of untoward dental and medical experiences which might have been prevented. This suggests that the child's experience may be contributing to their fear, rather than any specific aspect of the dental visit. The second document discusses children's expectations and recollections of discomfort associated with dental treatment, but does not specifically address 2-year-old children or their first visit to the dentist. The third document talks about attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder in children, which is not relevant to this question. The fourth document reviews the management of anxiety in children as dental patients, discussing various psychological concepts and strategies for managing fear. However, it does not provide specific information on 2-year-old children or their first visit to the dentist. Finally, the last document highlights the diversity of family structures and emphasizes that there is no typical family. Considering these points, we can deduce that the child's fear during his first visit to the dentist is likely related to separation from the parent.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
