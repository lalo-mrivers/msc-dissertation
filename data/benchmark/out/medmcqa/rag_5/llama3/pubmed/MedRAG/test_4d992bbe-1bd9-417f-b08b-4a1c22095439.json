["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about mother to children's transmission. The relevant documents describe the selective transmission of human immunodeficiency virus type-1 variants from mothers to infants. It states that the infants' viral sequences were less diverse than those of their mothers, and a conserved N-linked glycosylation site within the V3 region was absent in all of the infants' sequence sets. These findings demonstrate that a minor subset of maternal virus is transmitted to the infant. This suggests that there may be a selective transmission mechanism at play.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C\n}"]
