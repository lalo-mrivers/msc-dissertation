["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Antigenic drift refers to gradual changes over time. Influenza viruses have two surface antigens: hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA).

The mechanism of antigenic drift is usually attributed to selection of preexisting mutants by pressure from increasing immunity in the human population.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
