["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking which of the following options is not required for protein synthesis of eukaryotes. The relevant documents provided are Mechanism and regulation of eukaryotic protein synthesis, Basics of magnetic resonance phenomenon, The single-nucleotide addition cycle in transcription: a biophysical and biochemical perspective, and Proofreading, NTPases and translation: constraints on accurate biochemistry. None of the mentioned documents have information about RNA polymerase as it is related to transcription not protein synthesis. Ribosomes are required for protein synthesis. Peptidyl transferase is also part of ribosomes' function during elongation phase of translation. Amino acyl tRNA synthetase is not directly involved in eukaryotic protein synthesis. Therefore, the correct answer is D: Amino acyl tRNA synthetase.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
