["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks for all true statements about paracetamol poisoning except one. We can start by analyzing the given documents. From 'Acetaminophen: report of an unusual poisoning', we know that patients can appear moderately ill with an enlarged liver and still recover. From 'Acute acetaminophen intoxication', we learn that N-acetylcysteine (NAC) is effective in treating overdose cases. 'Liver toxicity after acetaminophen ingestion' suggests that plasma or serum acetaminophen levels are a better index of risk than the dose estimate, and that antidotal therapy should be given early. 'Hepatotoxicity of paracetamol enhanced by ingestion of alcohol: report of two cases' mentions the increased susceptibility of alcoholic patients to paracetamol hepatotoxicity. Finally, 'A theoretical approach to the management of paracetamol overdosage' discusses the role of glutathione depletion and the potential for treatments that interfere with oxidation or block attachment to hepatic tissue.\n\nConsidering these documents, we can identify some true statements about paracetamol poisoning: patients may appear asymptomatic for 24-30 hours before symptoms develop (as suggested in 'Acetaminophen: report of an unusual poisoning'); NAC is effective treatment (from 'Acute acetaminophen intoxication'); and plasma or serum acetaminophen levels are a better index of risk than dose estimate (from 'Liver toxicity after acetaminophen ingestion').\n\nOn the other hand, we can exclude statements that are not supported by the provided documents. For instance, there is no evidence to suggest that 10 mg is a safe dose for paracetamol poisoning. Additionally, acetylcysteine does not block glutathione in paracetamol poisoning (according to 'A theoretical approach to the management of paracetamol overdosage').\n\nIn conclusion, the true statements about paracetamol poisoning are that patients may appear asymptomatic for 24-30 hours before symptoms develop, NAC is effective treatment, and plasma or serum acetaminophen levels are a better index of risk than dose estimate. The statements that are not supported by the provided documents are: 10 mg is safe dose; and acetylcysteine blocks glutathione in paracetamol poisoning.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
