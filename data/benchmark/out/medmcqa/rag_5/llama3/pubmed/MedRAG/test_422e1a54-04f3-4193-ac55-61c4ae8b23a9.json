["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents discuss the mechanism of haem degradation, metals regulating heme metabolism, and spectral properties of nonequilibrium states in cytochrome P-450. However, there is no mention of an intermediate of the Krebs cycle used in heme synthesis. The only reference to the Krebs cycle is a brief mention of energy generation and oxidative biotransformations, which are functions that heme proteins like cytochrome P-450 catalyze. Therefore, we must look at the choices provided.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
