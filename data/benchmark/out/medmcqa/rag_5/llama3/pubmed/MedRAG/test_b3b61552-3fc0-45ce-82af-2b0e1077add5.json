["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the type of mandibular fracture management using mini plates. Based on the provided documents, it can be seen that the use of miniplates for mandibular fractures is a form of fixation, which implies a degree of stability and rigidity. The text also mentions that the 2.0 mm titanium miniplate system provides increased stability compared to traditional miniplate systems. This suggests that the management adapts rigid osteosynthesis principles. Therefore, the correct answer is D: Rigid osteosynthesis.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
