["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The electrical axis of the heart is defined as the mean frontal-plane axis of the QRS complex. The axis is related to age and body build. In this case, the ECG shows a mean axis of 90 degrees. Since the reference texts do not provide specific information about the relationship between the electrical axis and R wave voltage at a given angle, we need to consider other relevant documents. We know that advancing age leads to rightward and superior displacement of the ST segment in orthogonal electrocardiograms. This suggests that older subjects may have a greater positive R wave amplitude in lead III compared to other leads. Therefore, it is possible that the maximum voltage of R wave would be present in lead III.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
