["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the relevant documents, we know that the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) has a synovial membrane lining the nonarticulating surfaces within the joint capsule. In the document 'Innervation of the temporomandibular joint', it is mentioned that the TMJ in transverse and longitudinal section was found to have two types of mechanoreceptors, one of capsular form approximately 40 times 200 mum innervated by myelinated nerve fibres 8 mum in diameter. This suggests that the sensory nerve supply of the capsule of TMJ is likely related to this type of mechanoreceptor.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
