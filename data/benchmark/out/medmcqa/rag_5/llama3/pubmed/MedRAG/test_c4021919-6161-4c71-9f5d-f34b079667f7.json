["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for Young's formula to calculate pediatric dose of a drug. The relevant documents provide information on pediatric dosing considerations in ophthalmology and pharmacokinetics. The first document mentions an equation that predicts equal areas under aqueous humor concentration-time profiles by administering a dose to infants which is some fraction of the normal adult dose. This fraction is obtained by dividing the aqueous humor volume of the child by that of the adult. The second document discusses pediatric clinical pharmacology and highlights the importance of individualized dosing in pediatric patients. The third document emphasizes the need for specific dosing guidelines and dosage forms for pediatric patients. Finally, the fourth document discusses pediatric pharmacokinetics and therapeutic drug monitoring, which also supports the concept of individualized dosing.\n\nBased on these documents, it appears that Young's formula is related to the aqueous humor volume ratio between children and adults. The equation mentioned in the first document suggests that a dose for an infant can be calculated by dividing its aqueous humor volume by that of an adult, then multiplying by the normal adult dose. This result matches option B: Age / 20 x Adult dose.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
