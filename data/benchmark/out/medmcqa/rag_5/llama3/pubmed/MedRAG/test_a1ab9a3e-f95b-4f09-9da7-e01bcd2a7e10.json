["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Understanding the classification of degenerative arthritis, we can identify that abnormal concentrations of force on cartilage lead to its development. This suggests that it is a mechanical process rather than an idiopathic one. The question asks about diarthroses type of joint. Diarthroses are characterized by the presence of a synovial fluid-filled space between the articulating bones, which allows for movement. Considering the classification of temporomandibular joint osteoarthrosis and internal derangement, we can see that it is a diarthrotic joint. Similarly, in the pattern of joint involvement in hands with arthritis at the base of the thumb, we can infer that the carpometacarpal joint of the thumb is also a diarthrotic joint.
