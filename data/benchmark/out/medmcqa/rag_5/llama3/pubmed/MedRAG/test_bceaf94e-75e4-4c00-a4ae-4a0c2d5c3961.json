["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the wedgeing method to be used for a buccolingual wide proximal box. The relevant information comes from the 'Radiographic assessment of proximal infrabony pocket topography' document, which describes methods for determining the topography of interproximal infrabony pocket lesions. This document does not provide information on wedgeing methods for treating buccolingual wide proximal boxes. Therefore, we must look at other relevant documents. The 'Localization of anatomic structures before endodontic surgery with tomograms' document describes the use of tomograms to demonstrate the location of root apices relative to adjacent anatomic structures. This document does not provide information on wedgeing methods for treating buccolingual wide proximal boxes. The 'Mucogingival repairs in periodontal surgery' document discusses various techniques for repairing mucogingival problems, including partial thickness apically repositioned flaps, laterally repositioned flaps, and free mucosal autografts. This document does not provide information on wedgeing methods for treating buccolingual wide proximal boxes. The 'Repair of gingival clefts' document presents two cases of extensive gingival clefts with surgical methods used for their correction. This document also does not provide information on wedgeing methods for treating buccolingual wide proximal boxes. Finally, we must look at the 'The papilla rotation flap' document which describes a new technique for correction of specific mucogingival defects. This document mentions nothing about wedgeing methods for treating buccolingual wide proximal boxes.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: None.\"\n}"]
