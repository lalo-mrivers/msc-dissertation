["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents suggest that Type I collagen is present in various tissues. We can look at the specific mention of each tissue to determine where it is NOT present. Bone is mentioned as a tissue where Type III collagen was found, but not Type I. Similarly, skin is mentioned as a normal tissue for Type I collagen synthesis. Cartilage is also mentioned as a tissue containing only one cell type, the chondrocyte, surrounded by an extensive extracellular matrix, which includes Type II collagen. Ligaments and aponeuroses are not explicitly mentioned in the documents, but it is common knowledge that they contain Type I collagen. Therefore, we can infer that Type I collagen is present in all EXCEPT cartilage.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
