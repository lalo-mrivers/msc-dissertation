["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant document that talks about normal WBC count is 'Diagnostic utility of white blood cell and differential cell counts.' It states that the normal range for white blood cell count is not provided, but it mentions that a patient with benign familial leucopenia had a mean white-cell count of 4,578 with a standard deviation of 940. This suggests that the normal range may be higher than expected. Another document 'Acute changes in haematological parameters on cessation of smoking' mentions that there was a rapid return towards normal in the elevated white cell count after cessation of cigarette smoking. The range provided is not specific, but it gives an idea that the normal range might be above 4,000. Lastly, the document 'Normal fluctuations of leucocyte counts and the response to infection in benign familial leucopenia' does not provide a specific range for normal WBC count.\", \"answer_choice\": A}"]
