["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the forces acting through a fixed partial denture on the abutment tooth. The relevant documents describe different types of loads and their effects on the periodontium. From these descriptions, it can be inferred that axial types of loads produce compressive stresses on the periodontium, whereas oblique or horizontal types of loads produce zones of compressive and tensile stresses. Therefore, forces acting through a fixed partial denture should ideally be directed parallel to the long axis of the teeth.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
