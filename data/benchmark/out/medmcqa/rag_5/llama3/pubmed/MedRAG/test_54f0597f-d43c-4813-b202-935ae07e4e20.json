["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the metabolism of ceramide in different cells and tissues. Ceramide is a fundamental structure and key intermediate of all sphingolipids, and its biosynthesis and catabolism are reviewed. In one study, exogenous glucosyl [3H]ceramide was found to be hydrolyzed in normal skin fibroblasts to [3H]ceramide and further to [3H]dihydrosphingosine and 3H-labeled fatty acids. These compounds are subsequently incorporated into cellular phospholipids. In contrast, glucosylceramidotic cells utilized labeled glucosylceramide far more for synthesis of lactosylceramide (lactocerebroside) and higher neutral glycosphingolipid homologues. Another study found that ceramide fatty acid ester was formed in rat brain after injection of double-labeled ceramides. Furthermore, studies have shown that ceramide can be a mediator of growth and differentiation.\",\n\"answer_choice\": A"]
