["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the documents provided, we can see that sodium bicarbonate is added to local anaesthetic solutions to alkalinize them. The papers 'Vasoactivity of local anaesthetic solutions', 'Comparison of plain and alkalinized local anaesthetic mixtures of lignocaine and bupivacaine for elective extradural caesarean section', and 'Onset of epidural blockade after plain or alkalinized 0.5% bupivacaine' all discuss the effect of adding sodium bicarbonate to local anaesthetics. We can see from these papers that alkalinization can increase the speed of onset of sensory and motor blockades, as seen in 'Comparison of plain and alkalinized local anaesthetic mixtures of lignocaine and bupivacaine for elective extradural caesarean section'. However, we also see that the addition of sodium bicarbonate to 0.5% bupivacaine does not improve the onset of epidural blockade in 'Onset of epidural blockade after plain or alkalinized 0.5% bupivacaine'. Based on this information, it seems that alkalinization can increase the speed and quality of anaesthesia.\",\n\"answer_choice\": A"]
