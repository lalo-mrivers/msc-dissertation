["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the role of a barrier membrane in GTR (Guided Tissue Regeneration). From the given documents, we can see that the principle of GTR involves preventing non-desirable types of tissue cells from migrating into a wound by means of a membrane barrier and giving preference to those particular cells that have the capacity to regenerate the desired type of tissue. This implies that the role of the barrier membrane is to prevent epithelial migration, which is option B.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
