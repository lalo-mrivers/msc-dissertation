["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the proportions of Ca, PO4, and K in early plaque of heavy calculus formers. From the given documents, we know that calcium phosphates are formed in saliva and dental plaque. In the document 'Formation of calcium phosphates in saliva and dental plaque', it is mentioned that one-week old plaque was studied from individuals who are heavy, moderate, and light calculus formers. This implies that the proportion of Ca, PO4, and K in early plaque of heavy calculus formers can be compared to those seen previously in dental plaque.\n\nFrom the document 'A case report of unusual dental calculus formation', we know that certain chemical salivary parameters are related to heavy calculus formers. However, this does not provide direct information on the proportions of Ca, PO4, and K.\n\nThe most relevant document is 'Scanning electron microscopy of dental calculus'. This study observed the morphologic structure of anorganic dental calculus, which is composed of two components with distinguishable patterns of calcification. One component is formed by the precipitation of minute calcific crystals on microorganisms and intermicrobial substances (plaque matrix). The other component exhibits a configuration of generally larger crystal growths of varying shapes and sizes.\n\nGiven that calcium phosphates are formed in saliva and dental plaque, it can be inferred that Ca and PO4 would be present in early plaque. However, there is no direct information on the proportion of K to Ca and PO4.\n\nBased on this analysis, we can infer that Ca > PO4 > K (Option A) as calcium phosphates are formed in saliva and dental plaque, but the proportion of K is not explicitly mentioned.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
