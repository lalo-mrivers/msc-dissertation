["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the CRISPR-Cas 9 system, which is a tool for genome editing. The relevant documents are about molecular genetics, DNA repair, and recombination mechanisms. From the information provided, we can infer that homologous recombination is involved in the process of genome editing. This is supported by the study on exploring the pathways of homologous recombination, which mentions double-strand breaks occurring by two different mechanisms.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
