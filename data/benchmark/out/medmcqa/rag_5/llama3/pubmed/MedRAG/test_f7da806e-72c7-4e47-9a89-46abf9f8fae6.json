["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks for a laboratory test most useful for patients under dicumarol therapy. From the provided documents, we know that acenocoumarol is another name for dicumarol. We also know from the first document that the prothrombin level appears to be independent of the plasma concentration of acenocoumarol, which is higher in old patients than in younger patients. This suggests that a test measuring prothrombin levels would be useful for monitoring patients under dicumarol therapy. The 'Thrombotest' response mentioned in the third document also measures prothrombin levels and is used to predict warfarin requirements.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
