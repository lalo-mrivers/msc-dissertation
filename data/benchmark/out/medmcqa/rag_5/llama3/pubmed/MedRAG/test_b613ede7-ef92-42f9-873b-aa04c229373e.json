["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the formation of dental plaque. We can see from the documents that soluble enzymes in human dental plaque material synthetise a polysaccharide material when incubated with sucrose. Additionally, invertase activity was found to dominate sucrolysis within plaque with 99.67% of the total activity. This suggests that enzymes are reacting with sucrose to form dental plaque.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
