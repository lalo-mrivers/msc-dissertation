["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents discuss the vertical proportions of the face, particularly the ratios between different facial heights. In 'Vertical proportions of face: a cephalometric study', it is stated that the ratio of Upper Anterior Facial Height to Total Anterior Facial Height remained constant, as well as the ratio of Lower Posterior Facial Height to Total Posterior Facial Height. This suggests that there are specific proportions that contribute to facial harmony. Additionally, in 'Vertical proportions: a guide for prognosis and treatment in anterior open-bite', it is mentioned that the ratio of upper anterior face height to lower anterior face height (UAFH/LAFH) is an aid in determining the prognosis for orthodontic correction of anterior open-bite. This suggests that facial proportions are important in understanding facial harmony and can be used as a guide for treatment. Therefore, it can be concluded that the facial proportions between upper, middle, and lower thirds of fare are not equally distributed.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
