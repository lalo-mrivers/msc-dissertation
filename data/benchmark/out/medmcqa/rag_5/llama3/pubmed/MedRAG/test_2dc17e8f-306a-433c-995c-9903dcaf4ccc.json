["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the part of the mandible that ossifies in cartilage. From the provided documents, we can see that Meckel's cartilage (Secondary cartilages) fuse with two secondary cartilages to form a large fibrocartilage within the symphyseal joint and in adults contains a large fibrocartilage which mediates mandibular movements. Also, the study on thanatophoric dysplasia shows that condylar cartilages are involved in mandibular growth and undergo membranous ossification. Therefore, it is likely that cartilage ossifies in the condylar process.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
