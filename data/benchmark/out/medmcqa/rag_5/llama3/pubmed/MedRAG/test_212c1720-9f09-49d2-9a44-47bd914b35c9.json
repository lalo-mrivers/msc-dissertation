["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents discuss anatomical dead space, which is mentioned as a component of the total dead space volume measured by VD(F) or VD(O). The measurement method is described in detail, and it seems that the main concern is the difference between VD(O) and VD(F), with both increasing with lung volume but VD(p) remaining constant. This suggests that anatomical dead space is a component of total dead space that can be measured using these techniques.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
