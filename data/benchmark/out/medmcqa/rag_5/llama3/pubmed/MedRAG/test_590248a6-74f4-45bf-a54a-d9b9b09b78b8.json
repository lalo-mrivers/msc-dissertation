["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The foramen magnum is a opening at the base of the skull that transmits several important structures. It is located just above the spinal cord. The vertebral arteries pass through this opening and then enter the spine, providing blood supply to the spinal cord. The spinal branch of the 10th cranial nerve (vagus nerve) also passes through the foramen magnum. Finally, the spinal cord itself exits the skull through the foramen magnum. Based on this anatomy, it is clear that all except one option transmits structures through the foramen magnum. That one exception is option B: Spinal branch of 10th nerve.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
