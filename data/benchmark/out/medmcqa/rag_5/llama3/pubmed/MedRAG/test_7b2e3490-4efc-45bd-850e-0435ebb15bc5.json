["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has cardiorespiratory arrest in a hospital ward. The relevant document is 'Survival after cardiac arrest in hospital.' According to this document, the probability of successful resuscitation is greater in patients with primary cardiac disease. However, it does not provide specific guidance on oxygenation. Another relevant document is 'Defining indications for artificial organ support in respiratory failure.' This document suggests that temporary support with ECMO (extracorporeal membrane oxygenation) is indicated in patients with high mortality risk and no signs of irreversible damage. Based on this information, the focus should be on providing support to maintain life until further treatment can be provided. Therefore, ECMO or another form of artificial organ support might be considered.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
