["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The given documents discuss lateral asymmetry in movement, hemispheric priming, conjugate lateral eye movements, and lateral facilitation of Hoffmann-reflexes. The term 'lateral shift' or 'Bennett's movement' is not directly mentioned in the provided texts. However, Bennett's movement refers to a phenomenon where people tend to shift their jaw laterally during speech.

Therefore, I will consider the options related to tooth positioning.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C: Both of the above\"\n}"]
