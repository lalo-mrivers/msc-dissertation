["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about periodontal surgery necessary for horizontal bone loss in the upper anterior region. After reviewing the provided documents, I found that 'Periodontal surgery for the maxillary anterior area' discusses a modified surgical technique for treating maxillary anterior periodontal pathoses. This technique gives selective access to the periodontally diseased root surfaces while allowing the periodontist to avoid facial areas with shallow pockets.
