["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the given documents, it can be inferred that osteoclasts are involved in bone resorption. According to 'Mechanism of osteoclastic bone resorption: a new hypothesis', osteoclasts demineralize areas of bone and degrade noncollagen bone matrix. This process is followed by phagocytosis of exposed collagen fibrils by mononuclear, fibroblast-like or monocyte-derived cells. Furthermore, 'Osteoclast is derived from mononuclear hematopoietic stem cells, most likely within the granulocyte-macrophage lineage' suggests that osteoclasts are derived from mononuclear precursor cells. Therefore, considering the presence of macrophages and osteoclasts in this context, the correct answer is A: Zone of infection.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
