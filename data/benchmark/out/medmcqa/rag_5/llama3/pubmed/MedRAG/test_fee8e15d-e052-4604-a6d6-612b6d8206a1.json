["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the given documents, we know that anaemia is a common clinical problem in infancy. We also know about extrinsic duodenal obstruction in infants and children. The Guthrie test is positive, which suggests the presence of phenylketonuria (PKU). This condition is caused by a deficiency of the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase. It is characterized by high levels of phenylalanine in the blood and urine.\n\nFrom the document 'Anaemia in infancy', we can infer that PKU is a genetically determined abnormality of haemoglobin synthesis, which is common in the tropics. This condition can be suspected clinically and often managed without laboratory facilities.\n\nThe document 'Gastroenteritis: a continuing problem of child health in Britain' does not provide any information relevant to this question.\n\nFrom the document 'Extrinsic duodenal obstruction in infants and children', we do not find any connection between PKU and extrinsic duodenal obstruction.\n\nFrom the document 'Screening in child care', we can infer that screening tests should have a substantial period between first possible detection and optimal time for treatment. The Guthrie test is used to screen for PKU, which fits this criteria.\n\nTherefore, considering all these factors, I deduce that the correct answer is B: White patch of hair due to tryptophan deficiency because it is not related to PKU.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
