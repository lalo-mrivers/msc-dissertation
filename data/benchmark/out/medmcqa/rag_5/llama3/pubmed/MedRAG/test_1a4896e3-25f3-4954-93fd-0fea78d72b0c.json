["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about a condition that is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait. We can start by reviewing the provided documents. The first document describes hereditary brachydactyly with nail dysplasia, which has been transmitted through 6 generations affecting males and females. This suggests an autosomal disorder with full penetrance and variable expressivity. The second document discusses pedigree patterns of autosomal dominant inheritance, which matches what we see in the family history. The third document reports on tetramelic monodactyly with autosomal dominant inheritance, further supporting this possibility. Finally, the fourth document mentions a familial transmission of Brown syndrome that could be an autosomal dominant disorder with decreased penetrance.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, it appears that hereditary brachydactyly with nail dysplasia is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
