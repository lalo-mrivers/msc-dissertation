["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about a patient with history of frequent abortions and pain in calf muscles. The relevant documents are about spontaneous abortion, previous reproductive history, leg pain, accessory soleus, and myotonic dystrophy. None of these topics seem directly related to the patient's symptoms. However, the document on previous reproductive history mentions that mothers who had delivered a chromosomally normal abortion more often had a history of previous repeated abortions. This makes me think of the possibility of myotonic dystrophy, which is associated with frequent spontaneous abortions and muscular weakness/pain. The document also mentions the importance of careful clinical examination in diagnosis, which is consistent with the patient's symptoms.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
