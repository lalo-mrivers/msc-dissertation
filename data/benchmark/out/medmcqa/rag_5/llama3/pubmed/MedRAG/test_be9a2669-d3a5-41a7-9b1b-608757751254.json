["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents indicate that red blood cells (RBCs) are suitable for frozen storage. In 'Erythrocyte metabolism', it is mentioned that traditional liquid storage compromises RBC functions, but frozen storage maintains these functions indefinitely. Additionally, in 'Suitable survival and half-life of red cells after frozen storage in excess of 10 years', the document states that previously frozen RBCs had normal 24-hour posttransfusion survival and half-life when stored for over 10 years. This suggests that RBCs can be stored at very low temperatures (frozen) without compromising their function. Therefore, the answer is not among the options that suggest storing RBCs at room temperature or body temperature.\",\n\"answer_choice\": A\n}"]
