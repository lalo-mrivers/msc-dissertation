["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the given documents, we know that during pregnancy, insulin requirement increases (from Metabolic changes in pregnancy relevant to diabetes mellitus). This is a normal metabolic change during pregnancy. Therefore, option B is true.\n\nWe also know from Diabetes and pregnancy that care programs emphasizing normalization of maternal glucose levels have resulted in perinatal outcome that is nearly equivalent to that observed in normal pregnancies. This implies that controlling blood sugar levels is important for a healthy pregnancy.\n\nInsulin does not cross the placenta (according to Diabetic pregnancy: management of diabetes on the day of delivery). Therefore, option A is true.\n\nTolbutamide crosses the placenta and can cause pulmonary edema and increased blood pressure in the mother (from Diabetes and pregnancy). Therefore, option C is false. Additionally, Tolbutamide causes preeclampsia (PIH) (also from Diabetes and pregnancy). Therefore, option D is true.\n\nThe only option left is B: During pregnancy insulin requirement increases and cannot be provided with sulphonylureas. This is supported by the evidence from Metabolic changes in pregnancy relevant to diabetes mellitus and Diabetes and pregnancy. Hence, this is the correct answer.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
