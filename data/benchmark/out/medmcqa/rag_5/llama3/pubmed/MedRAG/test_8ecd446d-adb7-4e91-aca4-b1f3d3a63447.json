["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the typical shape of an access cavity for a mandibular first molar. None of the provided documents explicitly state the shape of the access cavity for this tooth. However, we can consider the anatomy of the pulp floor and canal orifices mentioned in the first document. The C-shaped canal configurations described do not provide direct information about the shape of an access cavity. Therefore, we need to rely on general knowledge and principles of oral surgery.

The removal of malpositioned premolars and canines.', the typical shape of an access cavity for mandibular first molar is trapezoid.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
