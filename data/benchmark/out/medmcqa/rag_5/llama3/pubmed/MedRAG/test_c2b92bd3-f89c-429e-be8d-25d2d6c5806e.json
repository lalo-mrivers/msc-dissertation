["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the documents provided, it can be seen that flow cytometry is a technique used to analyze cells based on their physical and chemical characteristics. Forward scatter refers to the light scattered by the cells as they pass through the laser beam in the flow cytometer. This is mentioned in the document 'Establishing optimal lymphocyte gates for immunophenotyping by flow cytometry'. The document states that forward and orthogonal light scatter are used to accurately distinguish lymphocytes from other leukocyte populations. Therefore, it can be inferred that forward scatter in flow cytometry is used to assess cell size.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
