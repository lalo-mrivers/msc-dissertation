["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents provided are related to dental caries diagnosis methods. The question is about Diagnodent's use for detecting caries. Since none of the provided documents explicitly mention Diagnodent, we need to search for information on this topic elsewhere. Unfortunately, there is no information available in the provided documents about Diagnodent's method. We can only rely on our general knowledge that Diagnodent uses a laser-induced fluorescence technology (LIT) to detect dental caries. This method emits low-level laser light through a probe and measures the fluorescence emitted by the tooth structure.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
