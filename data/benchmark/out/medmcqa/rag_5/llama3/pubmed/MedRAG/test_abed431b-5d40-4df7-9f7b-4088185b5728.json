["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the percentage of lost radio-resistant cells in retina. The relevant documents mention retinal photoreceptors, rods and cones, and ganglion cells. Considering the information provided, it seems that the lost cells refer to the photoreceptors or their remnants. The study on cone inputs to ganglion cells mentions that the photoreceptor layer degenerated, but cone nuclei apparently devoid of outer segments were retained in retinas of aged rats. This suggests that some photoreceptors may remain even after degeneration.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
