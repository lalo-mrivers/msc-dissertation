["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the cells that are decreased in chronic periodontitis. We need to find relevant information from the provided documents that compares the cell count in healthy and diseased tissues. Upon reviewing the documents, we find a study that counted mast cells in gingival tissues of healthy volunteers and patients with chronic periodontal disease.
