["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about intracellular iron homeostasis in iron deficiency anemia. We need to analyze the given documents. From 'Normal serum iron and elevated total iron-binding capacity in iron-deficiency states', we know that during iron deficiency, an elevation of total iron-binding capacity occurs before the decrease of the serum iron. This may represent a compensatory mechanism to mobilize all traces of tissue iron to maintain normal erythropoiesis. This suggests that when there is a demand for more iron due to iron deficiency, the body tries to release more iron from storage sites like ferritin. Therefore, apoferritin mRNA would increase, leading to increased ferritin synthesis.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
