["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the given documents, we know that the presence of HBsAg in a mother during pregnancy can lead to transplacental infection of the child with HBsAg. This is evident from the fact that some children born to HBsAg-positive mothers have been found to be HBsAg positive themselves at birth or soon after. Prevention of chronic HBsAg carrier state in infants of HBsAg-positive mothers by hepatitis B immunoglobulin is a suggested method. The document 'Prevention of chronic HBsAg carrier state in infants of HBsAg-positive mothers by hepatitis B immunoglobulin' specifically states that giving 0.5 ml/kg hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIg) within 48 h after birth and subsequently 0.16 ml/kg every month for 6 months can prevent infection to the child.
