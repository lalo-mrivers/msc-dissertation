["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents provided are studies on the performance of dental air turbine handpieces, characterization of wear of tungsten carbide burs, use of a potential of mean force to analyze free energy contributions in protein folding, and variation in output factor caused by secondary blocking for 7-16 MeV electron beams. Among these documents, only one is related to bur efficiency which is the first document 'Studies on the performance of dental air turbine handpieces.' This study shows that the rotational performance of air turbine handpieces are influenced over the supplying air pressure and cutting bur length. It does not mention spiral angle, head length and diameter, neck diameter, or crosscut as factors affecting bur efficiency.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
