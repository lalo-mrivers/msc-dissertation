["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks what is false about rapid sequence induction in a cardiac patient in emergency. The options provided are all related to the procedure of rapid sequence induction, so let's analyze each option critically.\\n\\nOption A: 'Inducing agent and neuromuscular relaxant are administered together' is correct as it is the standard practice during rapid sequence induction.\\n\\nOption B: 'The patient is pre-oxygenated for 3 minutes before the procedure' might be ideal but not essential, as cardiac patients in emergency may not have that luxury. So, this option could be true or false depending on the scenario. But since we are looking for what is wrong about rapid sequence induction, let's assume it's true.\\n\\nOption C: 'Cricoid pressure has to be applied till the endotracheal tube has been secured with a cuff' is not correct as the American Society of Anesthesiologists recommends releasing cricoid pressure once the tube is in place but before securing it with a cuff. So, this option is false.\\n\\nOption D: 'Induction should be done with thiopentone sodium and succinylcholine for muscle relaxation' seems to be true as these are common agents used during rapid sequence induction.\\n\\nAfter analyzing each option, we can conclude that the only incorrect statement is Option C.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
