["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 76-year-old female presenting with a non-healing ulcer on the labia majora for 6 months. The biopsy shows squamous cell carcinoma. Given this information, we can consider the provided treatment options.\n\nFirstly, the presence of lymphadenopathy is not mentioned in the case description, which suggests that the patient does not have palpable lymph nodes. This would suggest against radical vulvectomy with sentinel LN biopsy (Option A) as it is typically used to identify occult lymph node metastases.\n\nSecondly, the size of the tumor (2 x 3 cm) and its location on the labia majora suggests that a more conservative approach may be suitable. Wide excision (Option B) or simple vulvectomy (Option C) could be considered as they allow for removal of the tumor while preserving surrounding tissue.\n\nLastly, chemoradiation with resection (Option D) is not specifically mentioned in the relevant documents but it's a common treatment option for squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix and other locations. However, given that this is a vulval lesion, the effectiveness of chemoradiation with resection in this location is unclear.\n\nBased on these considerations, we can infer that the most suitable options would be Wide excision (Option B) or simple vulvectomy (Option C).\",\n\n\"answer_choice\": \"B/C\"\n}"]
