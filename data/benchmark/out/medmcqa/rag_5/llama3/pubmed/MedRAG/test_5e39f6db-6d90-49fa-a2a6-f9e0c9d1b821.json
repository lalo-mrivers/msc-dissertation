["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the injuries caused by a bomb blast that took place in Delhi following which 2 persons died. From the given documents, we can infer that the blast injuries to the lungs are rare and invariably fatal due to direct compression. This information is not relevant to this question as it is not related to deaths caused by a bomb blast. The Clinical aspects of ball-bearing bomb injuries document provides information about the mechanism of the weapon and the nature of the injuries, which suggests that the injuries were caused by ball-bearings rather than burns or air blast. Therefore, options A and B can be eliminated as they are not related to the given scenario. Option C is also incorrect because the force of explosion in a bomb blast is not directional. The triad of main explosive injuries seen includes bruise, laceration, and fractures which suggests that option D is the correct answer.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
