["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks for the cut-off values in a 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test. The relevant documents describe different studies with various glucose loads and time intervals. After reviewing the texts, I found that the fasting glucose determination is more reproducible and stable, indicating it's better for diagnostic purposes. The optimal level for diagnosis of diabetes was mentioned as 7.5 mmol/l (136 mg/dl) for the fasting glucose and equivalent two-hour value of 14 mmol/l (250 mg/dl). However, this information only provides a general guideline, not specific cut-off values for 1 hour and 2 hours after meals.\", \"answer_choice\": B}"]
