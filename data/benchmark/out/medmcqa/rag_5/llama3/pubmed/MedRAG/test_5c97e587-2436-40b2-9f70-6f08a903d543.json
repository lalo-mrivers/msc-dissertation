["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents discuss intraoral dental xeroradiography, which has been shown to require less radiation compared to conventional intraoral film radiographs. Specifically, the document 'Imaging properties of intraoral dental xeroradiography' states that intraoral xeroradiography requires only a third of the radiation dose of corresponding intraoral film techniques. Additionally, the document 'Xeroradiography of dental structures. I. Preliminary investigations.' also mentions that high-quality images were produced at radiation exposures up to seven times less than for conventional intraoral film radiography. Based on this information, we can conclude that patient radiation is decreased in intraoral radiographs.\", \"answer_choice\": C}"]
