["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The given documents provide information about dopamine receptor interactions, phasic versus tonic dopamine release, and molecular biology of the dopamine receptors. There is no direct information provided about the properties of dopamine that are helpful or unhelpful in acute shock. However, we can infer from our understanding of dopamine's effects on the cardiovascular system that alpha-1 agonist action leading to peripheral vasoconstriction (A) would be detrimental in acute shock as it could worsen hypotension. The other options appear to have beneficial effects.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
