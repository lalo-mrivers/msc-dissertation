["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"After reviewing the provided documents, I did not find any information that directly mentions the melting zone used for alloy during casting. However, I can infer that the documents describe various techniques and methods related to metal fusion, investment materials, and casting procedures. Since none of the documents provide specific information on the melting zone, I will rely on my general knowledge to answer the question. Metal fusion is typically achieved through high-temperature processes such as melting or flame-based methods.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
