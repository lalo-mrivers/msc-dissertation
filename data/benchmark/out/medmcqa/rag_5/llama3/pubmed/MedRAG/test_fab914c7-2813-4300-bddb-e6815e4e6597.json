["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks for a highly vascular tumor of brain and spinal cord in adults. The relevant documents describe various types of tumors, including hemangiomas, hemangioblastoma, cavernous malformation, glioblastoma multiforme, meningiomas, neurofibromas, ependymomas, low-grade astrocytomas, and metastasis. Upon reviewing the documents, it is clear that glioblastoma multiforme can be highly vascular as described in 'Distant angiogenesis in a patient with glioblastoma multiforme'. Additionally, hemangioblastoma is also mentioned as being highly vascular and associated with von Hippel-Lindau disease. Both of these options are relevant to the brain and spinal cord. Spinal neoplasms may be primary or metastatic, benign or malignant, and the most common spinal neoplasms are meningiomas and neurofibromas. However, this does not necessarily mean that they would be highly vascular. Therefore, the step-by-step thinking process suggests that glioblastoma multiforme and hemangioblastoma could be the relevant options.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
