["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the administration of betamethasone to a mother with premature delivery. The relevant documents describe the use of betamethasone for prenatal exposure and its effects on reducing respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) and mortality in premature infants. According to the first document, 'Prenatal administration of betamethasone for prevention of respiratory distress syndrome', the incidence of RDS was 37.7% in treated infants compared to 50.7% in untreated infants. The second document, 'The use of betamethasone and timed delivery in management of premature rupture of the membranes in the preterm pregnancy', shows that neonatal mortality was significantly less in the steroid group (15% vs. 50%, p less than .01). There is no mention of hyperbilirubinemia or intraventricular hemorrhage in the provided documents.\", \n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
