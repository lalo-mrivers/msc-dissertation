["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"I reviewed the provided documents and did not find a description of a radio-opaque area found at the root apex of young permanent teeth involved with chronic pulpitis. The closest document that comes close to describing periapical pathology is the one titled 'Pulpectomy procedure for deciduous teeth with severe pulpal necrosis.'
