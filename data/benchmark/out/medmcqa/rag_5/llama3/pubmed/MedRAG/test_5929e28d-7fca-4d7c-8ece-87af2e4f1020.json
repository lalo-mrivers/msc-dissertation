["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about tooth structure cutting being preceded by crack propagation due to tensile forces. The relevant document for this is 'Thermal stress in teeth'. This study combines observations from in vivo and in vitro studies with numerical analysis techniques to identify the influence of thermal stresses on crack creation and propagation in teeth. It considers factors such as tooth type, age, material properties, temperature change, and thermal resistance. Based on this information, it can be inferred that tensile forces are related to crack propogation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
