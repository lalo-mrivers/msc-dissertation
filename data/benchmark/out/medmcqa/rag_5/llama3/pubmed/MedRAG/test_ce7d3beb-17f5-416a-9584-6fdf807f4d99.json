["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 24-year-old female with patchy non-scarring alopecia in the right temporal and occipital region. The examination reveals multiple small broken hairs. Scrapings from the scalp show mild inflammation, peri-follicular hemorrhage, and surrounding mild lymphocytic infiltration. Given these findings, we can eliminate scarring alopecia, as it is not mentioned. We also know that the patient does not have a concomitant cellular infiltrate, which rules out male pattern alopecia. Additionally, there is no mention of androgens or hormones, so androgenic alopecia seems unlikely. The presence of broken hairs suggests that the patient may be experiencing excessive shedding, but without further information, we cannot confirm this. Finally, the patient's age and the presentation of patchy hair loss make alopecia areata a strong possibility.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
