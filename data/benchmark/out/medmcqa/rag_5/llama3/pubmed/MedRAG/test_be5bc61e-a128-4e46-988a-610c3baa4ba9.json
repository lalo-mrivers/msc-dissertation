["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, it can be inferred that dentinal tubule penetration is influenced by the presence or absence of surface debris. In 'The morphologic relationship between dental resins and etched dentin', it is mentioned that pretreatment with othophosphoric acid enlarged the dentinal tubules facilitating penetration of the resin. Similarly, in 'Dentin permeation: comparison of diffusion with filtration', it is stated that acid etching removes occluding debris, which facilitates filtration more than diffusion. This suggests that the presence or absence of surface debris plays a crucial role in sealer penetration into dentinal tubules.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
