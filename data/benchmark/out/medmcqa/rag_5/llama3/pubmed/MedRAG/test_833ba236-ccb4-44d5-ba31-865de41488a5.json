["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about hormones given after resection of the posterior pituitary. The relevant documents mention anterior pituitary function before and after trans-sphenoidal microsurgical resection of pituitary tumors, but do not specifically address resection of the posterior pituitary. However, we can infer that the question is likely referring to hormones produced by the anterior pituitary, as the posterior pituitary primarily regulates antidiuretic hormone (ADH). Based on this assumption, let's evaluate each option: Glucagon is produced by the pancreas, not the pituitary gland. Thyroxine and Estradiol are both thyroid hormones, but they are not typically produced by the anterior pituitary. Mineralocoicoid refers to aldosterone, which is a hormone produced by the adrenal cortex, not the pituitary gland. Therefore, the answer must be one of these options.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
