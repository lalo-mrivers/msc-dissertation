["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the provided documents, we can see that benzodiazepines bind to benzodiazepine receptors. In 'Influence of GABA receptor agonists and antagonists on the binding of 3H-diazepam to the benzodiazepine receptor', it is mentioned that GABA receptor antagonists decrease the affinity of the benzodiazepine receptor for 3H-diazepam. Flumazenil is a well-known benzodiazepine antagonist, which binds to benzodiazepine receptors and reverses their effects. Therefore, we can conclude that the correct answer is A: Flumazenil.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
