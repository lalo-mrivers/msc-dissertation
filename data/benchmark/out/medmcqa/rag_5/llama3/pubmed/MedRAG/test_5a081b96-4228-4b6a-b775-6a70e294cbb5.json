["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the provided documents, we are looking for information about faciolingual dimensions. The 'Dental morphology of 45,XO human females' study states that in normal females and males, mesiodistal and faciolingual dimensions were reduced in 45,XO females. This suggests that the faciolingual dimension is smaller in 45,XO females compared to normal females and males. The same document also mentions that the 'steepest cusps' were found in 45,XO females, which implies that the shape of the cusp may be affected by the sex chromosomes. However, we are looking for information about the largest faciolingual dimension, not the shape of the cusp.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
