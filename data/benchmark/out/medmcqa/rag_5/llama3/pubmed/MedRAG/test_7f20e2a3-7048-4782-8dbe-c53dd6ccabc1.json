["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about reducing patient somatic exposure when taking radiographs. The relevant documents mention methods to minimize radiation dosage to the patient. One method mentioned is radiographic duplication, which is 33 1/3 per cent faster with intensified light. Another method is to salvage every overexposed film rather than re-examining the patient. However, these methods are not directly related to reducing somatic exposure. The document 'Protection and safety in the X-ray department' emphasizes the importance of constant awareness of potential hazards from ionizing radiation and regular checks on procedures and equipment. This implies that proper radiographic technique and quality control are essential in minimizing patient exposure. Therefore, the most effective method of reducing patient somatic exposure would be to use a method that ensures optimal radiographic image quality while minimizing radiation exposure.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
