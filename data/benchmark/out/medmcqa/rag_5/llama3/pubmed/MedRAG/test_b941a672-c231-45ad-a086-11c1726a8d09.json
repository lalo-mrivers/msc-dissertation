["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The study of blood pyruvic acid levels in pellagrins shows that there is impairment of pyruvic acid metabolism in cases of pellagra. The study also shows that after administration of nicotinic acid alone for 15 days, the pyruvic acid levels returned to normal. This indicates that nicotinic acid deficiency is the cause of deranged pyruvate metabolism. Additionally, the effect of excess intake of leucine and valine deficiency on tryptophan and niacin metabolites in humans shows a marked decrease in plasma (or serum) valine level when a valine-deficient diet was fed. This suggests that nicotinic acid plays a role in maintaining normal levels of valine, which is an amino acid. Therefore, it can be concluded that deficiency of nicotinic acid results in pellagra.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
