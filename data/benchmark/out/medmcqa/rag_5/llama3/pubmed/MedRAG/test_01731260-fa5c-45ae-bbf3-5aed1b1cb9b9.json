["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the role of fibroblasts in the remodeling of periodontal ligament during physiologic tooth movement. It is mentioned that fibroblasts are capable of synthesizing and degrading collagen simultaneously, which allows for the orderly control of collagen remodeling within the periodontal ligament. Additionally, it is suggested that coordinated action of fibroblasts and osteoclasts near the alveolar bone surface may represent part of a local mechanism through which rapid remodelling of certain areas in the periodontal ligament may be accomplished.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
