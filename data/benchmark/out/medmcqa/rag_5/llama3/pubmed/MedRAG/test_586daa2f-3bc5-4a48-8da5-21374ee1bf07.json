["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The order of caries susceptibility of primary teeth is not directly mentioned in the provided documents. However, we can analyze the data sets presented in 'Caries prediction on the basis of past caries including precavity lesions'. The data sets involve children aged 7-10 years, and the results show that the proportion of children with 'high caries increment' was 25.0% for one group and 16.6% for another group. Although the exact order is not specified, we can infer that the first molars may have a higher caries susceptibility than the second molars based on the data.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
