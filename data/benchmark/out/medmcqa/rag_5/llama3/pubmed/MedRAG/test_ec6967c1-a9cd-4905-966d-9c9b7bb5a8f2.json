["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant document that discusses mandibular fractures is 'Atrophy of the mandible: reconstruction following fracture.' The case report describes a rational approach to managing spontaneous fractures of the severely atrophied mandible. However, it does not specifically discuss parasymphysial fractures. The other documents, such as 'Complicated mandibular fractures' and 'Fractures of the radial head in the geriatric patient: case report,' provide general information about mandibular fractures but do not offer specific guidance for parasymphysial fractures. Therefore, we must rely on our understanding of general principles for managing mandibular fractures to inform our treatment plan.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
