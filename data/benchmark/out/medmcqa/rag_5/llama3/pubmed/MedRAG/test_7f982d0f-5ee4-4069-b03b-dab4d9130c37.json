["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents provided discuss various forms of aneuploidy, including Down's syndrome, Turner-Down syndrome, and partial trisomy 1q. The key to answering this question is to identify the types of genetic aberrations that cause Down's syndrome. According to the literature, Down's syndrome is caused by trisomy of the 21st chromosome (reported in multiple documents). Mosaicism of the 21st chromosome is also discussed as a possible combination with Turner-Down syndrome, but it is not the primary cause of Down's syndrome. Robertsonian translocation of 21.21 or 21.18 is also mentioned as a rare occurrence, and deletion of 21 is not discussed in these documents. Therefore, based on the provided information, we can conclude that Down's syndrome is caused by trisomy of the 21st chromosome.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
