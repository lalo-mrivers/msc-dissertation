["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The provided documents discuss the growth of calcium phosphates on natural enamel. The growth kinetics are studied at 25 degrees C and pH 7.40 in stable supersaturated solutions of calcium phosphate. This suggests that the starting point for calcification is the natural enamel, which is supported by 'The growth of calcium phosphates on natural enamel'. There is no mention of root, CEJ, or DEJ as starting points for calcification.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
