["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the most consistent feature of rapidly progressing glomerulonephritis (RPGN). The relevant documents describe different forms of RPGN. In one document, it is mentioned that four out of ten patients with idiopathic RPGN responded to high-dose corticosteroids and had minimal glomerular and crescentic sclerosis. This suggests that crescent formation may be a feature of some cases of RPGN. Another document mentions that pulse steroids and monthly intravenous cyclophosphamide were used to treat seven patients with crescentic glomerulonephritis, indicating the presence of crescents in these patients. In another document, it is mentioned that 25 patients with RPGN were treated with methylprednisolone (MP) pulse therapy; however, this document does not specifically mention crescent formation as a feature of RPGN. Finally, one document describes the morphological and clinical course of different forms of glomerulonephritis and concludes that every form has its individual course and prognosis. Therefore, based on the information provided, the most consistent feature of rapidly progressing glomerulonephritis (RPGN) appears to be crescent formation.\",\n\"answer_choice\": A"]
