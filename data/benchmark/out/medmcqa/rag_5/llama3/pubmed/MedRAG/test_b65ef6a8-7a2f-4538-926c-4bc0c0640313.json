["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about evaluating post-operative vision effects after cataract extraction surgery under Predictive Biomarkers for Cataract (PCB). The relevant documents discuss various surgical techniques and their outcomes. None of the documents explicitly mention PCB or its use in monitoring post-operative vision effects. However, one document discusses visual results and complications of 500 intraocular lens implantations. This suggests that visual assessments are an important aspect of cataract extraction surgery. Considering the options, active surveillance seems a more plausible approach for evaluating post-operative vision effects.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
