["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about white radiating lines that can be observed in case of lesions. Let's look at the provided documents for relevant information. The first document describes a sun figure which is an illusory diffuse contour resulting from an arrangement of dots, but it does not mention any lesions or oral conditions. The second document discusses creating the appearance of white enamel dysmineralization with bonded resins and does not relate to lesions either. The third document is about excisions in the area of the chin and does not provide information about radiating lines. The fourth document presents a case report on migratory stomatitis, which describes circumscribed, flat, smooth, and red lesions with slightly raised white borders. These radiating lines match the description in the question. Therefore, it is likely that white radiating Lines can be observed in case of Lesions of migratory stomatitis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
