["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the given documents, we can see that zinc phosphate cement, reinforced zinc oxide-eugenol cement, and polycarboxylate cements are favored for permanent luting of cast restorations. The properties of four dental cements show no significant difference in the retentive property of zinc phosphate and polycarboxylate cements. This suggests that both zinc eugenol cement and polycarboxylate cement have similar properties that make them suitable for permanent luting. The recall evaluation study also shows no significant differences between restoration luted with the two cements. Therefore, it can be concluded that a common property of both zinc eugenol cement and polycarboxylate cement is their suitability for permanent luting.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
