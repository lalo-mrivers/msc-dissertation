["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the documents provided, particularly 'Interactions of ordered water and cations in the gel-forming polysaccharide gellan gum', it is clear that potassium ions are involved in the structural role of water molecules and cations in the gel-forming properties of gellan gum. This indicates a functional similarity between potassium sulphate and potassium ions. In a gypsum product, the primary function of potassium sulphate would be to regulate setting time.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
