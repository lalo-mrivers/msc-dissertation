["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, it's clear that the primary focus is on the development of dental occlusion. In the context of anterior guidance, we see that the key to successful occlusal treatment lies in the position and movement of both the anterior teeth and condylar borders. This suggests a more nuanced understanding of tooth interaction, which cannot be reduced to simple surface-level contact between teeth. Instead, we're looking at the complex interplay between anterior tooth position and condylar border movements. Given this information, it's likely that the correct answer is not one of the options provided.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"None of the above\"\n}"]
