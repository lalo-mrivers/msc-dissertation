["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about a material used in its pure form in dentistry. We need to look for documents that mention the use of materials in their pure form. In the first document, it talks about a new type of hydraulic dental cement, but there's no mention of using any material in its pure form. The second and third documents also don't contain any information relevant to this question.
