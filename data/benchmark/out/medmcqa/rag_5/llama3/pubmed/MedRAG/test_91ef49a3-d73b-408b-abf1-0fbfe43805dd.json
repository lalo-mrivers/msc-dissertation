["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question describes a lesion on the cheek with raised, pearly borders and telangiectasias on its surface. This description is similar to that of white sponge nevus of the tongue, which is described in the first document as having 'white or grayish-white lesions with raised borders'. However, this condition typically affects the oral mucous membranes, not the cheek. The document does not describe any similar lesions on the face or scalp, but it does mention that the recognition of white sponge nevus is important for differentiating it from other congenital or familial disorders of more widespread clinical significance. Therefore, it is unlikely that this is the correct diagnosis. The other options are also less likely as they typically present differently.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
