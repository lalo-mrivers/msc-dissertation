["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the identification of olfactory-specific proteins that represent each component in a second messenger cascade. The application of molecular genetic techniques has led to the cloning of 18 different members of an extremely large multigene family that encodes seven transmembrane domain proteins whose expression is restricted to the olfactory epithelium. This suggests that receptors for olfactory sensation are present in the olfactory epithelium.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
