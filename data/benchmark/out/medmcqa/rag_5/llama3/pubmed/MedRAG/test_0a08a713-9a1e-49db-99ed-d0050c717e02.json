["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents mention different aspects of dental anatomy and restorations. The key to this question is finding a tooth where crown bulk distal to the faciolingual dissecting plane is typical. Upon reviewing the documents, we can see that the document about surgical considerations for prosthodontic patients mentions procedures like aesthetic root coverage and ridge augmentation. These procedures are more relevant to posterior teeth than anterior teeth. The anatomy of maxillary molar furcal plane crown preparation also discusses posterior teeth. This leads us to focus on posterior teeth, specifically mandibular teeth. Among the choices, second premolar is a typical posterior tooth where crown bulk distal to the faciolingual dissecting plane would be expected.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
