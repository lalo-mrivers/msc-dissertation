["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks for an exception to unconjugated bilirubin being increased. From the given documents, we can see that hyperbilirubinemia is classified as conjugated or unconjugated based on liver function tests. Conjugated hyperbilirubinemia involves elevations in various liver function measurements, particularly alkaline phosphatase, bile acid, gamma-glutamyl transferase, and 5'-nucleotidase. Unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia is only classified if results of all other liver function tests are normal.\n\nBased on this information, we can deduce that the exceptions to unconjugated bilirubin being increased would be those conditions where there is elevation in one or more of these liver function measurements. Criggler Najjar syndrome and Dubin Johnson syndrome are examples of such conditions.\n\nGilbert syndrome is a condition characterized by mild unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia, but it does not involve elevations in other liver function tests, so it fits the criteria for unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia being increased.\n\nHemolytic anaemia can cause unconjugated bilirubin to be increased due to hemolysis, which would also affect the results of other liver function tests.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer is C: Gilbert syndrome.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
