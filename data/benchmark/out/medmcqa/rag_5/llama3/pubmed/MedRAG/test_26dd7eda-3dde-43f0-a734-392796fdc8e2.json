["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents discuss the mechanisms of acquired specific resistance to Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection, including cytokine-mediated activation of parasitized host cells by protective T cells, and the lysis of these cells by cytolytic T cells. The report also mentions microbial defenses against killing by phagocytes, which suggests that microorganisms can evade oxygen-dependent killing by phagocytic cells. Considering this information, it is likely that a mediator involved in intracellular killing of microbes would be related to reactive oxygen species (ROS).\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
