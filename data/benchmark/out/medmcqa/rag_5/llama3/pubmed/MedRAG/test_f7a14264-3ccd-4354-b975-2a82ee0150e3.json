["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the major pattern of accessory canals in mandibular molar. The relevant document is 'Variations in the normal anatomy of the inferior dental (mandibular) canal: a retrospective study of panoramic radiographs from 3612 routine dental patients'. This study describes three distinct varieties of supplemental mandibular canals, but does not specifically mention mandibular molars. However, another document 'C-shaped canal configurations in mandibular molars' describes C-shaped mandibular second molars which have a different clinical finding compared to the preoperative radiograph. This suggests that there might be some variation in the normal anatomy of the inferior dental (mandibular) canal in mandibular molars, but it is not explicitly stated.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
