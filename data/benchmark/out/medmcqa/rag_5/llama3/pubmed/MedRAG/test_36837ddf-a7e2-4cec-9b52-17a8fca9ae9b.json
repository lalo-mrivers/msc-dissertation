["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents discuss the prevention of post-dural puncture headache. The first document talks about prophylactic treatment for spinal headache using epidural injection of saline or abdominal binder. The second document states that prophylactic blood patch does not prevent post-lumbar-puncture headache. The third document reviews literature on the cause, prevention, and treatments of post-dural puncture headache. It discusses the use of small-gauge needles, lateral approach, continuous epidural saline infusion, caffeine sodium benzoate, and epidural blood patching as effective strategies to decrease the risk of post-puncture dural headache. The fourth document reports a high incidence of postdural puncture headache in an orthopaedic population and suggests that an alternative technique may be needed.\n\nBased on this information, prophylactic supplementation of fluids does not appear to be a recommended strategy for decreasing the risk of post-puncture dural headache.\", \"answer_choice\": D}"]
