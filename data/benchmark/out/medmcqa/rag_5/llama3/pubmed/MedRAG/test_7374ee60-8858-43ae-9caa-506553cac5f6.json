["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the time required for pre-oxygenation before tracheal intubation. The relevant documents are about airway management, intubation, and tracheostomy. We can look at the document 'Rapid access airway: surgical device and technique' which mentions immediate temporary access to the subglottic airway for oxygenation or anesthesia induction. This suggests that pre-oxygenation is important before tracheal intubation. There are no specific time limits mentioned in this document. The document 'Emergency oxygen administration and airway management' does not provide specific information on pre-oxygenation times either. The documents 'Prolonged endotracheal intubation' and 'Tracheostomies. Indications, timing, and complications.' are more focused on prolonged intubation and tracheostomy procedures rather than pre-oxygenation. Finally, we can look at the document 'Awake tracheal intubation in anaesthesia' which does not provide any information on pre-oxygenation times either. Therefore, there is no clear evidence to suggest a specific time required for pre-oxygenation before tracheal intubation.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
