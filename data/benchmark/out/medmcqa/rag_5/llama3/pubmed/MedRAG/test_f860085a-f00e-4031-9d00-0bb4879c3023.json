["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about statements related to nasal fractures. The relevant documents discuss various aspects of nasal fractures, including their treatment, anatomy, and legal implications. The key points that can be gathered from the documents are: \n- Nasal fractures may require a delay in repair for stabilization and evaluation (Nasal fractures in adults).\n- Manipulation is not an effective method for treating nasal fractures, and releasing locked septal displacement is crucial for achieving good results (Nasal injuries).\n- Fractures of the anterior nasal spine are rare but should be considered in cases with other middle third facial fractures (Fracture of the anterior nasal spine).\n- X-ray examination has limited legal value due to high false positive and negative rates, and it may not provide medical information of great importance (Legal aspects).\n\nConsidering these points, we can analyze the given options:\n- Option A: Nasal fractures may be followed by bilateral ecchymosis and facial oedema even if they are minor. This is true, as mentioned in some sources.\n- Option B: There is no evidence in the provided documents that nasal fractures need to be reduced for a few weeks. In fact, the optimal time for reduction varies based on factors such as patient stabilization and evaluation.\n- Option C: Traumatic telecanthus may indeed complicate nasal fractures, as it can cause distortion of the nasal septum and other structures. This is mentioned in the documents (Nasal injuries).\n- Option D: The telescoping of the nasal complex into the frontal sinus due to nasal fracture is not explicitly stated in the provided documents.\n\nBased on this analysis, we can conclude that option B ('They may need to be reduced for a few weeks') is the only statement that is not supported by the given information.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
