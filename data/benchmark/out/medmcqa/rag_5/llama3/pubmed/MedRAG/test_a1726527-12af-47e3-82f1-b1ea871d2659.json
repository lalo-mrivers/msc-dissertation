["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the approved use of Nimodipine. We have to look at the documents for any mention of Nimodipine's approved use or treatment of a specific type of hemorrhage. In document 1, it is mentioned that the authors present their own experience in the treatment of 209 patients with subarachnoid haemorrhage with nimodipine. This suggests that Nimodipine was used to treat subarachnoid hemorrhage. In documents 2 and 4, there are mentions of clinical trials and studies involving Nimodipine for the treatment of subarachnoid hemorrhage and cerebral vasospasm. Document 3 discusses calcium-channel antagonists in cardiovascular disease, including Nimodipine's use in the treatment of hypertension and myocardial ischaemia. However, it does not mention its approved use for a specific type of hemorrhage.\", \"answer_choice\": D}"]
