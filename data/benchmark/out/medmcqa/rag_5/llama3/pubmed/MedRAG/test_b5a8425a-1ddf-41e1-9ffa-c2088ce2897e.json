["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the interaction between LDL and liver cells. In 'Hepatic clearance of plasma low density lipoproteins', it is mentioned that LDL uptake by the liver is mediated largely by receptor-dependent mechanisms, and 80 to 90% of whole body receptor-dependent LDL catabolism occurs in the liver. In 'Uptake and degradation of human low-density lipoprotein by human liver parenchymal and Kupffer cells in culture', it is shown that LDL binds to and is degraded by human liver parenchymal cells and human Kupffer cells, with the association being coupled to degradation. The ligand for receptors present in liver for uptake of LDL is likely Apo B-100, as it is a major apolipoprotein of LDL.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
