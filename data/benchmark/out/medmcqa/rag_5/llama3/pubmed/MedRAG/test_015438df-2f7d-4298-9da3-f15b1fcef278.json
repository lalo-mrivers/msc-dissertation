["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the provided documents, we know that contraction stresses of composite resin filling materials were measured. The results indicate that the stresses acting on the enamel are low compared to the tensile strength of the enamel. This suggests that polymerization shrinkage is not related to bonded or unbounded surface area (option A) nor is it high if within the enamel margins (option B). Additionally, acid etching and priming do not necessarily decrease polymerization shrinkage (option C), as shown by the experiment. Finally, microleakage can indeed occur due to polymerization shrinkage (option D), as described in the document.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
