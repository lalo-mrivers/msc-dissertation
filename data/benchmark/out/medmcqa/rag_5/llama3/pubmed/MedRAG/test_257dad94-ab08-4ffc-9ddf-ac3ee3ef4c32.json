["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about where guiding cusps occlude. According to the 'Application of \"cusp writer\" findings to practical and theoretical occlusal problems' document, the steepness of the curve of Spee determines the relative cusp height and angulation of one tooth to another, from an anterior to a posterior direction in the dental arch. This suggests that guiding cusps occlude as they are part of this anterior-to-posterior direction. Therefore, the correct answer is related to the embrassures.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"]
