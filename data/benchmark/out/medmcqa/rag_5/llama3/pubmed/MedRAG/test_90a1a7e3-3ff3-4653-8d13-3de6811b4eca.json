["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The provided table shows the effects of a new drug on heart rate, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and tremors. The placebo group has normal or baseline values for these parameters. The new drug treated group shows increased heart rate (728 vs 86), higher systolic blood pressure (150 vs 110), and increased diastolic blood pressure (68 vs 80). Additionally, the presence of tremors is noted only in the new drug treated group. Based on this information, it appears that the new drug is likely to be an agonist that acts on the sympathetic nervous system, causing increased heart rate, blood pressure, and potentially other effects such as tremors.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: Alpha-1 and beta-1 agonist\"\n}"]
