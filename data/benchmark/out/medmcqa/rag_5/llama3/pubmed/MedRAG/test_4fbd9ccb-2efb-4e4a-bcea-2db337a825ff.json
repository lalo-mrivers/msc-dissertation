["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to the documents provided, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can induce gastroduodenal ulcers and life-threatening complications. The mechanism of their anti-inflammatory action and their gastroduodenal toxic effects are related, in part, to inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis. This is mentioned in the first document. Additionally, it is stated that prostaglandins 'cytoprotect' the gastrointestinal mucosa from NSAID-induced ulceration at least in part through inhibitory effects on neutrophil function (second document). Furthermore, the third document discusses a procedure for measuring gastric bleeding caused by drugs and states that one day's treatment with aspirin increased the rate of blood loss significantly. Finally, the fourth document reviews various agents available for the treatment of NSAID-induced gastroduodenal mucosal damage, including prostaglandin analogs such as misoprostol.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
