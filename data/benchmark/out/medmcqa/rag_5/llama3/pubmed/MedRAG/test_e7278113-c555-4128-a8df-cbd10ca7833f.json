["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, we need to calculate the amount of drug eliminated from the body in 90 minutes. If the drug follows first-order kinetics, the elimination rate is proportional to the amount of drug remaining in the body. Let's call the initial amount of drug 200 mg and the amount remaining after 90 minutes x. The amount eliminated during this time is the difference between the initial and final amounts: 200 - x. Since the drug follows first-order kinetics, the elimination rate is proportional to x.\n\nThe amount eliminated in 90 minutes is equal to the integral of the elimination rate over that time period. If we assume a constant elimination rate, the integral can be approximated as the product of the average rate and the time:\n\n200 - x = k * (90)\n\nwhere k is the elimination rate constant.\n\nWe are given that 75 mg of the drug is eliminated in 90 minutes, so we can solve for x:\n\nx = 200 - 75\nx = 125\n\nNow that we know the amount remaining after 90 minutes, we can calculate the amount remaining after 6 hours. We will need to find the elimination rate constant k.\n\nThe terminal half-life of a drug is the time it takes for the amount of drug in the body to decrease by half. If the drug follows first-order kinetics, the terminal half-life is related to the elimination rate constant as:\n\nt1/2 = ln(2) / k\n\nWe are given that the terminal plasma half-lives (355 and 448 min) or in mean total body clearances (5.9 and 5.6 ml . min-1 . kg-1) following i.v. bolus injection or infusion respectively, which gives us a rough estimate of the elimination rate constant k.\n\nUsing these values, we can estimate that:\n\nk = ln(2) / t1/2\n= ln(2) / 355\n= approximately 0.00195 min-1\n\nNow that we have an estimate of k, we can calculate the amount remaining after 6 hours:\n\n6 hours = 360 minutes\n\nx = x0 * e^(-k*t)\n= 125 * e^(-0.00195*360)\n= approximately 12.5 mg\n\nSo, the answer is A: 12.5 mg.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
