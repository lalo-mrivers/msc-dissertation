["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the Beta 1,3 Glucan test being positive. The text does not mention Aspergillus or Mucormycosis directly, but it does mention Candida albicans as a common yeast pathogen. Additionally, the text describes beta-glucans as major structural components of yeast cell walls. This suggests that the Beta 1,3 Glucan test might be positive in Candida, as they are known to have beta-glucans in their cell walls. Pneumocystis Jirovecii is also mentioned as a fungal species, but it does not directly relate to beta-glucans.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
