["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"A recessive gene requires two copies of the gene (one from each parent) to express the condition. Since one parent is homozygous for the gene, they have two copies of the gene. The other parent is heterozygous, meaning they have one copy of the normal allele and one copy of the recessive allele. This means that every child will inherit at least one copy of the recessive allele from their homozygous parent, and half of the children will inherit two copies (one from each parent), resulting in 25% children being affected.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
