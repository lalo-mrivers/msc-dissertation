["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about drugs that require dose reduction in renal failure except. Since most drugs are excreted at least partially by the kidney, we need to look for specific information on these four drugs: Amphotericin B, Vancomycin, Gentamicin, and Doxycycline. Upon reviewing the provided documents, we see that the majority of the text focuses on adjusting dosage regimens in patients with renal failure, particularly for drugs usually eliminated by the kidneys. There is no specific mention of these four drugs requiring dose reduction in renal failure.
