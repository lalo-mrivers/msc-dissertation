["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents provided discuss epidural anesthesia and its complications. The mechanism of action of extradural analgesia mentions that local anaesthetic drugs injected into the extradural space may cause nerve blocks at three possible sites: (a) On the spinal nerves in the paravertebral space, (b) On the spinal nerves intradurally, or (c) On the spinal cord. There is no mention of platelets, aspirin, or oral anticoagulants as contraindications for centrineuraxial anesthesia. Raised intracranial pressure is not a contraindication either, as it may be related to the procedure itself rather than the anesthesia technique.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
