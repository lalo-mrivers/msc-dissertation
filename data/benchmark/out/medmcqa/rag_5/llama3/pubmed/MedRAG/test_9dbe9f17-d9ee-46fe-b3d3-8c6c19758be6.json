["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The research question involves comparing postpartum depression in mothers giving birth to male versus female children. Since the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) is used to assess postpartum depression, we need a test that compares two groups based on categorical data. The EPDS yields a score out of 30, which doesn't necessarily imply normal distribution or continuous variables. Therefore, a parametric test like Student's t-test or Paired t-test wouldn't be suitable. Instead, a non-parametric test like Chi-square test would be more appropriate to compare the outcomes.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
