["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about dehydration secondary to diarrhea, so the relevant documents are those related to treatment of diarrheal dehydration. In 'Treatment of diarrheal dehydration', a regimen for rehydration is presented, which involves infusion of a larger amount of fluid than generally recommended at the start of treatment. However, this document does not mention intravenous agents specifically. In 'Oral rehydration of neonates with dehydrating diarrhoeas', oral rehydration is discussed as being suitable for neonates and children, but no information about intravenous agents is provided.\n\nIn 'Sucrose in oral therapy for cholera and related diarrhoeas', glucose is mentioned as a preferable alternative to sucrose for oral therapy. However, this document does not provide information about intravenous agents either.\n\nFinally, in '[Dehydratation secondary to infantile acute diarrhea]', the focus is on parenteral rehydration, which implies that IV fluids are being used. This document provides rules of management of parenteral rehydration depending on the degree and type of fluid disturbance.\n\nBased on these documents, it appears that the most relevant information about intravenous agents comes from '[Dehydratation secondary to infantile acute diarrhea]', which discusses parenteral rehydration using IV fluids.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
