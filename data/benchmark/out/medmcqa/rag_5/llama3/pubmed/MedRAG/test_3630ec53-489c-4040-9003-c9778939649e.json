["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents describe the recycling of proteins between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi complex, with some proteins returning to the ER while others travel onwards. The Golgi complex is also described as having a transitional region with beadlike structures that can only be seen after staining in bismuth salts. This suggests that there is protein transport between the ER and Golgi complex. Additionally, the presence of an intermediate compartment between the ER and Golgi complex implies that there are sorting mechanisms at play. The regulation of vesicular and tubular membrane traffic by coat proteins also supports the idea that Golgi bodies function in sorting.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
