["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"After reviewing the documents, I found that Morris retractor is not mentioned explicitly. However, the description of self-retaining retractors in general surgery and their applications in laparoscopic cholecystectomy and microsurgical drainage of subretinal fluid suggests that it might be used for general surgical procedures.

This information provides a different context, unrelated to laparoscopic or microsurgical procedures.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: None\"\n}"]
