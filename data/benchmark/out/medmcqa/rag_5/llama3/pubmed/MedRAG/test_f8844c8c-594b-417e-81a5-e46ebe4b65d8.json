["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, we look at the documents provided. The first document talks about a multicentre trial to study the possibilities of first-trimester maternal serum screening for fetal chromosomal abnormalities. Maternal blood samples were obtained before 13 weeks of gestation. We see that alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) was one of the parameters measured in this trial. In the second document, we learn about current techniques of prenatal screening for Down syndrome, including evaluation of maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein levels. The third document discusses low maternal serum AFP values in the first trimester of pregnancy and their association with an increased risk for chromosome disorders. Finally, the fourth document talks about a study that uses individual risk to screen for Down's syndrome. We see that AFP was one of the parameters used in this study. Therefore, we can conclude that AFP is used for screening of Down's syndrome in the first trimester.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: AFP and Beta HCG\"\n}"]
