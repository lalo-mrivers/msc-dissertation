["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Firstly, we need to calculate the total number of live births. The total number of births is 456. Of these, 56 showed no signs of life at birth and 56 died before 28 days of life, so this leaves 444 live births. Then, 34 died between 28 days and 1 year, so the total infant mortality is 90 (56 + 56). This means that the infant mortality rate is equal to 90/444, which simplifies to approximately 20.3%. We then need to convert this percentage to a rate per 1000 live births, which gives us approximately 203.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
