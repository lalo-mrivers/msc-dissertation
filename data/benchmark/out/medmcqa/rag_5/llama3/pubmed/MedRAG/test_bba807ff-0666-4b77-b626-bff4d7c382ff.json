["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the type of strain developed when force is applied perpendicular to a surface. Since the force is applied perpendicular to the surface, it would cause the material to compress or shorten along that direction. This is consistent with the definition of compressive strain, which occurs when an object is compressed or shortened in one direction.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
