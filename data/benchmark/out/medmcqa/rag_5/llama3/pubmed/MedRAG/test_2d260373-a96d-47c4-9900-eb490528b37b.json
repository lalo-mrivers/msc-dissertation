["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Upon reviewing the provided documents, I found that the topic of pulpless abutments, root abutments, and implants is discussed. The use of these techniques is aimed at providing additional retention and stability for complete or partial dentures. However, none of the documents specifically mention supplementary retention on the abutment tooth being made possible by greater bulk of metal, proper cementation technique, shoulder preparation, or proper use of pins and grooves.
