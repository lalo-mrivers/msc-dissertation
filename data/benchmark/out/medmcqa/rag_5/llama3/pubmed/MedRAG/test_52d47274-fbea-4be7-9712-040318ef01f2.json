["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks for the drug of choice for treatment of infection involving non-penicillinase producing staphylococcus. We know that methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections are resistant to beta-lactam antibiotics, including penicillin and cephalosporins. Therefore, we can rule out options A, C, and D. The document also states that vancomycin remains the drug of choice for MRSA infections. Since non-penicillinase producing staphylococcus is not specifically mentioned as being resistant to vancomycin, we can infer that this refers to methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA). Clindamycin phosphate was found to be a satisfactory substitute for methicillin in soft tissue infections due to gram-positive organisms. Therefore, the drug of choice is likely to be either clindamycin or vancomycin.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
