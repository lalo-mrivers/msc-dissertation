["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the wedging technique to be used for amalgam restoration in a cavity with a proximal box wide buccolingually. Since there is a wide space, we need to choose the technique that will effectively fill this space. The relevant document for amalgam restorations suggests that all uniformly mixed, carefully placed base forming materials that have reached the state of 'clinical set' are able to withstand loads applied during amalgam condensation irrespective of their strength. This indicates that the choice of wedging technique depends on the adaptation of the amalgam to the cavity walls. The document 'Adaptation of amalgams to cavity walls' shows that fillings made from contracting materials have a slit formation and marginal defects, whereas those made from expanding or balanced materials have good contact with the cavity wall and small scattered defects.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A: Double wedge\""]
