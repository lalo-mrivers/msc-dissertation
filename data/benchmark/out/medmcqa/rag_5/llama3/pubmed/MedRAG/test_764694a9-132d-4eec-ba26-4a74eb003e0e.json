["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The cephalic index (CI) is the ratio of biparietal diameter to occipitofrontal diameter. The question asks about a CI between 70-74.9%. We need to find which option corresponds to this range.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom the provided documents, we can find the values for different cephalic indices. In 'Neonatal and maternal cranial form', it is mentioned that the mean cephalic index in the normally grown full-term neonate is in the lower eighties, but there's no specific value provided.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 'The differential enlargement of the neurocranium in the full-term fetus', it is stated that the cephalic index rises as birth weight increases. However, this document does not provide a specific range for the CI.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are no other documents mentioning specific values for the cephalic index.\\r\\n\\r\\nTherefore, we can't find any direct correlation between the given range (70-74.9%) and the options provided.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C\n}"]
