["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the color of urine. The relevant information comes from the document 'Rapid detection of amphetamine in urine by micro thin-layer chromatography and fluorescence'. It states that when viewed under ultraviolet illumination, amphetamines and other compounds with a primary amino group complexed with fluorescamine appear as greenish or bluish-white fluorescent spots. Since the question asks about an orange color, it is not related to amphetamine or fluorescamine. The question is not related to any of the provided documents except for 'Studies on fluorescamine: Part I--Applications of fluorescamine in forensic toxicological analysis'. This document only talks about the reaction between primary amines and fluorescamine, which does not apply to this question.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
