["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the provided documents, I can see that none of the options directly relate to determining the sensitivity of vaccine due to heat. However, I can recall that thermal degradation test was used to evaluate the thermostability of BCG vaccines in one of the documents. This suggests that a temperature-based parameter might be relevant. Upon reviewing the stability tests for freeze-dried and reconstituted measles vaccines, I notice that the accelerated stability test at 37 degrees C for 7 days is used to predict the potency of each lot. This implies that the sensitivity of vaccine due to heat might be related to its ability to withstand temperatures.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
