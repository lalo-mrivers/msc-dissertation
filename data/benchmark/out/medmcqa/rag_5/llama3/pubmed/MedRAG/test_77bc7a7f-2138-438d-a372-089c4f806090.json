["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the presence of microvilli in a specific location. We can start by analyzing the provided documents to find information about microvilli in different parts of the body. From The structure of the enterocyte in relation to its position on the villus in childhood: an electron microscopical study, we know that microvilli are present in the small intestine and their surface area is maximal in the mid-region of the villus. This suggests that microvilli are important for digestion and absorption.\n\nFrom The mechanism of epithelial shedding after ischemic damage to the small intestinal mucosa., we can infer that microvilli are also present at the base of the villi, as they detach from the basement membrane in response to ischemia.\n\nThe other documents do not provide specific information about microvilli in the gallbladder, duodenum, collecting duct, or proximal convoluted tubule. Therefore, we can conclude that the presence of microvilli is likely a characteristic of small intestinal mucosa and possibly other parts of the gastrointestinal tract.\n\nBased on this analysis, we can eliminate options B, D, and C as they do not have a direct correlation with the provided information about microvilli.\n\nOption A refers to the gallbladder, which is a part of the biliary system. While it is possible that microvilli are present in the gallbladder, this document does not provide specific information on the topic. Therefore, option A remains a possibility.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the provided documents and our analysis, we cannot definitively say that microvilli are absent from the gallbladder.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
