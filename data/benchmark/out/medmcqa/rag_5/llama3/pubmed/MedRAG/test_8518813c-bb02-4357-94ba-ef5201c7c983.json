["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has oral cancer of stage T3N2M0. The documents provided discuss various aspects of head and neck cancer, including the importance of laterality in neck node metastases, the correlation between histologic features and the prevalence of lymph node metastasis, and the prognostic value of cytometric DNA analysis in early stage tongue cancer. Based on this information, we can infer that surgery is likely to be a part of the treatment plan for the patient's T3 tumor. The documents also suggest that radiotherapy may be used in combination with surgery to improve outcomes. There is no direct evidence supporting the use of chemotherapy alone or chemotherapy and surgery simultaneously. Therefore, our answer should prioritize surgery and potentially combine it with radiotherapy.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B\n}"]
