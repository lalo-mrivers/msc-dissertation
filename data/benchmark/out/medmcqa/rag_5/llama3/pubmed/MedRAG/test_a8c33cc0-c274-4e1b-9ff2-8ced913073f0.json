["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents provided information about agar-hydrocolloid impression materials. According to the document '[Technological aspects of agar-hydrocolloid impression materials]', we can see that this type of material is characterized by poor elasticity and strength, requiring a lot of bulk material to prevent damage during manipulation. The gelation process does not seem to be temperature-dependent, as there is no mention of an increase in gelation with increased temperature. Additionally, the document highlights the importance of using much bulk material to prevent deformation during removal of the impression.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
