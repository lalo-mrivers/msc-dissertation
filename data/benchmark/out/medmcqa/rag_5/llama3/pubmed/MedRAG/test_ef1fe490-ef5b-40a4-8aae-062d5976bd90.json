["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the range for the 90% confidence interval, we need to calculate the mean and standard deviation. The problem states that the average GFR is 85 ml/min with a standard deviation of 25. Since the sample size is not provided, we cannot use statistical formulas to calculate the 90% confidence interval directly. However, we can use the given information about the normalisation of glomerular filtration rate measurements to determine the range for the 90% confidence interval.\",\n\"answer_choice\": A\n}"]
