["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about junctional epithelium. We need to find the relevant information from the provided documents that describes this type of epithelium. From 'Epithelium--connective tissue interface of oral mucous membranes', we can infer that junctional epithelium is related to the epithelial-connective tissue interface, which is important in oral mucous membranes. However, this document does not provide specific information about junctional epithelium. In 'Structure, function, and regulation of cellular tight junctions', we see a mention of tight junctions, but no information about junctional epithelium. The other documents do not provide relevant information either. Therefore, we can only rely on the description provided in 'Cellular junctions in human oesophageal epithelium'. According to this document, junctional epithelium is related to the attachment of cells to each other and the connective tissue.\",\n\"answer_choice\": A"]
