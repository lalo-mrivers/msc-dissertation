["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The provided documents describe the anatomy of various brain structures. We can find information about the course of the peripheral gustatory nerves, which indicate that the IX cranial nerve carries fibers from the posterior part of the tongue to the medulla oblongata. The Structure of physiologically identified X and Y cells in the cat's lateral geniculate nucleus suggests that neurons with similar functions (X and Y cells) can be found together. This information is relevant because it provides context for understanding the anatomy of cranial nerves IX, X, and XI. After reviewing these documents, we can infer that the Nucleus ambiguus is a common nucleus in brain to IX, X, and XI cranial nerves.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
