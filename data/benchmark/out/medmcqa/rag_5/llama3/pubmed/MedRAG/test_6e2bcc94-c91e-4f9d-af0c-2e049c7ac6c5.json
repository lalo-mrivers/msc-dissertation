["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the given documents, we can conclude that normal blood pressure is typically lower at night than during the day. Therefore, it's unlikely that the systolic blood pressure would have a mean of 130 for this age group. In fact, the document 'A study of the normal range of blood pressure in the aged New Zealand male' states that there was no relationship between arterial pressure and increasing age for males 60 years of age and over. The same document also mentions that arterial pressure did not vary significantly during the day for this age group.\n\nAdditionally, the document 'Reference values for the ambulatory blood pressure and the blood pressure measured at home: a population study' provides reference values for daytime ambulatory pressures in men aged greater than or equal to 50 years. The 95th centiles are 154/90 mmHg, which is much higher than the given mean of 130.\n\nTherefore, it's likely that people with systolic blood pressure more than 130 will be individuals who have high blood pressure for their age group, rather than those whose blood pressure is simply at or above the average.\", \n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
