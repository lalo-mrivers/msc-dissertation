["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the direction to gain access to the Mesiofacial root of permanent maxillary first molar, we need to consider the morphology of root and pulp canals. The question does not provide information about the canal morphology, but we have relevant documents that describe the anatomy of maxillary premolars. According to the document 'Root form and canal anatomy of maxillary first premolars', 55.8% of the teeth had a single root, and considering all of the first premolars, 80.4% had two canals. This information suggests that the Mesiofacial root is likely to be one of the two roots in the majority of cases. Therefore, we should consider the canal anatomy of maxillary first premolars to determine the direction to access the Mesiofacial root.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
