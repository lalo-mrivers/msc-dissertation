["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The case presented is that of a 10-month-old child with non-eruption of teeth. Natal teeth are mentioned in the document 'Management of natal teeth' as being removed after obtaining parents' consent and ruling out neonatal hypoprothrombinemia.

Therefore, the most likely scenario is that the child has natal teeth, and the protocol would involve obtaining dental radiographs, if possible, before removing them to advise parents of any complications.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
