["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Axonal transport is classified into fast and slow components. Slow axonal transport is maintained by a smaller pool of moving subunits or polymers. Calcium ions are involved in the initiation of axonal transport. Rapid axonal transport is mediated by motor proteins such as kinesin. Therefore, rapid axonal flow is not mediated by dynein.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
