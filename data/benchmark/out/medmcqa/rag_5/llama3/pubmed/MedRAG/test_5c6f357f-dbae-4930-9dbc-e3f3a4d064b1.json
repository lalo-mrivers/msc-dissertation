["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for dental auxiliary materials except. Dental auxiliary materials are those used by dental assistants or hygienists to help the dentist with various procedures. The options provided are: dental impression wax, ceramic, casting investment, and impression compound. Upon reviewing the relevant documents, it can be seen that dental composites, resin cements, dental amalgams, ceramic materials, and other restorative materials are not used by dental assistants or hygienists. Therefore, these materials are not auxiliary dental materials. Ceramic is actually a type of restorative material, not an auxiliary material. Dental impression wax, casting investment, and impression compound are all auxiliary dental materials used in the process of taking impressions.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
