["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about hormones that act by crossing the cell membrane. The provided documents describe different types of hormone receptors and their interactions with hormones. From these descriptions, we can see that some hormones bind to membrane-bound receptors, while others interact with nuclear or cytoplasmic receptors. This information helps us identify which hormones are likely to cross the cell membrane. In particular, steroids like thyroxine, glucagon, and calcitonin are known to pass through the plasma membrane, whereas insulin is a polypeptide hormone that binds to membrane-bound receptors.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
