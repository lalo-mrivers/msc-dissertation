["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the least change in insulin function if we make a certain change to its structure. The relevant documents provide information on sequence changes, three-dimensional structure, and the role of various parts of this structure in insulin function. From these documents, it can be inferred that sequence changes can affect the conversion of proinsulin molecule to active form, storage of insulin, transport to site of action, and interaction with receptor. Therefore, we need to look for an option that does not significantly alter these processes. Among the options provided, breaking disulphide linkages (option D) is likely to have minimal impact on insulin function as it only affects a specific type of chemical bond.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
