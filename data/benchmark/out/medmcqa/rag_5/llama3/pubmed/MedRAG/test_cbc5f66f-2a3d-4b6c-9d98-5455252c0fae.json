["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about dynamic creep. Dynamic creep refers to the phenomenon where a material's length increases while its force remains constant, which is described in the first document as 'creep phenomenon, retardation'. This concept is also mentioned in the last document under the topic of 'creep behavior' of glass-ionomer materials. Since the other options are not related to creep, it can be inferred that dynamic creep refers to the process of deformation over time under constant force.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
