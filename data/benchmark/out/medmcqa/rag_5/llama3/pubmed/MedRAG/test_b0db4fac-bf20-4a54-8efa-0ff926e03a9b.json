["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe polyglycolic acid (PGA) as a synthetic absorbable suture material. Specifically, it is mentioned as 'Dexon' or 'Vicryl'. This information can be found in multiple studies, including 'Dexon versus conventional sutures in hernia repair', 'Clinical comparison of polyglactic acid (Vicryl) and polytrimethylene carbonate (Maxon) suture material', and 'Polyglycolic acid (PGA, Dexon) sutures in neck surgery'. Therefore, the correct answer is that Polyglycolic acid suture material ('Vicryl/Dexon') is an absorbable synthetic suture.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
