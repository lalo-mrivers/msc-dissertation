["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the incidence of extra canal in mandibular 1st molar. There are no documents that specifically mention this information. However, one document mentions the radiographic incidence of multiple roots and canals in human mandibular premolars. According to this study, the first premolars were involved in 15.7% of patients, and second premolars in 7%. Since we are looking at mandibular 1st molar, which is different from premolars, we cannot directly apply these percentages. Nevertheless, it gives us an idea that there might be some incidence of extra canal or multiple roots/canals in mandibular molars. \",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
