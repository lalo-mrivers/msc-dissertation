["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for the causative agent of an increased BT (blood test) in a healthy volunteer who denied exposure to NSAIDs. The provided documents mention various biochemical and haematological tests performed on healthy volunteers, which found 11% incidence of abnormal results. In another study, 46 abnormal values were found in laboratory tests among 29 healthy young male volunteers. These findings suggest that normal ranges for test results should be realistic and not too rigid. Additionally, the prevalence of Mycoplasma pneumoniae was investigated in subjectively healthy individuals, which showed a fluctuating but significant number of individuals with positive serology.\n\nThe focus is on identifying potential causative agents of increased BT. The study on volunteers' biochemical and haematological tests found 11% incidence of abnormal results, implying that the increased BT could be related to various factors rather than just NSAIDs. Moreover, the study on baseline symptoms in healthy persons highlights the importance of considering normal fluctuations in human physiology.\n\nThe potential causative agents mentioned in the provided documents are Theophylline (mentioned as a local laboratory test result), Cephalosporin and Anti-depressants (both are types of medications that could be responsible for increased BT). Multivitamins containing Vitamin K do not seem to have any direct relation to increased BT.\n\nTherefore, considering these findings and the potential causative agents mentioned, it can be concluded that Theophylline is a possible cause of increased BT.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
