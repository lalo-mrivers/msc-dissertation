["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about true statements regarding methanol poisoning. We can analyze each option to identify the exception. Option A is incorrect because fomepizole is a competitive inhibitor of formigene dehydrogenase, not aldehyde dehydrogenase. Options B and C are both supported by the provided documents. The minimum lethal dose of methanol is not explicitly stated in the documents, but it's reasonable to assume that it might be higher than 1.25 ml/kg body weight considering that the case study reported a patient with severe intoxication who survived after treatment. Formic acid is indeed mentioned as a main contributor to toxicity. Finally, option D seems plausible since snow field vision is an unusual symptom of methanol poisoning, which can cause blindness.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
