["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents highlight the importance of avoiding drugs that can cause fetal damage or malformations during pregnancy. The papers emphasize the need for healthcare professionals to familiarize themselves with the special needs of drug-exposed infants and to take precautions when prescribing medications during this period. Additionally, the documents note that hormonal contraceptives may have teratogenic effects, although conclusive evidence is lacking. A recent survey also showed a positive correlation between congenital anomalies and drug intake during pregnancy.\n\nConsidering these findings, we can infer that certain drugs are contraindicated in pregnancy due to their potential risks to the fetus. Specifically, hypertensive drugs like Enalapril (A) may pose a risk to the developing child. The documents also mention the importance of avoiding hormonal contraceptives during pregnancy, which supports the contraindication of these medications.\n\nIn contrast, other antihypertensive medications like Amlodipine (B) and beta blockers (C) are not explicitly mentioned as being contraindicated in pregnancy. Although their use may still pose some risks, the available information does not provide conclusive evidence against their use during this period.\n\nFinally, Propylthiouracil (D) is an antithyroid medication that is sometimes used to treat hyperthyroidism and Graves' disease during pregnancy. Its use in pregnancy is generally considered safe, as it helps to prevent fetal goiter and promotes normal thyroid function.\n\nBased on the available information, Enalapril (A) appears to be the drug most likely to be contraindicated in pregnancy due to its potential risks to the fetus.\",\n\"answer_choice\": A"]
