["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the disadvantages of grids. The relevant documents are from different fields such as medical expert systems, age-sex register, and physician shortages. None of these documents mention skin exposure of patient, increase exposure time, or overall density of radiograph being increased. Therefore, we can safely eliminate options D and B. The remaining options A and C do not seem to be related to grids in the context of medical imaging. However, one document mentions 'Problems of repertory grid analysis' which suggests that grids are a type of data analysis tool. We can consider this possibility. In that case, option C 'Doesn't improve image' seems more relevant as it is a common critique of data analysis methods, including Repertory Grid Analysis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"]
