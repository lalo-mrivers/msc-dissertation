["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe decidual cells in the human ovary at term, gene expression during oogenesis in mice, induced ovulation in mature mice, and the formation of cortical granules in ovarian oocytes. The question asks about the development of granules in a cell before ovulation. Decidual cells are engaged in secretory activity, exhibiting characteristics such as rough and smooth endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi complex, and dense bodies. Similarly, cortical granules are produced by the participation of both the Golgi complex and the rough endoplasmic reticulum. This suggests that the development of granules is dependent on the maturation process involving these organelles.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
