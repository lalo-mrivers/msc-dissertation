["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to the provided documents, penicillin remains the recommended prophylactic agent for secondary prevention of rheumatic fever. However, since the question is about a patient who is allergic to penicillin, we need to look for alternative options. The relevant document 'Allergic reactions to long-term benzathine penicillin prophylaxis for rheumatic fever' mentions that long-term parenteral benzathine penicillin can be used as prophylaxis, but this option is not suitable for a patient allergic to penicillin. Therefore, we need to look for alternative antibacterial agents. The document 'Explanations and therapies for penicillin failure in streptococcal pharyngitis' mentions that cephalosporins, amoxicillin/clavulanate, and the extended-spectrum macrolides represent logical options under clinical circumstances where penicillin treatment fails. Since this is a prophylactic scenario, we need to consider an agent that can prevent rheumatic fever.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
