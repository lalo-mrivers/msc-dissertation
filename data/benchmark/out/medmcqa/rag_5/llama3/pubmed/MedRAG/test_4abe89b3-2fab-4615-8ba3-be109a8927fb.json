["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe changes in the dental arch during changing dentition. One document discusses maxillary anterior displacement and impaction in the mixed dentition. This suggests that teeth in the upper jaw can be displaced due to arch size discrepancies. Since the question is about a tooth in the mandibular arch, we need to look for information on how teeth in the lower jaw are affected by arch size discrepancies. The document 'Morphologic evidence of muscle influence on dental arch width' discusses changes in arch width during correction of distoclusion with an activator appliance. This suggests that the tongue and cheek muscles can affect the shape of the dental arch, including the mandibular arch. Therefore, we should look for information on how these muscles influence the teeth in the lower jaw. The document 'The role of third molars in the cause of anterior arch crowding' discusses the relationship between third molars and dental crowding. While this is not directly relevant to the question, it does suggest that tooth size can affect the shape of the dental arch.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the information provided, a tooth in the mandibular arch that is most likely to be displaced due to an arch size discrepancy is the first molar.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
