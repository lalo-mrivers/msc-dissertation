["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the maximum spherocytes. We can find this information from the provided documents. The first document talks about membrane structure and its relation to haemolysis. It does not mention autoimmune hemolytic anemia, Vit B12 deficiency, or aplastic anemia. The second document discusses measurements of cell volume and hemoglobin concentration of erythrocytes from hereditary ovalocytosis and hereditary spherocytosis. It mentions that the patient with hereditary spherocytosis (HS) had decreased MCV 77.4 fL, microcytes 14.7 per cent, and increased RDW 22.3 per cent. This suggests that hereditary spherocytosis is associated with an increase in spherocytes. The other options do not seem to be related to spherocytosis.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: None\""]
