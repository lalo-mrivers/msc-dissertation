["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the most common organism responsible for acute apical abscess. None of the provided documents explicitly mention the most common organism. However, we can look at general knowledge and dental texts to answer this question. Acute apical abscesses are typically caused by bacterial infections. Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguis, and Fusobacterium nucleatum are some of the most common bacteria associated with acute apical abscesses. Treponema denticola is a spirochaete that has been linked to periodontal diseases, but it's not typically associated with acute apical abscesses. Dilaster invisus doesn't seem to be a real bacterium. E. faecalis can cause urinary tract infections, but it's not commonly associated with dental abscesses.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
