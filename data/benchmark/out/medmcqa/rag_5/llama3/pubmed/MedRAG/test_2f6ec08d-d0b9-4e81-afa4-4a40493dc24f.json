["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the effect of increased filler particle size on composite properties. From the given documents, we can relate this to the 'Surface roughness of composite filling materials' and 'Relationship between abrasive wear and microstructure of composite resins'. These documents suggest that smaller filler particles lead to better polishability and wear resistance. Therefore, increasing the size of filler particles would likely have the opposite effect.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
