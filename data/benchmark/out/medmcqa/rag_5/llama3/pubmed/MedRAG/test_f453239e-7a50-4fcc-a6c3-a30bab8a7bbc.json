["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The provided documents are related to glucose determination, its metabolism, and enzyme activities. There is no direct information about the biochemical description of glucose. However, one document discusses the kinetic determination of glucose concentrations with glucose dehydrogenase, which implies that glucose can be present in different forms or structures. Another document reviews some quantitative aspects of glucose metabolism in isolated pancreatic islets, but it does not provide a biochemical description of glucose. Therefore, we need to rely on general knowledge about sugars and their biochemical descriptions.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
