["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, I will consider the patient's history and the potential causes of thyroid storm. The patient underwent thyroidectomy for hyperthyroidism, and two days later, he presented with features of thyroid storm. This suggests that the surgery may have triggered or uncovered an underlying condition leading to thyroid storm. Considering the options, poor antibiotic coverage (A) seems unlikely as it would not directly cause thyroid storm. Rough handling during surgery (B) could be a possibility but is not specifically mentioned in the documents. Removal of parathyroid (C) is also possible but requires further investigation. Inadequate preoperative preparation (D) seems like a more likely cause, considering that the patient had hyperthyroidism before the surgery and developed thyroid storm after it.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
