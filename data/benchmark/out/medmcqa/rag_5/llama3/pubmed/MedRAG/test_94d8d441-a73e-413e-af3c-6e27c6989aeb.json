["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the provided documents, we know that the primary endoderm cells are derived from the inner cell mass (ICM). The ICM is responsible for generating both the foetal primordia and extraembryonic membranes. We also know that the primitive endoderm forms only extra-embryonic endoderm of the conceptus, while the primitive ectoderm forms the entire foetus, including its endodermal components. Therefore, we can conclude that the cells of endodermal origin are those found in the extra-embryonic membranes and not those found in the foetal primordia.\n\nLooking at the options, epithelial cells of intestine are indeed found in the extra-embryonic membranes (visceral yolk sac) as mentioned in document 1. Odontoblasts are responsible for forming teeth, which is a different tissue altogether. Goblet cells are also not related to endodermal origin.\n\nHepatocytes are liver cells, which are indeed of endodermal origin. They are formed from the primitive endoderm and can be found in both extra-embryonic membranes (visceral yolk sac) and foetal primordia (liver).\n\nTherefore, all except hepatocytes are of endodermal origin.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
