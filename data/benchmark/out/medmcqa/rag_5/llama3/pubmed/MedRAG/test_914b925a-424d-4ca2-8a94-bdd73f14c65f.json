["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"After reviewing the provided documents, I did not find any information that directly answers the question about which condition does not complicate into CHF (Congestive Heart Failure). However, I can examine the options and see if there is any connection to cardiac conditions or structures. The first three options (A-C) relate to congenital heart defects, which can be a complication of CHF.
