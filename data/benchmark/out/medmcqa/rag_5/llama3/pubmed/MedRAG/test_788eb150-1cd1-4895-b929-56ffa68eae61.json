["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the provided documents, we can see that maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein (MS-AFP) values are elevated in pregnancies with low birth-weight infants. The document 'Maternal serum-alpha-fetoprotein measurements as an early indicator of low birth-weight' suggests that MS-AFP values above 2-3 times the median value for the stage of gestation are associated with a higher risk of premature delivery and low birth-weight infants.\n\nWe can also see from this document that at higher multiples of the median serum-A.F.P. value, the proportion of pregnancies leading to low-birth-weight infants is even greater.\n\nOmphalocele and gastroschisis are both types of congenital abdominal wall defects that are associated with elevated MS-AFP values. In fact, 'alpha-fetoprotein and screening markers of congenital disease' suggests that AFP is produced in the gut during fetal life and appears to act like albumin in the adult.\n\nTherefore, maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein values would be highest in Omphalocele or Gastroschisis.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B: Omphalocele\"\n}"]
