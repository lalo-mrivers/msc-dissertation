["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the documents provided, it is clear that BCG vaccine has been extensively used for various purposes, including prevention and treatment of tuberculosis. The document 'New use of BCG for recombinant vaccines' suggests that BCG can be used as a vehicle to deliver protective antigens against multiple pathogens. This implies that BCG has been tested against different types of infections. In the document 'Lack of protection afforded by ribonucleic acid preparations from Mycobacterium tuberculosis against Mycobacterium leprae infections in mice', it is stated that suspensions of intact H37Ra (an attenuated strain of M. tuberculosis) were not effective against M. leprae, but BCG gave distinct protection against M. leprae challenge. This suggests that BCG has been found to be protective against leprosy. Considering the documents and their content, it is reasonable to assume that BCG is maximally protective against extra-pulmonary TB.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
