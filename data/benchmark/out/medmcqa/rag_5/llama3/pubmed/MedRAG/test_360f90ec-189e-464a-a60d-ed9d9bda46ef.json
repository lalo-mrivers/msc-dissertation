["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents do not mention the usual weight of rabbit used in ophthalmological experiments. However, we can look for information about the weight of eyes or orbits, which might give us an idea of the overall weight of the rabbit. In 'Ocular measurement by simple gravimetric methods', it is mentioned that rabbit eyes were weighed in air and then in water. The text states that eyes between 2.4 and 3.4 gm were used, and the difference between paired eyes was always less than 1%. This suggests that the weight of a single eye is likely to be around 2-3 grams. Since there are two eyes, we can estimate the total weight of the rabbit's head or upper body to be around 4-6 grams. However, this is not representative of the overall weight of the rabbit.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
