["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The passage 'Relapse/reinfection patterns of Plasmodium vivax infection: a four year study' explains that relapse/reinfection in P. vivax cases poses serious problems for the malaria control program and that all the P. vivax cases were given a complete course of radical treatment and were followed-up for relapse/reinfection. It also states that relapses were more common among 16-30 years old patients. This suggests that relapse is not caused by the initial infection itself but rather by some other mechanism. The passage 'The hypnozoite and relapse in primate malaria' explains that a latent stage for Plasmodium spp. in the liver, known as hypnozoites, best explains both the relapse phenomenon and the long prepatent periods seen with some strains of P. vivax. This supports the idea that relapse is caused by hypnozoites.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
