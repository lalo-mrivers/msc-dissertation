["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Since the question is about KLK4 gene mutation, I need to review the provided documents for any information related to amelogenesis imperfecta. In X-linked amelogenesis imperfecta, it mentions two kindreds and a review of the literature, but no specific mention of KLK4 gene mutation.
