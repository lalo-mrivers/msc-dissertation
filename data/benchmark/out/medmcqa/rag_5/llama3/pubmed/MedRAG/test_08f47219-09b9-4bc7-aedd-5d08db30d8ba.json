["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The Turku sugar studies were related to the effects of sucrose, fructose, and xylitol on human health. Specifically, Study XI investigated the effects of these sugars on glucose, lipid, and urate metabolism, while Study XIII analyzed the effect of these diets on certain clinico-chemical values in serum. Additionally, other documents discussed the relationship between blood sugar and blood pressure, as well as the metabolic response to carbohydrate ingestion. All these studies suggest that xylitol and fructose do not induce significant changes in liver function tests or serum levels of electrolytes, ascorbate, or enzymes when compared to sucrose.\", \"answer_choice\": C}"]
