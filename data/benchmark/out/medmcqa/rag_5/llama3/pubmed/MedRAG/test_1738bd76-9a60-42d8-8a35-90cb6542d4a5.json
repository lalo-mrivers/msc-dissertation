["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks which amino acid is quickly converted to tyrosine. The relevant document for this question is 'Amino acid precursors of monoamine neurotransmitters and some factors influencing their supply to the brain'. According to this document, L-tyrosine and L-tryptophan are aromatic amino acid precursors that can be converted into monoamine neurotransmitters within the brain. This means that these two amino acids have a direct relationship with tyrosine. Additionally, another relevant document is 'Specific sulfonation of tyrosine, tryptophan and hydroxy-amino acids in peptides', which indicates that tyrosinase converts serine and threonine into O-sulfate ester derivatives, while tyrosine and tryptophan are converted into arylsulfonic acids. This further supports the connection between tryptophan and tyrosine. Given this information, it is likely that tryptophan is quickly converted to tyrosine.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
