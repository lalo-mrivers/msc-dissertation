["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The problem starts by stating that the initial substrate concentration is 1000 times the Km value of the enzyme. This means that the substrate concentration is much higher than the Michaelis-Menten constant. The reaction proceeds for 9 minutes, during which time 17% of the substrate (12 microgram/ml) is converted to product.\n\nThe problem then changes the initial conditions by reducing the enzyme concentration by a factor of 3 and doubling the substrate concentration. We need to find out how much time it would take to convert the same amount of substrate into product, i.e., 12 microgram/ml.\n\nTo solve this problem, we can use the Michaelis-Menten equation to relate the initial substrate concentration, enzyme concentration, and reaction time. However, since the problem does not provide the exact values for these parameters, we need to make some assumptions or simplifications to proceed further.\n\nOne way to approach this problem is to assume that the reaction follows a simple first-order kinetics, which means that the rate of conversion of substrate into product is directly proportional to the concentration of substrate and enzyme. In this case, we can use the integrated form of the Michaelis-Menten equation to relate the initial substrate concentration, enzyme concentration, and reaction time.\n\nUsing the given information, we can set up an equation that relates the initial substrate concentration (1000 times the Km value), enzyme concentration, and reaction time. This would allow us to calculate the new reaction time required to convert 12 microgram/ml of substrate into product under the changed conditions.\", \n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
