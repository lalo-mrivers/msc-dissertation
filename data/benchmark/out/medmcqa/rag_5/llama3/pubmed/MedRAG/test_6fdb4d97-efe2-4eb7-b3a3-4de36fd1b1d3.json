["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the factors determining GFR. We can see from the documents that GFR is determined by a method for calculating glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in the individual patient from plasma creatinine concentration only, which involves the urinary excretion rate of creatinine (u), plasma concentration of creatinine (p), and the regression of endogenous creatinine clearance on GFR. Additionally, we can see that structural and functional adaptation after reduction of nephron population shows compensatory increases in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) at the level of individual nephrons. Determination of glomerular filtration rate in advanced renal insufficiency also mentions different clearance techniques using creatinine, inulin and 51Cr-EDTA as filtration markers. From these documents, it is clear that GFR is not solely determined by haemodynamic factors such as aerial pressure or resistance, but rather by a combination of physiological processes.\", \"answer_choice\": D}"]
