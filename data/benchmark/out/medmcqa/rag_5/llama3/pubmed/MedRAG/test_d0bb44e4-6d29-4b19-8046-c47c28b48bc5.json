["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the provided documents, we can find information about the composition of dentin. In 'The role of extracellular matrix components in dentin mineralization', it is mentioned that the extracellular matrix of dentin consists of mineral (hydroxyapatite), collagen, and several noncollagenous matrix proteins. This suggests that a significant portion of dentin is composed of mineral. Additionally, in 'Dentin proteins: chemistry, structure and biosynthesis', it is stated that one of the most abundant noncollagenous proteins of dentin is a phosphoprotein rich in aspartic acid and phosphoserine, which occurs in soluble and inextractable forms, the latter being associated with the insoluble collagenous matrix. This further supports the idea that a significant portion of dentin is composed of mineral.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A: 70% inorganic\"\n}"]
