["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the provided documents, membranous glomerulonephritis is characterized by immunoglobulin deposition on the basement membrane. The documents also state that the deposits are sparing of the mesangium. Since the patient presents with proteinuria and the immunofluorescence staining pattern shows IgG deposition on the basement membrane, it is likely a case of membranous glomerulonephritis. This diagnosis can be confirmed by electron microscopy, which would show the presence of immunoglobulin deposits along the basement membrane. The other options do not fit the described immunofluorescence staining pattern.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
