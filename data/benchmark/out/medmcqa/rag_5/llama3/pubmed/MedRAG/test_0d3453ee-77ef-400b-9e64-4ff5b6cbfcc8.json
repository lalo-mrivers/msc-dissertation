["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the position of the lower lip in Ricketts esthetic plane. I will review the provided documents to see if they provide any information about this topic. The first document 'Staircase' closure of lower lip defects does not specifically mention Ricketts esthetic plane. The second and third documents do not seem relevant to this question either. The fourth document 'Improving patient appearance' mentions adjunct maxillofacial soft tissue surgery, but it does not provide information about the position of the lower lip in Ricketts esthetic plane. Therefore, I will have to rely on general knowledge or other external sources to answer this question.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B: On the plane\"\n}"]
