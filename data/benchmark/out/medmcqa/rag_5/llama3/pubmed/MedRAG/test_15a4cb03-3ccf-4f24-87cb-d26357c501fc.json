["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the problem associated with wide divergent roots of primary teeth. Upon reviewing the provided documents, it can be seen that there are no specific references to this condition. However, one of the case reports mentions 'abnormal root development' and 'short roots' which could be related to this condition. Additionally, another document discusses 'physiological root resorption' but does not specifically mention wide divergent roots. Therefore, it can be inferred that the problem associated with wide divergent roots of primary teeth is not explicitly mentioned in any of the provided documents.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: None\"\n}"]
