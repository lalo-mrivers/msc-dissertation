["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the auditory pathway from peripheral to central. The cochlea is mentioned as a structure associated with the auditory pathway, but it's not explicitly stated as part of the central auditory system. Based on the information provided, we can infer that the sequence starts with the cochlea and proceeds to the cochlear nucleus. The inferior colliculus is also mentioned as being involved in extracting features of sound location. The medial geniculate body and auditory cortex are mentioned separately, but it's unclear which one comes after the others. We can make an educated guess based on the anatomy of the brain.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B\n}"]
