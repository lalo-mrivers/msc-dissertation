["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents suggest that the olfactory nerve is damaged most often after blunt head trauma. This means the other cranial nerves involved in olfaction are not included in this question. The trigeminal nerve, which is also involved in olfaction, is mentioned as being rarely affected.
