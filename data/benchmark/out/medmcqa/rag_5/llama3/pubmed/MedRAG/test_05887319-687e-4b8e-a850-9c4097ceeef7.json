["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about an intrauterine infection associated with limb reduction defects and scarring of skin. We have several documents to refer to, including 'Ocular pathology of the congenital varicella syndrome'. This document mentions congenital anomalies that include cicatrical skin lesions, atrophic limb, low birth weight, and chorioretinal scarring, all of which are related to limb reduction defects and scarring. Additionally, the document specifically mentions varicella-zoster virus contact in utero as a cause of these anomalies. Therefore, it is likely that Varicella virus is the intrauterine infection associated with limb reduction defects and scarring of skin.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
