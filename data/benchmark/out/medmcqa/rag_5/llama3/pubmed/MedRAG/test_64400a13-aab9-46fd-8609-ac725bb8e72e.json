["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to the documents provided, we know that serum creatinine does not accurately reflect changes in glomerular filtration rate (GFR). We also know that structural and functional adaptation after reduction of nephron population leads to remarkable compensatory increases in GFR. Additionally, antihypertensive therapy can help lower blood pressure, which is inversely associated with the progression of renal disease. Furthermore, simultaneous iothalamate, creatinine, and urea clearances show that at normal levels, creatinine clearance approximates GFR, but at reduced levels, it overestimates GFR. Lastly, normalisation of glomerular filtration rate measurements involves dividing by patient's surface area and multiplying by the surface area of a 'standard' man. Considering these points, we can conclude that all except one option is correct.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
