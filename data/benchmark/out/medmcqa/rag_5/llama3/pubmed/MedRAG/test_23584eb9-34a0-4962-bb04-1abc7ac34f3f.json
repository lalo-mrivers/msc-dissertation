["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the effect of a new drug combination on metastatic melanoma. The fact that it prolongs survival suggests that the treatment has improved patient outcomes. Considering the provided documents, we know that radiotherapy has been shown to be superior in slowly developing malignancies and immunotherapy has not proven curative but may have some beneficial effects, such as prolonging life or reducing recurrence. High-dose methotrexate has also shown some promise in advanced melanoma. Given this information, it's reasonable to assume that the new drug combination is likely a chemotherapy-based treatment with possible immunotherapeutic components. This would suggest that incidence (new cases) might remain the same, as the treatment is not addressing the underlying cause of the disease, but prevalence (existing cases) could increase as more patients survive longer due to the treatment's effectiveness.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
