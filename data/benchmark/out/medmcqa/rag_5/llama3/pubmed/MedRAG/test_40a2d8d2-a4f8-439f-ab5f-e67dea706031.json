["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the percentage of fluoride used in iontophoresis. We need to look for a relevant document that mentions iontophoresis and provides information about the amount of fluoride used. The second document 'Effect of topical applications of neutral sodium fluoride on dental careis in the rat.' mentions iontophoresis, but it doesn't provide specific information about the percentage of fluoride used. The third document 'The effectiveness of sodium fluoride iontophoresis in patients with sensitive teeth.' is more relevant as it talks about using a 2% sodium fluoride solution for iontophoresis. Therefore, we can conclude that the percentage of fluoride used in iontophoresis is 2%.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
