["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking which of the options show chemical bond with enamel (calcified tissues). The provided documents mention enamel as a crystalline formation with diverse range of properties. In 'Molecular mechanisms in dental hard tissue mineralization', it is mentioned that enamel is formed from a noncollagenous matrix (mostly amelogenin), which is almost completely removed and replaced with hydroxyapatite. Therefore, the key point to consider is what materials can bond chemically with hydroxyapatite, the main component of enamel. In 'Electroless and chemical metal deposition on human tooth enamel', it is mentioned that a thin metal film can be deposited onto tooth enamel using chemical solutions containing ions of the metal to be deposited and suitable reducing agent solutions. This suggests that certain metals can form chemical bonds with enamel. There is no information in the provided documents about composites, direct filling resins, polycarboxylate cements or BIS-GMA resins forming chemical bonds with enamel.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
