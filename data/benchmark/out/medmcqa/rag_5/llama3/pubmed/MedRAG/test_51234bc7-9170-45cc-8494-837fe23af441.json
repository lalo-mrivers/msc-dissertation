["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the best study design to compare the fat content in expressed breast milk of pre-term infants as compared to term infants. The studies provided earlier are focused on different aspects such as breastfeeding management, fatty acid composition of infant formulas, and influence of diet on food intake and growth of male infants. None of these studies seem directly relevant to the question at hand.\n\nHowever, we can learn from the 'Sucking on the 'emptied' breast: non-nutritive sucking with a difference' study that allowed for sucking on the expressed breast milk in low birthweight infants. This suggests that we may need to consider a design that allows for comparison of pre-term and term infant breast milk samples.\n\nAmong the options, Case control (A) seems most suitable as it would involve recruiting two groups of mothers, one with pre-term infants and another with term infants, and comparing their expressed breast milk fat content. This design would allow for a direct comparison between the two groups.\",\n\"answer_choice\": A"]
