["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the type of acid-base disturbance, we need to look at the pCO2, pO2, and pH values. First, let's look at the pCO2 value. A pCO2 value of 30 mm Hg is low, indicating respiratory alkalosis or respiratory acidosis. Next, let's consider the pO2 value. A pO2 value of 105 mm Hg is normal. Finally, let's examine the pH value. A pH value of 7.46 is slightly alkaline but still within the normal range. Considering all these values together, we can conclude that this patient has respiratory alkalosis.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
