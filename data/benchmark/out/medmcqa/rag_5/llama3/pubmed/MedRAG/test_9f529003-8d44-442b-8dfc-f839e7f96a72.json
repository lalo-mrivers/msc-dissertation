["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about preventing massive hemoptysis. There are no relevant documents discussing prevention of hemoptysis. However, we can look at the documents for related information on managing and treating hemoptysis. From 'Immediate operative treatment for massive hemoptysis', we see that immediate identification of the site of bleeding by bronchoscopy followed by thoracotomy with resection of the bleeding source is the preferred method of managing such patients, except when there are specific contraindications to resection. From 'Pulmonary varix', we see that patients without symptoms should have periodic chest radiographs. There's no mention of prevention of hemoptysis. Therefore, the answer must be something that is not a treatment or management option for hemoptysis.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
