["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Collagen is described as having a great tensile strength conferred by a rope-like structure and intermolecular crosslinks. This suggests that the strength of collagen is related to its structure and crosslinking. According to the provided documents, hydroxyproline is mentioned as one of the components of collagen, which is also known for providing some insights into certain diseases of connective tissue. It can be inferred that the presence of hydroxyproline contributes to the tensile strength of collagen.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
