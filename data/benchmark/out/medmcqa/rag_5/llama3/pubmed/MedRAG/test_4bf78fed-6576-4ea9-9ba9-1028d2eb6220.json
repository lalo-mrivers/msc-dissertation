["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about approaches for removing a vertebral disc. The provided documents discuss various surgical approaches for lumbar disc excision (A simplified surgical approach for lumbar disc excision and Intervertebral bone implants following excision of protruded lumbar discs) and thoracic disc herniation treatment (Thoracic disc herniation. Treatment and prognosis). Based on this information, the options provided are all surgical approaches that can be used to remove a vertebral disc.\n\nThe document 'Intervertebral bone implants following excision of protruded lumbar discs' discusses a technique where a portion of the lamina removed during exposure of an intervertebral lumbar disc protrusion is implanted in the intervertebral disc space following disc excision. This suggests that laminotomy (removal of a portion of the lamina) can be used to remove a vertebral disc.\n\nThe document 'A simplified surgical approach for lumbar disc excision' reviews the relevant surgical anatomy and discusses the indications and contraindications for a simple approach to the distal lumbar spine for disc excision. This suggests that laminectomy (removal of the lamina) can be used to remove a vertebral disc.\n\nThe document 'Thoracic disc herniation. Treatment and prognosis' describes the treatment of thoracic disc herniation, which includes using the transthoracic anterolateral approach. This does not suggest any specific surgical approach for removing a vertebral disc in the thoracic spine, but it does show that different approaches can be used to treat thoracic disc herniation.\n\nFinally, hemilaminectomy is a type of laminectomy where only one side of the lamina is removed. This suggests that hemilaminectomy can also be used to remove a vertebral disc.\n\nBased on this analysis, all of the provided options (A-D) can be used to remove a vertebral disc, and therefore none of them should be considered as an exception.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
