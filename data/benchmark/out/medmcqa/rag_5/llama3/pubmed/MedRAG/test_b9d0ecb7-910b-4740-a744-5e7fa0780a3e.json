["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's hemoglobin level is 14 g/dL. We are looking for the oxygen carrying capacity, which depends on the hemoglobin concentration. There is no information about the patient's condition or medical history that would affect their oxygen transport. Therefore, we can rely solely on the normal values provided in the documents. The document 'Oxygen transport in a woman with hemoglobin Hope/beta+ thalassemia' provides a reference range for hemoglobin level (14 +/- 2). Since our patient's hemoglobin level is within this range, we can use it as the normal value. The oxygen carrying capacity is proportional to the hemoglobin concentration.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
