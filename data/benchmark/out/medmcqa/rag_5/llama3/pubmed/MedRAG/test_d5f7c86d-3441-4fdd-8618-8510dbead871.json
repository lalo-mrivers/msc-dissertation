["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks for the maximum number of genes that code for receptors. Based on the provided documents, it can be seen that there are multiple mentions of receptors, including G-protein-coupled receptors and Fc gamma RI receptors. From these texts, it is clear that gene structure plays a crucial role in determining receptor function. The document on repeat sequences in the gene encoding the human D4 dopamine receptor highlights the importance of intron-exon structures in altering amino acid sequences. Similarly, the characterization of three genes for the human high affinity Fc gamma RI receptor shows that different exons can generate distinct transcripts. Based on this information, it is likely that multiple genes code for different types of receptors.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
