["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the most metabolically active layer in the bone. We can look at the provided documents to find the answer. Bone remodelling is a process where there is a balance between bone resorption and formation. The document on bone remodelling states that the osteoclasts and osteoblasts have evolved to regulate the growth and turnover of bone and mediate ion fluxes between the bone and blood. This suggests that the most metabolically active layer in the bone is likely to be where these cells are most active. Looking at the document on Morphological and functional interrelationships of bone cells and matrix, we can see that the cells which are functionally different act as coordinated units depending on a variety of signals which may be hormonal, ionic, mechanical and, possibly, electrical. This suggests that the most metabolically active layer in the bone is where these cells are interacting with each other.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
