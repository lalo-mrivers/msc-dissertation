["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the infective stage of Plasmodium vivax to mosquito. From the provided documents, we can see that Anopheles fluviatilis is a vector of malaria and its biological features are described. Additionally, another document explains that development of different strains of Plasmodium vivax in two species of Anopheles shows that oocyst infections had salivary gland infections at a higher rate. This suggests that the infective stage to mosquito is not directly related to the stages mentioned (C and D) because they are human blood stages or early parasite development stages, whereas mosquito infection requires further development.\n\nTherefore, considering the documents' information about Anopheles fluviatilis as vectors of malaria and Plasmodium vivax's life cycle, we can infer that the infective stage is likely to be one of the last stages in the parasite's life cycle. This would lead us to consider the options B or A.\n\nLooking at the documents again, we find that gametocytes are mentioned as being produced in a single major wave with maximal numbers between day 7 and day 16. However, in vivo infectivity to the mosquito is maximal at day 3-5 when gametocyte numbers are only 9% of the peak levels seen later.\n\nFurthermore, another document highlights that transmission-blocking vaccines represent a powerful approach to controlling the spread of malaria by blocking completely the transmission of these parasites. This suggests that the infective stage to mosquito could be related to the sexual stages of Plasmodium falciparum.\n\nConsidering this information, we can conclude that the most likely answer is A: Sporozoite.\", \n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
