["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the zone of stimulation. From the provided documents, we know that magnetic stimulation can stimulate neurons in the CNS (Central Nervous System) as well as peripheral nerves like the median nerve and ulnar nerve. The location of depolarization on the coil corresponds to the area over and parallel to the median nerve when using a 9-cm diameter coil. Therefore, it is likely that the zone of stimulation contains neurons.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
