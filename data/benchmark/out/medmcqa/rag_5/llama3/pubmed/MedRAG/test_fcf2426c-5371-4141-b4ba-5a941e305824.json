["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about relative bradycardia, which is a type of bradycardia that occurs in specific situations. In the provided documents, there are several instances where bradycardia is discussed as an abnormal reaction to certain conditions. The key to answering this question is to identify what these conditions have in common. From reviewing the documents, we can see that bradycardia is associated with vagal- or acetylcholine-mediated reactions, postural changes, and fetal head compression. These situations all have one thing in common: they are not related to infections such as Brucellosis, Typhoid, or Malaria. Therefore, the answer must be a condition that is not an infection.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
