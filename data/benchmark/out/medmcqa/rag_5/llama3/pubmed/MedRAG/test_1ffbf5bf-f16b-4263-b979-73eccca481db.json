["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"We are looking for the incidence of 2 canals in mandibular premolars. None of the provided documents specifically mention mandibular incisors. However, we can look at the information on mandibular premolars. According to Root canal morphology of mandibular premolars, the mandibular second premolar had one canal at the apex in 97.5% and two canals at the apex in 2.5% of the teeth. This suggests that the incidence of 2 canals in mandibular second premolars is around 2.5%. We don't have direct information on mandibular first premolars, but we know that they had a higher percentage of multiple roots and canals (25.5%). Therefore, it's reasonable to assume that the incidence of 2 canals in mandibular first premolars is also likely to be above 20%. Since we are looking for the incidence of 2 canals in mandibular incisors, which is not directly mentioned in any of the documents, we need to make an educated guess based on the information available.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
