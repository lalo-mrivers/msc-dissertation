["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about a material that turns to liquid on applying critical shear stress. None of the provided options (A: Newtonian body, B: Bingham body, C: Dilatant, D: Pseudoplastic) describe this behavior. The text Conditions of flow at interfaces with flexible walls discusses surface waves and fluid zones, but it doesn't mention a material turning to liquid on applying shear stress. The interpretation of partial plug flow of concentrated suspensions discusses particle interaction and core diameter to particle size and concentration, but it's not relevant to the question either. The Influence of substratum wettability on the strength of adhesion of human fibroblasts doesn't mention anything about materials or critical shear stresses. Vascular endothelium responds to fluid shear stress gradients talks about flow separation and reattachment, but again, no mention of materials turning to liquid. Longitudinal tension variation in collapsible channels: a new mechanism for the breakdown of steady flow discusses tube wall tension and viscous shear stress, but it's not relevant either. Therefore, we can conclude that none of the provided options are correct.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"None of the above\""]
