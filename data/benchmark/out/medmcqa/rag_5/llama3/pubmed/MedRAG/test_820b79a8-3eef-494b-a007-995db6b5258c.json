["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the provided documents, we can see that both amide- and ester-linked local anesthetics (LAs) exhibit a differential effect on B and C fibers. The first document states that the concentration of prilocaine (amide-linked secondary amine) required to reduce the B fibre compound action potential by 50% was one-third of the concentration required to depress the C fibre potential to a similar extent. Additionally, both local anaesthetic agents showed the action potential propagation through B fibres more than through C fibres. This suggests that B fibers are less susceptible to LA blockade compared to C fibers. Furthermore, the second document discusses the clinical character of LAs and how they differentially affect motor and sensory nerves. It is concluded that local anesthetics which have a minimal effect on the refractory period yield enhanced motor block; whereas local anesthetics with a large effect on the refractory period are relatively more potent blockers of sensory and sympathetic transmission. This also supports the idea that B fibers are less susceptible to LA blockade compared to C fibers. Finally, the fourth document discusses the physiological properties of adjacent innervated skeletal muscle fibers in response to denervation. It is concluded that denervated fibers do not induce substantial physiological changes in adjacent innervated muscle fibers. This finding does not directly relate to the question but provides additional information on nerve fiber types and their susceptibility to LA blockade.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D\n}"]
