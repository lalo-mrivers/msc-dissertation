["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the ability of streptococci to adhere to tooth surfaces and contribute to caries development. From the given documents, it can be seen that glucans synthesized in situ in experimental salivary pellicle function as specific binding sites for Streptococcus mutans. This suggests that streptococci can adhere to tooth surfaces by recognizing salivary binding sites and also by binding to glucans synthesized in situ. Therefore, the correct answer is option C: Produce extracellular polysachharides.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
