["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks if it's possible to remove centric interference and working interference by reducing supporting cusps in natural dentition. From the provided documents, we can see that occlusal adjustments are mentioned as a technique for removing interferences and establishing smooth jaw movements. In the 'An instrumented technique for occlusal adjustment' document, it is suggested that the dentist identify and remove occlusal interferences. This implies that reducing supporting cusps could be one way to achieve this. Additionally, in the 'Working cast verification' document, correlation of clinical recordings with articulated working casts allows for elimination of most occlusal adjustments required when the restoration is seated in the mouth. This also suggests that modifying the natural dentition, including reducing supporting cusps, can help remove interferences.\",\n\"answer_choice\": A"]
