["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents discuss the prevention of Rh haemolytic disease and the administration of anti-D immunoglobulin. The documents mention that administering anti-D after all Rh-negative deliveries and abortions can reduce the incidence of severely affected Rh babies. There is no specific mention of timing during pregnancy, so we need to look at other options. One document mentions repeated antigenic stimuli at individual intervals of 2-9 months, which suggests that repeated doses are possible without harm. Another document discusses the failure of anti-D immunoglobulin to remove fetal red cells from maternal circulation and a diminished reaction with a batch of anti-D immunoglobulin used, suggesting that there may be cases where anti-D is not effective immediately. Therefore, the best time to give anti-D may not be during pregnancy, but rather after delivery or abortion.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: After delivery\"\n}"]
