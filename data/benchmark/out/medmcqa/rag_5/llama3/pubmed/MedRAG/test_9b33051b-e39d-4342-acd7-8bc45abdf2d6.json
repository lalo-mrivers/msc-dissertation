["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about a person with eonism, which is a type of fetishism. The papers provided discuss various psychological and sexual topics, but none of them directly address eonism. However, we can rule out options D (seeing the opposite paner nude) and B (Fondling female body pas) as they are not related to cross-dressing or genital contact, which are key aspects of eonism. Option C (Rubbing genitalia against body of other person) is also unlikely as it focuses on sexual activity rather than dressing. Therefore, the most plausible option is A: Wearing clothes of opposite sex.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
