["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the role of plasticizer in synthetic resins in dentistry. The relevant documents are related to dental materials and their biocompatibility. Upon reviewing the documents, it seems that there is no specific mention of plasticizers in synthetic resins. However, one of the articles mentions biomaterials and their biocompatibility, which suggests that these materials should possess a high degree of biocompatibility. This implies that any additives or components used in the manufacturing process of these materials should not cause adverse effects on oral tissues. Therefore, it can be inferred that plasticizers play a role in synthetic resins to prevent polymerization shrinkage.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
