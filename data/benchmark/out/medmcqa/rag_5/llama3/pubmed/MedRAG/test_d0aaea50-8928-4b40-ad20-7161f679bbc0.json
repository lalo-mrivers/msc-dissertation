["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents suggest that muscles involved in opening of the jaw are mentioned. The masseter muscle is recruited during hypercapnia and loading (Respiratory-related recruitment of the masseter: response to hypercapnia and loading), which suggests it may be involved in closing, not opening. However, the digastric muscle is specifically mentioned as being recorded simultaneously with force developed at the chin during static and dynamic conditions of opening (Electromyographic activity in digastric muscles and opening force of mandible during static and dynamic conditions). This suggests that the digastric muscle may be involved in opening the jaw. Additionally, the masseter muscle is not typically associated with opening the jaw.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
