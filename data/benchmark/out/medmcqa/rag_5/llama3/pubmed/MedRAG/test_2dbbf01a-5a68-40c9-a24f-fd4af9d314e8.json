["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the criteria for considering a high endemic area for meningococcal meningitis. After reviewing the provided documents, I did not find any specific information on the WHO definition of a high endemic area for meningococcal meningitis. However, the document 'Detection of meningitis epidemics in Africa: a population-based analysis' mentions that a threshold of 15 cases/100,000/week averaged over 2 weeks was 72-93% sensitive and 92-100% specific in detecting epidemics exceeding 100 cases/100,000/year. This information is related to the detection of meningitis epidemics, not specifically the criteria for considering a high endemic area.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
