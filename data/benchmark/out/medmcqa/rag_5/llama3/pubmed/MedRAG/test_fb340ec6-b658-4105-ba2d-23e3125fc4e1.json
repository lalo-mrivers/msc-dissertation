["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking what factor does NOT affect the resolving power of a microscope. The provided documents discuss various aspects of microscopy, including electron microscopy and optical microscopy. The resolving power of an optical microscope depends on factors such as aperture size (which affects diffraction limit), wavelength of light source used (which affects resolution), and other parameters like focal length of the eyepiece or thickness of the film. In contrast, the provided documents on electron microscopy do not mention these specific factors as affecting the resolving power.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
