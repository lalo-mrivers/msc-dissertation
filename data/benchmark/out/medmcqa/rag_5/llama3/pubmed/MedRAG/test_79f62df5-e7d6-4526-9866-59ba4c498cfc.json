["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the smallest cusp of Mandibular 1st molar. Since there is no mention of specific studies or populations, I will rely on general dental knowledge and the provided documents. The provided documents describe dental morphology and anatomy, but none of them specifically discuss the Mandibular 1st molar's smallest cusp. However, we can look at the descriptions of mandibular molars in the second document. It describes a hierarchy of primary and permanent mandibular molar cusps, including five-cusped molars with a distal fovea and distal marginal ridge (5fd), five-cusped molars without a distal fovea and without a distal marginal ridge (5o), and four-cusped molars (4c). The smallest cusp is not explicitly mentioned, but it can be inferred that the distal cusps are likely to be smaller than the mesial and buccal cusps. Therefore, based on general dental knowledge and the provided documents, I would infer that the smallest cusp of Mandibular 1st molar is likely to be one of the distal cusps.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
