["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the strength of a gypsum investment. The relevant documents provided are about the setting and thermal expansion of investments, mould-reaction with gypsum bonded refractory investments, improvement in the properties of gypsum casts by polymer impregnation, and some economic and technical factors affecting use of phosphate raw materials. None of these documents mention carbon content, silica content, or copper as a factor that affects the strength of a gypsum investment. One document discusses the addition of modifiers to increase thermal expansion, which may affect the strength of an investment in certain contexts. Another document describes how polymer impregnation can strengthen gypsum casts. Therefore, it is likely that the correct answer is related to the chemical composition or treatment of the gypsum.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
