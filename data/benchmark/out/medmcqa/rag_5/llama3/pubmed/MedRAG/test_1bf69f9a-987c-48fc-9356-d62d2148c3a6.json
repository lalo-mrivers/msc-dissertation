["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"There is no specific documentation that suggests a time limit for suctioning tracheal secretions. However, one document mentions the importance of gentle suction to avoid mucosal trauma (Comparison of tracheobronchial suction catheters in humans). Another document highlights the risks associated with tracheobronchial suctioning and emphasizes the need for skilled nurses to prevent or minimize complications (Potential hazards of tracheobronchial suctioning). Therefore, it is likely that the optimal time for suctioning would depend on individual patient factors and the suction technique used. There are no specific guidelines provided in the given documents regarding the optimal suctioning duration.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
