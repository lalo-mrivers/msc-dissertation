["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the placement of an indirect retainer. The documents provided are related to removable partial dentures, bridges, and retainers. Since there is no specific mention of indirect retainers in the first two documents, we need to look at the last three documents which discuss various types of retainers. Based on these documents, it seems that indirect retainers can be placed in different locations depending on the type of restoration being used. In some cases, they are placed near direct retainers (e.g., proximal surface guiding planes), while in others they may be placed farther away from fulcrum lines or even at the edentulous area. Since there is no specific mention of the placement of indirect retainers in terms of fulcrum lines or edentulous areas, we can eliminate options D and C. Option A mentions a location that is relevant to direct retainer, but it's not directly related to the placement of an indirect retainer.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
