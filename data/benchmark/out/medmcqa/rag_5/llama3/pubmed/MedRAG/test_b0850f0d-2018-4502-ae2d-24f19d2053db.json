["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about deep gingival sheath preparation. After reviewing the provided documents, I found that none of them explicitly discuss the shape of a wedge for deep gingival sheath preparation. However, I noticed that one document ('Exposure of subgingival margins by nonsurgical gingival displacement') mentions the use of three cords to displace the gum tissue prior to subgingival tooth preparation. This suggests that some sort of shaping or displacement may be necessary to access the subgingival area. Given this information, I can infer that the wedge shape required for deep gingival sheath preparation would likely need to be able to effectively displace or reshape the gum tissue. None of the provided documents explicitly mention a specific shape (round, triangular, square) being recommended.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
