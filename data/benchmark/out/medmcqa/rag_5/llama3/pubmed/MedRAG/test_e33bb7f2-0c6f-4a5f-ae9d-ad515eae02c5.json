["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents mention the physical characteristics of high-energy radiations, such as megavoltage photons and electrons. There is no mention of density or materials properties like strength, melting temperature, or weight. The context suggests radiation therapy and medical imaging, rather than material science or engineering. Therefore, we need to look for a connection between density and energy.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
