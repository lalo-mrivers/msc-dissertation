["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about standardization, but the provided documents seem to be related to reference materials and methods, normal values, reference intervals, analytical goals, and medical observations. However, upon closer reading, I found that the concept of standardization is not directly mentioned in these documents. Instead, they focus on establishing reference points for analytical measurements, comparing methods and results between different laboratories, and developing criteria for evaluating test performance.\n\nIn this context, the statements provided as options do not seem to be directly related to the concepts discussed in the given documents. However, if I had to make an educated guess based on the information provided, I would say that option B (The national population is always taken as the standard population) might not be entirely accurate, as the concept of a 'national population' is not mentioned in the provided texts.\n\nTherefore, I will choose option B as my answer.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
