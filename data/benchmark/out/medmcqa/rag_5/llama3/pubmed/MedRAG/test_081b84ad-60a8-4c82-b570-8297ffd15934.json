["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"After reviewing the provided documents, I searched for terms related to endodontics. Since the question is asking about the glossary of terms according to the American Association of Endodontics, I looked for relevant information in the 'Oral manifestations of HIV infection' document, which mentions endodontic-related terms. However, this document does not seem to provide a comprehensive glossary of endodontic terms. Next, I checked the 'The diagnostic correlator: an endodontic teaching device' paper, which also discusses endodontics but does not appear to include a glossary.
