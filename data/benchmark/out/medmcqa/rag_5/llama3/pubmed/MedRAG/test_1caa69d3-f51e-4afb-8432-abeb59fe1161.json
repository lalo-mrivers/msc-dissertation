["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the use of hypertonic solutions in various situations. Study of plasma osmolarity during the treatment of diabetic ketoacidoses mentions predominantly hypernatremic hyperosmolarity (5.9% of cases) and recommends weak alkaline hypotonic electrolytic solutions. Short term volume effects of a hypertonic saline bolus during neurosurgery show an initial intravascular volume expansion followed by a decrease, suggesting potential advantages for treatment of intracranial hypertension. Fluid dynamics in cerebral angiography provide information on the mechanical effects of rapid intravascular injection of a highly ionized hypertonic solution. Adverse reactions to intrathecal saline injection for control of pain report an adverse temporary symptom or sign in nearly 11% of patients and significant morbidity in slightly over 1%. Osmotic challenges in the assessment of bronchial hyperresponsiveness describe the use of nonisotonic aerosols, including hypertonic solutions, to document bronchial hyperresponsiveness. Based on these studies, hypertonic solutions are used for treatment of diabetic ketoacidoses, intracranial hypertension, pain control, and airway narrowing assessment.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
