["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the most common cause of recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy. From the provided documents, we can see that one of them discusses the causes of postoperative aspiration following conservation surgery of the larynx (New insights into the causes of postoperative aspiration following conservation surgery of the larynx). This study recognizes and delineates the part played by paralysis of the superior and recurrent laryngeal nerves as causes for aspiration. In another document, we can see that recurrent nerve palsy is discussed in relation to endotracheal intubation (Recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy and endotracheal intubation). The documents suggest possible causes of paralysis such as thyroid surgery and mediastinal tumors. Therefore, it seems likely that thyroid surgery could be a common cause of recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
