["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about problems associated with nitrous oxide anaesthesia. From the provided documents, we know that nitrous oxide can cause airway related problems when used during inhalation induction of anaesthesia with isoflurane and nitrous oxide in oxygen (Document 1). We also know that addition of carbon dioxide resulted in more rapid induction and significantly reduced the incidence and severity of airway related problems. Additionally, we find that nitrous oxide can be hazardous for organ dysfunction in chronically exposed man (Document 4) and that concerns exist about the effects of occupational exposure to nitrous oxide (Document 5). Therefore, based on these findings, the correct answer is C: Prolonged difficult induction.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
