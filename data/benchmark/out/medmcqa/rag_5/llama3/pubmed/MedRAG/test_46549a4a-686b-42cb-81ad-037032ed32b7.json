["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"There are no relevant documents that specifically mention high Cu alloys. However, the provided documents focus on different topics such as precipitation hardening, corrosion resistance, and characterization of various materials. Since there is no information about high Cu alloys, we cannot determine their properties or characteristics. The question asks about exceptions for High Cu alloys, so we can only choose an option that does not provide any relevant information.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: None of the above\"\n}"]
