["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Metformin is a biguanide antidiabetic medication that works by reducing glucose production in the liver. It also increases insulin sensitivity, making it easier for glucose to enter cells.

The statement about reducing hepatic glucose production aligns with the mechanism of action of metformin.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
