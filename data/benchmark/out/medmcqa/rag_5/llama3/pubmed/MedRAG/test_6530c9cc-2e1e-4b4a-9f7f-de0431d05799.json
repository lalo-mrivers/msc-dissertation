["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about cell junctions that allow exchange of cytoplasmic molecules between two cells. According to the provided documents, tight junctions (TJ) form an intercellular barrier between epithelial cells and liver cells, which separates tissue compartments. TJ also forms an intramembrane barrier between apical and basolateral membrane domains, contributing to segregation of biochemically distinct components. However, TJ do not allow exchange of cytoplasmic molecules between two cells.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
