["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about a gene commonly indicated in congenital cataract. The given documents describe several types of hereditary cataracts, including autosomal dominant forms and translocations that affect the development of the eye. While these documents do not explicitly mention any specific genes associated with congenital cataract, they do provide information on linkage analysis and genetic transmission patterns.\n\nAfter reviewing the provided documents, it appears that none of the given options (A-D) are directly mentioned as being commonly indicated in congenital cataract. However, we can infer from the documents that the question is likely asking about a gene related to eye development or inheritance patterns.\n\nGiven the information provided, we cannot determine a specific answer with certainty. Therefore, our thinking process stops here.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"None of the above\""]
