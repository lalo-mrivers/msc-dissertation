["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the age of preoperational stage. Upon reviewing the relevant documents, I found that there is no mention of a 'preoperational stage' with specific ages mentioned. However, one of the documents mentions 'neonatal surgery', which suggests that the first few weeks or months of life are included in this category. This could be related to the preoperational stage, but without further information, it's difficult to pinpoint an exact age range. Therefore, I will rely on general knowledge and answer based on Piaget's theory of cognitive development, which proposes that the preoperational stage occurs between 2-7 years.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
