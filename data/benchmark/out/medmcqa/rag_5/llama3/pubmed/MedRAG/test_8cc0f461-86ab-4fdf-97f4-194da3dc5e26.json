["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the provided documents, it is clear that Meissner's corpuscles are found in the mucocutaneous end organ. This end organ is described as being divided into sublobular units comprising axon terminals surrounded by generally concentric lamellar processes which are derived from laminar cells whose nuclei are situated towards the periphery of the sublobules. The ultrastructural features of this end organ are similar to that of the Meissner corpuscle, supporting the view that differences in sensory end organs are merely variations on a common organizational basis. Therefore, it can be concluded that Meissner's corpuscles are located within the mucocutaneous end organ.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
