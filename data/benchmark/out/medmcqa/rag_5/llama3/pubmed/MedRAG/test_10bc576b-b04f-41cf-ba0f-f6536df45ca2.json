["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents mention the evaluation of essential oils for their ability to dissolve gutta-percha. According to one document, chloroform and rectified turpentine oil are the only two essential oils that dissolved gutta-percha completely. This suggests that these two solvents may be effective in dissolving gutta-percha. However, another document discusses the relationship between solubility and partial pressure, which does not directly apply to this question. The other documents do not provide relevant information about gutta-percha dissolution. Therefore, based on the available information, chloroform is likely the safest and most efficacious solvent for dissolving gutta-percha.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
