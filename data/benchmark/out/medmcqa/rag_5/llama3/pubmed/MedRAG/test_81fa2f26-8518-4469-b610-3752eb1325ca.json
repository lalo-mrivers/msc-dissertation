["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"During cobalt chromium crown reconstruction, when the temperature of soldering torch suddenly increases, it is likely that the material properties are affected. Cobalt-chromium alloys are strengthened by precipitation hardening (as described in one of the provided documents). When the alloy is heated, the precipitates dissolve and the yield strength decreases while percent elongation increases. This suggests that option A: Yield strength decreases and percent elongation increases would be a more likely outcome.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
