["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Mantle cell lymphoma is characterized by the t(11;14) (q13;q32) translocation and its molecular counterpart bcl-1 rearrangement. This information is provided in the first document, 'Mantle cell lymphoma: an update'. There is no mention of CD 5, CD 10, CD 23, or CD 25 in this document. Therefore, we must look to other sources for information on these specific proteins. The second document provides a general overview of non-Hodgkin's lymphomas and does not provide any specific information on Mantle cell Carcinoma. The third and fourth documents deal with different topics, transformation of nodular lymphoma and common non-pigmented skin cancer respectively. Therefore, we must look to other sources or studies for information on the expression of these proteins in Mantle cell Carcinoma.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: CD 5+, CD 23-\""]
