["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the management of facial trauma, including maxillofacial injuries. The key consideration is to ensure patency of the airway and circulation. In cases of panfacial trauma, it is likely that the patient has a high probability of associated serious injuries of the central nervous system, the trunk, or the extremities (Review of 1,000 major facial fractures and associated injuries). This suggests that the patient should be primarily under the care of a surgeon who can diagnose and treat these associated injuries. The primary treatment of frontobasal and midfacial fractures in patients with head injuries emphasizes the need for close cooperation between surgical specialties and highlights the importance of early surgery (The primary treatment of frontobasil and midfacial fractures in patients with head injuries). This information suggests that the treatment should start from a level that allows for stabilization of the patient's airway, circulation, and potential neurological injuries. Based on this analysis, it is likely that the treatment should start at the NOE (nasofrontal ethmoid) and frontal bar level.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
