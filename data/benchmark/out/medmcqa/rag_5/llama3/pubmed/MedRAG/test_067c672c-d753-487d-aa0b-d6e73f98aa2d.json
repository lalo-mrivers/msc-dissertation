["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents provide information on coronary risk factors. The first document discusses the correlation of risk factors with arteriographically documented severity of atherosclerosis. It mentions seven easily measured risk factors that can identify high-risk patients. The second document compares the accuracy of numerical coronary profile in 1986 and 1990, highlighting increased attention to risk factor management over time. The third document studies family history as an independent risk factor for coronary artery disease. The fourth document discusses the pathophysiology of coronary artery disease, emphasizing the role of risk factors and behaviors. Finally, the fifth document provides a comprehensive overview on the prevention of coronary heart disease. Based on these documents, we can identify the risk factors mentioned. Smoking is explicitly listed as a risk factor in the first document. Hypertension is also mentioned in the second document, with increased attention to its management over time.
