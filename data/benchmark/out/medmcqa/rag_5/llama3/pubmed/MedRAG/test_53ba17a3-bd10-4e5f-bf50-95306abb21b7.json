["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about a child transferring objects from one hand to the other. This task requires an understanding of right-left relations and possibly involves interhemispheric transfer of information. The relevant documents suggest that young children have difficulty with crossed localization tasks, which involve using the unstimulated hand to localize stimulated fingers on the unstimulated hand. However, as children develop, their performance on these tasks improves. This suggests that the child's ability to transfer objects from one hand to the other may be related to their understanding of right-left relations and interhemispheric transfer.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
