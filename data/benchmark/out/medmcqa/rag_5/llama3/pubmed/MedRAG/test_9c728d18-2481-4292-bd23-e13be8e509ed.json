["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the total number of vertebrae present in the vertebral column. We can find this information by reviewing the anatomy texts. In the 'Contribution to the clinical anatomy of the vertebral column' document, it states that there are 5 types of vertebral units (cervical, thoracic, lumbar, sacral, and coccygeal). Each type has a specific number of vertebrae. For example, the cervical spine has 7 vertebrae, the thoracic spine has 12 vertebrae, the lumbar spine has 5 vertebrae, the sacrum has 5 fused vertebrae, and the coccyx has 4 fused vertebrae. Adding these numbers together gives us the total number of vertebrae present in the vertebral column.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
