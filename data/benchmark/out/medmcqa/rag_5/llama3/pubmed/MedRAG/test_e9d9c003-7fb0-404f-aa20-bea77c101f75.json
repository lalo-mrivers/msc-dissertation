["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question describes a child with repeated vomiting who developed metabolic alkalosis. The papers mention different forms of acidosis, such as proximal renal tubular acidosis and organic acidosis. Metabolic alkalosis is typically treated by correcting the underlying cause. In this case, since there's no indication of bone disease or failure to thrive, it's unlikely that the child has proximal renal tubular acidosis. Organic acidosis could be a possibility, but the papers don't provide specific guidance on treating metabolic alkalosis in this condition. Bicarbonate excretion is impaired in kwashiorkor, which may result in systemic alkalosis. However, since the treatment given doesn't involve bicarbonate administration, it's unlikely that the child has kwashiorkor. Considering the options, Ringer lactate and I.V. normal saline are more commonly used to treat metabolic alkalosis than ORS or I.V. normal saline with potassium.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
