["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The provided documents describe the properties of periodontal ligament under different conditions. We know that periodontal ligament behaves elastically up to a certain limit after which it ruptures (In vitro strength of the human periodontal ligament). In experimental periodontitis, the mechanical strength of the periodontal ligament decreased significantly due to alveolar bone loss and destruction of periodontal tissues at the cervical region (Effects of destructive periodontitis...). Craniomaxillary orthopedic correction with en masse dental control also puts pressure on the periodontal ligament. Therefore, heavy forces on periodontal ligament can cause a decrease in its mechanical strength.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
