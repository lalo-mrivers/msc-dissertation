["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"After reviewing the provided documents, we can identify that Acetyl-CoA is a substrate for citrate synthase, as mentioned in 'Catalytic strategy of citrate synthase: effects of amino acid changes in the acetyl-CoA binding site on transition-state analog inhibitor complexes.' This suggests that Acetyl-CoA is not a substrate for all enzymes. We can then analyze each option to determine which enzyme does not use Acetyl-CoA as a substrate.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
