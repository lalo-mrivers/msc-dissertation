["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to the relevant documents, infants are recommended to receive vaccines at different ages. For example, pertussis vaccination is recommended before age 10. In addition, the document 'Estimating the chance of an inadequately immunised child getting pertussis' suggests that inadequately immunized one-year-old children probably have more than a one in six chance of developing pertussis before age ten. Therefore, it is likely that the recommended vaccination schedule includes pertussis vaccine at 12-14 months. Furthermore, 'Current status of pediatric vaccines' mentions that pediatric immunization schedules have become more complex and include new vaccines for Haemophilus influenzae type b and measles. Based on this information, I would recommend following the latest vaccination schedule for a 13-month-old child.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
