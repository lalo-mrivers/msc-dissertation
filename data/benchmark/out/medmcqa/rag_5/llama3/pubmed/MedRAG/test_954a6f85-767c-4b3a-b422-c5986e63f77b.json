["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about excessive occlusal forces that can be superimposed. According to the document 'Occlusal force pattern during rhythmic human tapping movement', it states that there are two components of the triphasic pattern, and the first component is relatively stable regardless of changes in tapping frequency. This suggests that excessive occlusal forces may not be affected by certain factors. The document 'Vertical control: a multifactorial problem and its clinical implications' discusses vertical control in orthodontic cases and how it can affect the application of proper directional forces. It highlights that even with favorable growth potential, improper treatment procedures can have undesirable effects. This implies that excessive occlusal forces can be superimposed in certain situations. The document 'Osteochondroma of the mandibular condyle' discusses osteochondromas of the temporomandibular joint and how they require orthodontic treatment to correct compensatory occlusal adjustments. This suggests that excessive occlusal forces may be present in cases where there is a need for orthodontic treatment. Therefore, it can be inferred that excessive occlusal forces can be superimposed in all cases except those with normal periodontium and bone height.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
