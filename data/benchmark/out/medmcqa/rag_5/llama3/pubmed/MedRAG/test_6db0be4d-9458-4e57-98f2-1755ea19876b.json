["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the approved dose of misoprostol in emergent management of postpartum hemorrhage. Since there are no documents related to misoprostol or postpartum hemorrhage, we need to look for information that might be relevant to the question. We have several documents about prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), which is a different medication than misoprostol.
