["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the properties and characteristics of various composites and cements, including metal-filled resin composites and glass-ionomer cements with and without metal additions. From these documents, it can be inferred that the addition of metal to glass-ionomer cements can increase the strength of the materials. This information suggests that the advantage of glass ionomer cement reinforced with metal particles is increased strength.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
