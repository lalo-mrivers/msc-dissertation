["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the type of failure that may occur when the coefficient of thermal expansion of ceramic is much lower than that of metal. This scenario suggests that the ceramic and metal will expand at different rates with temperature changes, leading to stresses between them. Based on this information, we can infer that the metal will be trying to move away from the ceramic due to its higher thermal expansion. This could lead to a type of failure where the bond between the ceramic and metal breaks down, which is an adhesive failure. Therefore, the correct answer is B: Adhesive failure of metal ceramic bond.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
