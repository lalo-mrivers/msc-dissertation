["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the provided documents, we know that Golgi tendon organs are located within the spaces between braids of collagen. The mechanical events proposed to occur within the GTO appear to explain how it may function as a biological force transducer under static loading conditions. Additionally, we see in the 'Physiological properties of primary sensory neurons' document that stretch-sensitive afferents can be divided into in-parallel or in-series receptors (presumed muscle spindles and Golgi tendon organs, respectively). The majority of these fibers respond to ramp-and-hold stretches or direct muscle probing. This suggests that Golgi tendon organs detect changes in muscle tension.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
