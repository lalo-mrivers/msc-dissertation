["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the structures present on the floor of the third ventricle. The relevant documents are anatomical descriptions of various protein and viral structures, as well as papers discussing spatial structural knowledge and mathematical descriptions of structures. None of these documents specifically mention the floor of the third ventricle or its contents. Therefore, we need to rely on general anatomical knowledge. A quick search reveals that the optic stalk, third nerve, and mammillary body are all found in the brain, but not necessarily on the floor of the third ventricle.
