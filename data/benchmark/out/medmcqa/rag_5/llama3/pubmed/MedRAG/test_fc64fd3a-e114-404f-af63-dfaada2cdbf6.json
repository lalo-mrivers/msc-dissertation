["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The course of the peripheral gustatory nerves is discussed. Recent investigations lead to the conclusion that there is only one path for the gustatory fibers for each gustatory area: 1) from the anterior part of the tongue via the tympanic cord and facial nerve to the medulla oblongata; 2) for the posterior part of the tongue in the IX cranial nerve; and 3) from the soft palate via the greater superficial petrosal nerve to the facial nerve.
