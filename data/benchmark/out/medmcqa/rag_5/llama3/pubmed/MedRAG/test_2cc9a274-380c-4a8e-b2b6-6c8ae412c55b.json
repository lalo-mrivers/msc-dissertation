["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the ideal instrument to widen a canal. The provided documents mention different techniques and methods for endodontic therapy, but none of them specifically recommend an instrument for widening canals. However, one document mentions that 'the stepback enlargement technique is probably the best technique for enlarging finely curved canals', implying that files or reamers might be suitable instruments for this purpose. Another document describes the use of graduated instruments to measure root canal length, which suggests that these instruments may also be used for widening canals. Overall, it seems likely that a file or reamer would be suitable for widening canals.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
