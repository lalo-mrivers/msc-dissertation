["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about a currently used 'step back technique' that was modified. Looking at the provided documents, I see that there is no mention of 'step back technique' or 'Clam', 'Wein', 'Schilder', or 'Mullaney'. However, one document mentions 'osteotomy', which suggests a surgical procedure. The 'modified sagittal step osteotomy of the mandibular body' caught my attention as it seems to be related to the requested information. The document discusses an osteotomy technique for elongation and rotation of the anterior part of the mandible without the need for bone grafting, with reduced risk of damage to the alveolar nerve and increased stability.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
