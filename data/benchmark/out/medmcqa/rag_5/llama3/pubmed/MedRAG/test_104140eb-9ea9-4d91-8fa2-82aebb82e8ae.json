["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant document is 'Grids or air gaps for scatter reduction in digital radiography: a model calculation'. The text suggests that grids can have an effect on the signal-to-noise (SNR) improvement factor, which is a performance indicator. Specifically, additive system noise reduces the SNR improvement factor compared to the case with quantum noise only, and this reduction is more pronounced for grids than for air gaps.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
