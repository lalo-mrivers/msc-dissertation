["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking which pulp horn of primary molar is commonly exposed during restorative procedures. Primary incisors are mentioned in the document 'Histopathology of the pulp in primary incisors with deep dentinal caries', but it doesn't provide information about pulp horns in molars. Therefore, we need to look for information related to pulp horns in primary molars or secondary molars. The document 'Lesions resembling caries in unerupted teeth' mentions lesions resembling caries in the coronal portion of unerupted mandibular second permanent molars. Since these are not primary molars, we can't find any relevant information about pulp horns in this document. The other documents ('Histopathology of the pulp in primary incisors with deep dentinal caries', 'Microscopic study of the pulps of human teeth following vital root resection', 'A study of temperature changes during removal of amalgam restorations', and 'Thermally induced pulpalgia in endodontically treated teeth') don't provide information about pulp horns either. Therefore, we have to rely on general knowledge or anatomy texts to answer this question.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
