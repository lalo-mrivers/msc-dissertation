["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is presented with high blood pressure (160/100 mmHg) and tachycardia (120/min). The CECT shows no information about the cardiac status. Based on the documents, it seems that the patient's age (50 years old) is a relevant factor in determining the management of his condition. The documents suggest that patients over 65 years old with isolated systolic hypertension should be treated more aggressively. However, this patient is under 65 years old and has diastolic hypertension, which is not explicitly mentioned as a priority for treatment. Nevertheless, considering the high blood pressure and tachycardia, some form of treatment seems necessary.\n\nThe documents suggest that patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors or evidence of end-organ damage should be treated more aggressively. Since the patient's age, blood pressure, and heart rate are not normal, it can be inferred that he has multiple cardiovascular risk factors.\n\nBased on this information, it is likely that beta blockers would be a suitable choice for management, as they are commonly used to treat hypertension and may help control the patient's tachycardia.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
