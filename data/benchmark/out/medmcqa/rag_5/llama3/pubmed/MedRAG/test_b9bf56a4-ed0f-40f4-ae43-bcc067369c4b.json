["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Permanent bending of an orthodontic wire during its clinical application will lead to work hardening of the alloy. Work hardening is a process where the metal becomes stronger due to plastic deformation. This is similar to what happens when a metal is hammered or rolled into shape, causing it to become more rigid and less prone to deformation. Therefore, the correct answer would be an increase in strength.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
