["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents discuss various aspects of infective endocarditis, including diagnosis, treatment, and microbiology. The document 'Bacteriological aspects in the diagnosis and treatment of endocarditis (author's transl)' mentions that blood cultures should be performed under suitable conditions to isolate the organism in more than 90 per cent of cases of endocarditis. This suggests that multiple cultures may be necessary to achieve a high probability of identifying the pathogenic organism. The document 'Infective endocarditis with negative blood cultures. An analysis of 52 cases' also discusses the importance of repeated culture sampling, as patients with negative initial blood cultures often responded to empiric antibiotic therapy and had improved outcomes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
