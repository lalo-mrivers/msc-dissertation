["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents suggest that bone mineral density peak acquisition takes place earlier in women than in men. Based on the document 'Measurement of bone mineral content and bone density in healthy twelve-year-old white females', we can infer that it's possible to establish baseline bone mass and bone density values for young women. Additionally, from the document 'Sex differences in the acquisition of total bone mineral mass peak assessed through dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry', we know that males show a positive correlation between total bone mineral mass and age, but not in females. Therefore, it's reasonable to start monitoring bone mineral density in females as early as possible, which is during their teenage years.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
