["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The paper 'Management of varicella-zoster virus infection during pregnancy and the peripartum' states that nonimmune adults, including pregnant women, are at greater risk for complications and mortality when they contract varicella. Since the patient acquires chickenpox 3 days prior to delivery, we can assume she is not immune to the virus. The paper also mentions that the incidence of varicella during pregnancy is low, one to five per 10,000 pregnancies.\n\nThe paper 'Varicella in pregnancy, the fetus, and the newborn: problems in management' states that estimates on risk to the fetus vary widely, making counseling difficult. However, it does not mention any specific risks or complications associated with delivering within 3 days of acquiring chickenpox.\n\nThe paper 'Herpes zoster during pregnancy' reports a case where a woman developed herpes zoster at 37 weeks' gestation and delivered a normal infant without any sequelae. This suggests that the risk to the baby from varicella acquired in utero is relatively low.\n\nTherefore, considering all these factors, it can be concluded that the patient's baby will not develop neonatal varicella syndrome or have any significant complications due to the mother acquiring chickenpox 3 days prior to delivery.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
