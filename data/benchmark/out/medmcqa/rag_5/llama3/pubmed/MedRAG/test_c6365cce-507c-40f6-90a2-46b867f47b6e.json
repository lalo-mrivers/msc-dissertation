["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Axonal transport refers to the movement of organelles, proteins, or other materials along the length of an axon. The documents provide information on different types of axonal transport, including fast and slow transport, as well as motor proteins involved in these processes. From this information, we can infer that there are at least two types of axonal transport: antegrade (toward the terminal) and retrograde (away from the terminal). The document 'Mechanism of axonal transport: a proposed role for calcium ions' suggests that calcium ions are involved in the initiation of axonal transport, which supports the idea that there is movement along the length of the axon. Therefore, it can be concluded that axonal transport includes both antegrade and retrograde movements.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
