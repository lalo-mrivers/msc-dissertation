["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the document 'Reference values for the ambulatory blood pressure and the blood pressure measured at home: a population study', we can see that the 95th centile for daytime ambulatory pressures in women below age 50 is 132/85 mmHg. Since the question asks about systolic blood pressure, we can consider only this value. The mean systolic blood pressure in the sample population of elderly females was 125 mm Hg, and the standard deviation was 10. To find the 95th centile, we need to add 1.645 (which is the z-score for a two-tailed test with 5% level of significance) to the mean value, which gives us approximately 135.45 mm Hg.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
