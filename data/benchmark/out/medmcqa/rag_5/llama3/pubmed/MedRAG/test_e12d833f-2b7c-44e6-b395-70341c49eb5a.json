["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about a healthy center that reports 40 to 50 cases per week in the community. This week there are 48 cases normally. The answer is one of the options: Epidemic, Sporadic, Endemic, or Outbreak. Since the number of cases is consistent with the expected range and there is no unusual increase, it is unlikely to be an epidemic or outbreak. An endemic refers to a constant presence or prevalence of a disease in a population over time. The description does not suggest this as well. Therefore, the most likely answer is B: Sporadic.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
