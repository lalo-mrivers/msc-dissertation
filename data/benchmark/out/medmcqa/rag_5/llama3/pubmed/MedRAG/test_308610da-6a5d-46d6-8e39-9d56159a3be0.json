["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe urine glucose testing as a method to monitor blood glucose levels. The 'Relationship between urinary and blood glucose in diabetic children' document states that 0% glucosuria is associated with 'average' blood glucose concentrations less than 6.4 mmol/l, while over 5% glycosuria is associated with concentrations greater than 11.3 mmol/l. This suggests that the presence of glucose in urine is related to blood glucose levels. The other documents also support this idea, describing urine glucose testing as a reliable backup for whole blood glucose monitoring and highlighting potential procedural problems in whole blood glucose monitoring.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
