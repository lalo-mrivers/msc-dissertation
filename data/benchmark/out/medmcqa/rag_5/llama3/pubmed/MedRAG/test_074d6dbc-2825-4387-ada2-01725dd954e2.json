["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks how interstitial fluid volume can be determined. The provided documents discuss the importance of intracellular volume, the composition and function of interstitium, hydraulic regulation of brain parenchymal volume, and changes in interstitial pressure during acute interstitial volume depletion. Based on these concepts, it is clear that interstitial fluid volume is related to interstitial pressure and compliance. The document discussing changes in interstitial pressure during acute interstitial volume depletion provides a mathematical expression for effective interstitial compliance.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
