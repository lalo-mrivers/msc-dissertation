["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the location of mesial marginal developmental groove. We need to look for information related to dental development, grooves, or defects in the provided documents. The first document mentions cementoenamel defects appearing as vertical grooves at the cervical margins on the facial surfaces of the maxillary incisors. This is not directly related to the question. The second and third documents are also unrelated to the topic. The fourth document discusses radiographic assessment of proximal infrabony pocket topography, which does not mention developmental grooves or defects. Therefore, we need to look at the first three documents again. Upon reviewing them, there is no specific information that directly answers this question.\n\nHowever, the third document 'Disturbances and defects in enamel development' mentions ameloblastic disturbances being correlated with defects in enamel. Experimental disturbances created by tetracyclines, fluorides, and antimitotic drugs are emphasized. Cellular alterations are shown to interfere with both matrix production and secretion. Defects in enamel formation are characterized by abnormal crystal size and distribution.\n\nWe also have the document 'Cementoenamel defects in an unusual location' which mentions vertical grooves at the cervical margins on the facial surfaces of the maxillary incisors.\n\nConsidering all this information, we can infer that mesial marginal developmental groove is seen in maxillary lateral incisor.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
