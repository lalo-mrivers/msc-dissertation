["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the document 'Prosthesis design for osseointegrated implants in the edentulous maxilla', we know that anatomy limits the amount of bone available for placement of osseointegrated implants. The position of osseointegrated implants in the edentulous maxilla is dictated by available bone and can vary widely among patients. For a ridge with 2 Implants of size 4 mm, we need to consider the minimum width required to accommodate these implants. Considering the variability of implant placement, multiple prosthesis designs are needed in the maxilla. Therefore, we should look for another document that provides more specific information on the minimum width required.\n\nFrom the document 'Jawbone enlargement using immediate implant placement associated with a split-crest technique and guided tissue regeneration', we see that implants were placed with a gain in bone width, varying between 1 and 4 mm. This suggests that the minimum width required for 2 Implants of size 4 mm would be at least 8 mm (4 mm per implant). However, this is not specific to the case where there are 2 Implants of size 4 mm.\n\nFrom the document 'Characterization of porosity of isostatically pressed and sintered nickel-base powdered metal', we can learn about the importance of controlled porosity characteristics in implants. This information does not provide any insight into the minimum width required for the ridge.\n\nThe document 'Enhancement of the damaged edentulous ridge to receive dental implants: a combination of allograft and the GORE-TEX membrane' discusses repairing severely resorbed edentulous ridges but does not provide information on the minimum width required.\n\nTherefore, we should look at other sources or estimates to determine the minimum width required. A common guideline is that the minimum width required for 2 Implants of size 4 mm would be around 14-16 mm, considering the implant diameter and spacing. Based on this estimate, we can choose the answer.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C: 17 mm\"\n}"]
