["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To calculate the net filtration pressure, we need to subtract the blood side pressure (PBC) from the glomerular capillary pressure (PGC). The formula would be PGC - PBC. Given the values PGC = 42 mm Hg and PBC = 16 mm Hg, we can plug in these numbers: 42 - 16 = 26 mm Hg. However, this is not the final answer because it does not account for the pressure at the glomerular capillary-lumen interface (pGC). We need to subtract pGC from PGC to get the net filtration pressure. So, we have 42 - 12 = 30 mm Hg. Finally, no proteins were filtered, so this value is not affected.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: 28 mm Hg\"\n}"]
