["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question describes a child who was weaned from breast milk on the 5th day and given sugarcane juice, leading to hypoglycemia and hepatomegaly. Biochemical examination showed hypophosphatemia and enzyme deficiencies-reducing substances in urine. Fructose is present in sugarcane juice, so the child's symptoms are consistent with a fructose-related disorder. Genetically determined abnormalities of haemoglobin, haemoglobin synthesis and red cell enzymes are common in the tropics where this child lives. The child has a deficiency in an enzyme involved in carbohydrate metabolism which can be suspected clinically. Considering that sugarcane juice contains fructose, the child is probably suffering from Fructokinase deficiency.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
