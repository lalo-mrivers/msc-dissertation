["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents mention the composition of ligamentum flavum. In 'Hypertrophied ligamentum flavum in lumbar spinal canal stenosis', it is mentioned that the ligamentum flavum along with the medial one-third of the superior facet was obtained en bloc to include the enthesis, and statistically significant differences in transverse area and thickness of the ligamentum flavum were evident compared to the control group (P < 0.01). This suggests that the composition of the ligamentum flavum might be different from the control group. In 'Studies of elastic tissue formation in the developing bovine ligamentum nuchae', it is mentioned that the elastic fibre comprised a core of fine elastin fibrils (100--130 nm diameter) and a surrounding mantle of microfibrillar protein. This suggests that the ligamentum flavum might contain elastic fibres.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
