["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The provided documents do not specifically mention the imperative X-ray angle for root fracture. However, we can deduce some information from the papers. The 'Removing broken roots--a simple method' paper does not provide relevant information on this topic. The 'Delayed treatment of a mid-root fracture' paper discusses radiolucent lesions and healing, but it doesn't specify an X-ray angle. The 'Management of vertical root fracture in endodontically treated teeth' paper is focused on management strategies rather than specific imaging angles. The 'Fractures in previously abnormal parts' paper discusses fractures in defective or deformed bones, which is not directly related to the topic. Finally, the 'Treatment of root fracture with accompanying resorption using cermet cement' paper does not provide any information on X-ray angles either. Therefore, we can conclude that none of the provided documents explicitly state the imperative X-ray angle for root fracture.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A: 45°,\t90°\"\n}"]
