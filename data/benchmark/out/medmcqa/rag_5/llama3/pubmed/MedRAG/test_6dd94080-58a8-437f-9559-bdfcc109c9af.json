["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about dustless alginate production. Alginate impression material is mentioned in the first document, which discusses airborne particles resulting from handling alginate impression material. The third document discusses respirable particulates generated by pressurized consumer products, including alginate beads produced via internal gelation. This information suggests that alginate itself can produce airborne particles. Therefore, it's possible to consider modifying the alginate production process to reduce or eliminate these particles. One method mentioned in the fourth document is altering the matrix.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
