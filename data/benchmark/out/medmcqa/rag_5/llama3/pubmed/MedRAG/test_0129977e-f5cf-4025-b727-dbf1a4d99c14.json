["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents discuss the slow wave as a propagating depolarization of myogenic origin. In the context of gastrointestinal motility, the slow wave is described as controlling contractile activity by triggering action potential bursts in the intestine and stomach. The review highlights the recent characterizations of the slow wave and its mechanisms, which are closely coupled to metabolic processes. Therefore, considering the origins of the slow wave, it can be concluded that slow wave potential originates in smooth muscle cells.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
