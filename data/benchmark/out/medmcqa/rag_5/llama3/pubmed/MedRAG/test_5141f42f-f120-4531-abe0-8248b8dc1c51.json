["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's HbF level is 90%, which is significantly higher than the normal range. This suggests that the patient has a fetal hemoglobin dominant anemia. The presence of HbA2 at 3% also supports this diagnosis. Given the high level of HbF, it is likely that the patient has a beta-thalassemia or sickle cell disease with a high degree of HbF production. This would lead to the formation of fetal hemoglobin in place of adult hemoglobin. On the peripheral smear, this would be characterized by the presence of target cells and nucleated red blood cells.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
