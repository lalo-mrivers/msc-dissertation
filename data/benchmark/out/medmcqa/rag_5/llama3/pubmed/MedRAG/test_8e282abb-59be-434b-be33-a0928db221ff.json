["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks for a tertiary monoblock system of obturation of the root canal. From the provided documents, we can see that Calcium hydroxide is not the principal factor in success following its use (Calcium Hydroxide: The Ultimate Medicament?). Instead, endodontic success is related to the obliteration of the canal system with a solid core root canal filling such as gutta percha. This suggests that gutta percha may be used for obturation. However, Resilon monoblock obturation and Active Gutta Percha are options that specifically mention monoblock obturation, which implies that they do not involve multiple layers of material like traditional gutta percha obturation does. Given the description of tertiary monoblock system, we can infer that it refers to a single layer of material used for obturation. This rules out option D, which involves two different materials (Gutta Percha and AH plus sealer). Therefore, the most likely answer is Resilon monoblock obturation.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
