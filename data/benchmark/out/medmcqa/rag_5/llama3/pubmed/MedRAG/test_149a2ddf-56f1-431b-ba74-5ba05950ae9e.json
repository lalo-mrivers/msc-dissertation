["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the divergence from contact area in proximal surfaces that causes embrasures. Proximal surfaces refer to the surfaces of adjacent teeth that come into contact with each other. Embrasures are the spaces between these surfaces. Since the relevant documents do not directly address this topic, we need to find a connection between the provided information and the question.\n\nThe key phrase is 'causes embrasures'. This suggests a relationship with the shape or configuration of the proximal surfaces. The first document talks about SEM investigation of enamel surfaces after simulated clinical acid etching for pit and fissure sealants. It mentions that longer etching times produce more enamel surface relief, permitting better sealant adaption to the enamel.\n\nThe second document discusses regional variation in permeability of young dentin. However, this does not directly relate to the question about divergence from contact area.\n\nThe third document talks about expression of syndecan, a putative low affinity fibroblast growth factor receptor, in the early mouse embryo. This is also not relevant to the current question.\n\nThe fourth document describes a technique for removing junctional epithelium from the epithelial attachment zone and compares the extracellular attachment substance in controls with that remaining on cementum previously in contact with junctional epithelium. While this study has some relevance to dental surfaces, it does not address the topic of divergence from contact area.\n\nThe fifth document investigates the effect of acid etching on enamel, dentin, and the inner surface of the resin restoration. It talks about SEM photographs showing differences between etched and unetched surfaces.\n\nBased on these documents, we can infer that a divergence from contact area in proximal surfaces might refer to changes in shape or configuration of adjacent teeth that could cause embrasures. The documents do not provide direct answers, but they suggest that enamel surface relief, dentin permeability, and epithelial attachment substance composition may be relevant factors.\n\nThe answer must be chosen based on this analysis.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: Facially, lingually, cervically & occlusally\""]
