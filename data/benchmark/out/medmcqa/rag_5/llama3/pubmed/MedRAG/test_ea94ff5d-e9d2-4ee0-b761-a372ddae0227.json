["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the consequences of increasing the interocclusal distance beyond its physiologic limits. According to the provided documents, a case that was expanded by more than 1 mm showed a greater propensity toward relapse, and those cases with final intercuspid width of 28 mm or more showed significantly less stability than those with final intercuspid width less than 27 mm. This suggests that increasing the interocclusal distance beyond its physiologic limits can lead to problems such as relapse. The relevant document supporting this conclusion is 'The mandibular dental arch: part III. Buccal expansion.'.\", \"answer_choice\": B}"]
