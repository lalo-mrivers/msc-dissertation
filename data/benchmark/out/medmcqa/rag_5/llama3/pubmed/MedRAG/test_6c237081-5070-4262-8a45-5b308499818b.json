["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The case report 'Primary herpetic gingivostomatitis accompanying lesions on fingers: report of case' describes an 18-year-old white man with primary herpetic gingivostomatitis. The Common lesions of the oral mucosa article mentions that some otherwise healthy patients may have a more severe variant, such as acute herpetic gingivostomatitis, which can occur in young persons. The Herpetic whitlow as part of genital virus infection article does not provide information about primary herpetic gingivostomatitis age range. The Eczema herpeticum: atopic dermatitis complicated by primary herpetic gingivostomatitis article does not provide information about primary herpetic gingivostomatitis age range either. Therefore, based on the case report and general information in the Common lesions of the oral mucosa article, primary herpetic gingivostomatitis usually occurs between ages 13 to 30.\", \"answer_choice\": B}"]
