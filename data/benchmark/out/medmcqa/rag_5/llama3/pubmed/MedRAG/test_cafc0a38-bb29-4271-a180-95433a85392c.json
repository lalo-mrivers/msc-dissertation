["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Since remoxipride is a specific D2 dopamine antagonist (from the second document), it does not seem to be directly related to serotonin receptors. However, considering the mechanisms of atypical antipsychotic drugs mentioned in the first document, and that remoxipride was found to have functional similarity with other D2 antagonists in self-administration paradigms, we can hypothesize that prucalopride might be a 5HT4 agonist. This is supported by the fact that Tiapride, another neuroleptic, was found to accumulate in the pituitary gland of the rat (from the fourth document), which does not directly relate to dopamine or serotonin receptors, but could be related to prucalopride's mechanism.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
