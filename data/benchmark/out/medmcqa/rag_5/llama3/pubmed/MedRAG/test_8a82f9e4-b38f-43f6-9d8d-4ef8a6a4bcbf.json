["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with fever, fatigue, jaundice, yellow-colored urine, and clay-colored stools, which are typical symptoms of acute viral hepatitis. The LFTs show a significant elevation in bilirubin, ALT, and AST levels, consistent with liver dysfunction. Given the presence of scleral icterus, which suggests a severe form of liver disease, I would focus on investigating for hepatitis B and C. IgM anti-HBc is important to identify recent onset of hepatitis B infection. IgM anti-HBC is also important as it can differentiate between acute and chronic hepatitis B. HBsAg is necessary to confirm the presence of hepatitis B surface antigen-positive patients who tend to have a more severe clinical illness and greater biochemical derangement. Anti-HCV is crucial to rule out hepatitis C infection.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
