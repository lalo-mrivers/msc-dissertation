["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The concept of protective co-contraction is related to motor learning and control. The relevant document 'Motor learning and control: a working hypothesis' states that the acquisition of skills occurs through selective inhibition of unnecessary muscular activity rather than the activation of additional motor units. This suggests that antagonistic muscle groups fire during movement in an attempt to protect the injured part. Option D is true as it describes the mechanism of protective co-contraction, which is altered sensory input or pain causing the antagonistic muscle groups to fire during movement to protect the injured part.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
