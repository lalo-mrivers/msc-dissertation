["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the relationship between lactose malabsorption and milk lactose intolerance. The study found that milk A (no lactose) produced no gastrointestinal symptoms in either sufficient or insufficient persons, milk B (12.5 g of lactose) produced symptoms in 3.8% of sufficient and 37.1% of insufficient individuals, and Milk C (37.5 g of lactose) induced symptoms in 7.6% of sufficient and 83.5% of insufficient subjects. This suggests that the amount of lactose in milk is directly related to the frequency of symptoms. The individual sensitivity to lactose study found that some patients experienced discomfort after provocation with increasing amounts of lactose, which further supports this relationship. Therefore, we can infer that the patient's lactase deficiency is likely due to his intolerance to dairy products containing lactose.\n\nThe options provided are all types of milk or dairy products that contain lactose, except for one: condensed milk does not necessarily contain lactose. Condensed milk is made by evaporating milk to remove excess water and can be made from any type of milk (including non-lactose-containing milks). Therefore, it is the least likely to cause lactose intolerance among these options.\", \n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
