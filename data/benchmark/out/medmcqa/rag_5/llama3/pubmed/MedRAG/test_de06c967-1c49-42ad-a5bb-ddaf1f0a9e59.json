["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about an animal model that demonstrates vasomotor reversal of Dale. Vasomotor reversal of Dale refers to the phenomenon where a vasoconstrictor effect is initially observed followed by a vasodilator response. This can be demonstrated by stimulating alpha-1 receptors, which causes vasoconstriction, and then blocking them while simultaneously stimulating beta-2 receptors, which causes vasodilation.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
