["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about high molecular weight proteins seen only in humans. The documents provided describe various protein aggregates in human cataractous lenses, including high molecular weight species. From the information, we can infer that the high molecular weight proteins are specifically mentioned as being associated with human cataract. There is no mention of these proteins being present in other species or animals, which suggests that they are unique to humans.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"]
