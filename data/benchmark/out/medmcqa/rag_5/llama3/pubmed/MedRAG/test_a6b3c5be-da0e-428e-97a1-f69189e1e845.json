["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about a 7-year-old child with deep carious lesions on multiple teeth but no pain. The relevant information from the provided documents is that odontomes can have locally harmful effects on the developing dentition, and caries is a common oral affliction in children. Since there is no pain, it suggests that the carious lesions are likely advanced and may not be amenable to non-invasive treatments like indirect pulp capping or pulpotomy. Therefore, the treatment plan should focus on eliminating the carious lesions to prevent further damage. RCT (root canal treatment) of all teeth could be a viable option considering the extent of the caries.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"]
