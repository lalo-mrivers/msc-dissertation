["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about ionic exchange between the enamel surface and environment. The relevant documents describe properties of apatite membranes (tooth enamel) such as permselectivity, adsorption, and interaction with ions. From these descriptions, it can be inferred that enamel surfaces have affinity for ions and can be modified by incorporating certain inorganic ions, which affects the adsorption and activity of proteins like acid phosphatase. This suggests that ionic exchange continues to occur between the enamel surface and environment. Furthermore, the document 'Characteristics of the proteins of tooth enamel' mentions the interaction between Ca2+ and amino acid residues, indicating a continuous process.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
