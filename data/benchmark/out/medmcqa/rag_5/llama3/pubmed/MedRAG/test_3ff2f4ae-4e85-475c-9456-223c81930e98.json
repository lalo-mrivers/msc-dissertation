["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the pattern of enamel prism demineralization. Based on the provided documents, specifically 'Enamel apatite: chemistry, structure and properties' and 'Molecular mechanisms in dental hard tissue mineralization', we know that enamel is a non-collagenous matrix with amelogenin as its primary component. The paper 'Matrix--mineral relationships in enamel tissues' also discusses the composition of enamel protein. Since the documents do not provide direct information on the demineralization pattern, I will rely on general knowledge about enamel prism structure and properties to make an educated guess.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C\n}"]
