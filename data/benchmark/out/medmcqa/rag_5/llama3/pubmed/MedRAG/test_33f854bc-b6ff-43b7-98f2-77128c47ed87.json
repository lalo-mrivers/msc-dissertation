["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents provide information about the trapezium bone and its surrounding muscles. In 'Bipartite trapezium with adduction contracture of the thumb: a case report', it is mentioned that the patient presented with a painless protrusion at the base of the first metacarpal bone associated with an adduction contracture of the thumb. This suggests that there may be some abnormality in the shape or structure of the trapezium muscle. In 'Anatomical study of distal insertion of the abductor pollicis longus. Concept of a new musculo-tendinous unit: the abductor carpi muscle', it is mentioned that the first dorsal compartment of the wrist contains one or two tendons belonging to the 'abductor carpi' muscle, inserting in the trapezium and acting almost together with other units going to the first metacarpal. This information does not directly provide information about the shape of the trapezium muscle.\n\nHowever, in 'Architectural design of the human intrinsic hand muscles', it is mentioned that several specialized architectural designs were observed: lumbrical muscles had an extremely high fiber length/muscle length ratio, implying a design toward high excursion. The first dorsal interosseous and adductor pollicis had physiologic cross-sectional areas comparable to those of extrinsic muscles and much greater than those of the other intrinsic muscles. This information does not provide direct insight into the shape of the trapezium muscle.\n\nIn 'Functional anatomy and biomechanics of the thumb', it is mentioned that each thumb joint has a mechanical equivalent that helps explain elements of thumb stability. The trapeziometacarpal joint is potentially the most unstable but has adapted to its unique position by special joint geometry and, in particular, a combination of support ligaments that permit a wide range of motion yet stability. This information does not provide direct insight into the shape of the trapezium muscle.\n\nIn 'Simultaneous dorsal trapezium-scaphoid and trapezoid-carpal subluxations', it is mentioned that the mechanism may have been axial loading in extension or flexion. Two modes of treatment, closed and open, were needed for the two injuries. This information does not provide direct insight into the shape of the trapezium muscle.\n\nThe documents collectively do not provide direct insight into the shape of the trapezium muscle. However, the 'Bipartite trapezium with adduction contracture of the thumb: a case report' suggests that there may be some abnormality in the shape or structure of the trapezium muscle. The architectural design and biomechanics of the intrinsic hand muscles do not provide direct insight into the shape of the trapezium muscle.\n\nGiven this information, it can be inferred that the shape of the trapezium muscle is likely to be\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
