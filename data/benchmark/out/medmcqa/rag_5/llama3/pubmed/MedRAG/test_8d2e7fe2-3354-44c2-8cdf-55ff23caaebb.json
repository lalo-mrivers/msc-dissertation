["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the sharpest cusp. The relevant documents describe cusp configurations influenced by various occlusal determinants. Part II of 'Application of \\\"cusp writer\\\" findings to practical and theoretical occlusal problems' explains that the steepness of the curve of Spee determines the relative cusp height and angulation of one tooth to another, from an anterior to a posterior direction in the dental arch. The steeper the curve of Spee, the more irregular the cusp height and angulations are with steeper anterior cusps and flatter posterior cusps.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
