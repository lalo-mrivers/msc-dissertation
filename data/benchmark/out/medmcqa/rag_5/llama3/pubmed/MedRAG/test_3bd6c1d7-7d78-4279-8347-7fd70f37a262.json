["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the trigger for myosin head detachment from actin. Based on the given documents, we can see that the movement of actin-myosin filaments is regulated by phosphorylation of the regulatory light chain of smooth muscle myosin. The ATPase activity of myosin filaments in solution and actin movement in an in vitro motility assay are efficiently regulated by this phosphorylation. Additionally, a physical model of ATP-induced actin-myosin movement in vitro suggests that the sliding velocity is limited by the balance between the force generated by myosin cross-bridges and frictional drag exerted by other myosin cross-bridges. This implies that the detachment of myosin heads from actin is triggered by the hydrolysis of ATP to ADP and Pi, which generates a force producing sliding between actin and myosin.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
