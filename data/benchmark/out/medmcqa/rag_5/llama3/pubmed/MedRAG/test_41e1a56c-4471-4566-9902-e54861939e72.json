["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about an apical radiolucent area present in a central incisor after 4 months of root canal treatment (RCT). The relevant documents are studies on apical surgery, differential diagnosis of periapical radiolucent lesions, and clinical and radiographic study of dens invaginatus.
