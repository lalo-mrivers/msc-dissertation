["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about Pharyngeal Pseudosulcus. From the provided documents, there are two relevant passages that mention pseudosulcus-like conditions. One is from 'Pseudotumours of the oropharynx due to muscular contraction' and another is from 'Acute parapharyngeal space infections'. In the first passage, it describes normal filling defects in the barium-filled oropharynx which result from the contraction, elevation and backward pulling of the soft palate. This is similar to Pharyngeal Pseudosulcus. In the second passage, it talks about tonsillitis being a common source of infection. Therefore, considering these points, I conclude that Pharyngeal Pseudosulcus is seen secondary to muscular contraction.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
