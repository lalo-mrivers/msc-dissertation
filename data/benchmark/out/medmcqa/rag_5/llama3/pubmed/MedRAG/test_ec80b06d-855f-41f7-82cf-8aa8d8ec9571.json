["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about Group 2 sensory fibers. The provided documents describe various types of nerve endings and receptors. We can look at the document 'Sensory and motor innervation of bird intrafusal muscle fibers' which mentions that most bird muscle spindles are supplied by only one primary afferent, and two types of motor terminal are recognized which can be referred to specific types of intrafusal fiber. This implies that different sensory fibers may have distinct endings or attachments. None of the provided options seem directly related to this information. However, we can look at the document 'Neural-epithelial interactions in sensory receptors' which mentions specificity of terminal epithelial element provides a degree of specificity to the cytologic pattern of the terminal receptor. This might suggest that different types of sensory fibers have distinct attachments or endings.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
