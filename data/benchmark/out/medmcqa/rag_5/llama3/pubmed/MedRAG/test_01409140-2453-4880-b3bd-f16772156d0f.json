["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the management of a fracture passing through mental foramen in mandible with less than 10 mm of bone. This type of fracture would typically require intraoral open reduction as mentioned in 'Intraoral open reduction'. The technique advocated in this method includes observation, closed reduction with maxillomandibular fixation (MMF), transoral reduction, and intraosseous wire fixation among others. Since the fracture has less than 10 mm of bone, it would likely require a simpler approach such as MMF or intraosseous wire fixation.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
