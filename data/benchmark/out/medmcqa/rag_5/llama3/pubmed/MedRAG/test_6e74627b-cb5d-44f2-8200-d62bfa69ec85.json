["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about a 10-year-old girl with a mass in the lower abdomen involving umbilical and hypogastrium. The mass is cystic and mobile, and the examiner cannot insert fingers between the mass and the pelvic bone. This information suggests that the mass is likely located within the pelvis.
