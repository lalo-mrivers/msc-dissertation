["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about an acid neutralizing substance in saliva. The passage 'Nitrosamine formation in human saliva.' mentions that acidification of saliva greatly increased the nitrosamine yield. This suggests that there may be a base present in saliva, which could neutralize the acidic conditions and increase the nitrosamine yield. The passage 'Evidence for the presence of carbamino compounds in human saliva.' also discusses bicarbonate concentrations of whole saliva and protein-free filtrates, indicating that bicarbonate is present in saliva. Therefore, it is likely that the acid neutralizing substance in saliva is bicarbonate.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
