["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking which tooth has C-shaped canal. We have three documents that describe different teeth: mandibular second molars, mandibular first premolars, and maxillary/premolars. In the document 'C-shaped canal configurations in mandibular molars', it is mentioned that these clinical findings were similar for each case, including continuous hemorrhage and sensitivity when instruments were used. This suggests that C-shaped canals are present in mandibular second molars. The same information is also repeated in another document 'Anatomical and histological features of C-shaped canals in mandibular second molars'. Therefore, it is likely that the tooth with C-shaped canal is a mandibular 2nd molar.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
