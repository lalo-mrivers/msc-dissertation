["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"After reviewing the relevant documents, I found that dental caries can occur after radiotherapy treatment. The paper 'Dental caries after radiotherapy of the oral regions' discusses how radiation-induced xerostomia (decrease in salivary flow) contributes to the development of these lesions.
