["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) as a site where immune responses occur. In the first document, it is mentioned that GALT is located in the intestinal tract and that B immunoblasts generated in this region are discharged into the intestinal lymph.
