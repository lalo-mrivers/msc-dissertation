["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the main producer of amniotic fluid. The provided documents mention that albumin is known to reach amniotic fluid by transamniotic diffusion from maternal blood. This implies that the amnion plays a role in regulating movement of proteins, including alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), into the maternal circulation.
