["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"After reviewing the documents, I noticed that 'Idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus-- a report of 73 patients' does not mention anything about increased intracranial pressure. The document 'Effect of dose and dose schedule on the response of intracranial pressure to mannitol' talks about controlling increased ICP using mannitol, but it does not discuss symptoms associated with ICP. 'Intracranial pressure and pressure volume relation in patients with subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH)' mentions the development of ICP after SAH, but again does not mention symptoms. 'Volume and pressure in the craniospinal axis' provides general information about intracranial hypertension and its effects, but does not discuss specific symptoms. 'The low intracranial pressure syndrome' is about a condition where ICP is abnormally low, not increased.\n\nOn the other hand, one of the documents ('Effect of dose and dose schedule on the response of intracranial pressure to mannitol') suggests that somnolence (drowsiness) can be a symptom of increased ICP. The other options, headache, nausea/vomiting, and muscle twitching, are all plausible symptoms of increased ICP.\n\nTherefore, based on the documents provided, it is unlikely that muscle twitching is not true about increased intracranial pressure. Muscle twitching does not seem to be mentioned in any of the documents as a symptom of increased ICP.\n\nThe answer choice should be: C\", \n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
