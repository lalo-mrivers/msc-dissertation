["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the most likely cause of hypotension after 3 minutes of administration of epidural anesthesia with Xylocaine. From the given documents, we can see that Xylocaine is a local anesthetic agent used for epidural analgesia. Since the patient develops hypotension suddenly, it's unlikely to be due to systemic absorption of the drug or allergy to the drug preparation as these effects would take longer time to occur. The vasovagal effect is also less likely as this would not be directly related to the administration of the local anesthetic agent. Therefore, the most likely cause is Penetration into the subarachnoid space, which could lead to hypotension due to spinal anesthesia.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
