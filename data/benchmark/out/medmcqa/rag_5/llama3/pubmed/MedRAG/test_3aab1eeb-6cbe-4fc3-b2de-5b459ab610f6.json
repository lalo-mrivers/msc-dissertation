["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about acceptable investigations at day 3 of presentation for a suspected patient of dengue. The relevant documents mention viral culture and isolation using C6/36 cell line, ELISA for antibody against dengue virus, and NS I antigen detection. However, the document 'Dengue virus replication in cultures of peripheral blood leukocytes during the course of dengue haemorrhagic fever' suggests that leukocyte donors, children hospitalized with primary or secondary dengue infections, were studied during the acute and convalescent stages of illness. It is mentioned that D2 virus replication occurred infrequently in PBL cultures obtained from children before the 10th day after onset of symptoms, but frequently thereafter. This implies that it may take some time for the virus to replicate in leukocytes, making it less likely to be detectable at day 3.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
