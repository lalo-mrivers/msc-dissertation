["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, we can analyze each option to determine which one measures the antempasterior relation of jaws. Option A, ANB angle, is related to sagittal jaw movement but does not specifically measure the relationship between anterior and posterior aspects of the jaws. Options B and C are both related to skull dimensions, but do not provide information about the antempasterior relation of jaws. Option D, facial angle, can be used to describe the shape of the face, but is not a direct measurement of the antempasterior relation of jaws.\n\nThe document 'The measurement of jaw movement' discusses an apparatus that measures jaw movements in three planes, including sagittal, coronal, and horizontal planes. This suggests that the apparatus may have the capability to measure the antempasterior relation of jaws.\n\nHowever, the most relevant information can be found in the document 'The relationship between lateral border movements of the mandible and the determinants of occlusion'. The jaw movement analyzer used in this study recorded movement with 6 degrees of freedom and has the ability to accurately record the full range of jaw movement. This instrument could potentially measure the antempasterior relation of jaws.\n\nTherefore, considering all available information, it is most likely that the antempasterior relation of jaws is measured by: ...\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
