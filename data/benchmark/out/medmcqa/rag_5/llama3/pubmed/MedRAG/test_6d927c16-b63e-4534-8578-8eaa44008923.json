["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the provided documents, it is clear that partial anodontia refers to congenitally missing permanent teeth. The study on oligodontia states that 4.34% of the sample had congenitally missing teeth, which is consistent with the prevalence found in Black American children (2.57%). This suggests that partial anodontia may not be a syndrome specific to Black Americans, but rather a common condition affecting children and adolescents.
