["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about a drop in fetal heart rate that typically lasts less than 2 minutes and is associated with umbilical cord compression. We can look at the documents to find information about fetal heart rate changes and their possible causes. The document 'Abrupt fall in the fetal heart rate during labour' mentions an abrupt fall in the fetal heart rate of 50 beats within 3 minutes, without a demonstration of signs of recovery in the following 2 minutes. This could be related to umbilical cord compression. However, it's not exactly what we're looking for because the question specifies that the drop should typically last less than 2 minutes.\", \"answer_choice\": C}"]
