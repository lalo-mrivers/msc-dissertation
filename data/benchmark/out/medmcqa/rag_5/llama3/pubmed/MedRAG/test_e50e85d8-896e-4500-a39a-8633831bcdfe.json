["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the importance of a saliva buffer system in stimulated saliva. After reviewing the provided documents, we can see that none of the documents explicitly mention the term 'saliva buffer system' or its importance in stimulated saliva. However, one document (Nitrosamine formation in human saliva) mentions the presence of factors that accelerated and retarded the nitrosation reaction in saliva fractions. This suggests that there may be a buffer system present in saliva, but it is not explicitly stated to have low importance in stimulated saliva.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
