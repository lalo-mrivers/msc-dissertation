["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about an anaesthetic agent causing adrenal suppression. First, let's look for any relevant information in the provided documents. In the document 'Plasma ACTH in rats following medical adrenalectomy', we see that prolonged systemic glucocorticoid administration (medical adrenalectomy) can cause adrenal suppression. This suggests that a substance capable of inducing glucocorticoid-like effects could potentially cause adrenal suppression. In the document '[Problems of corticosteroid-induced adrenal insufficiency in surgery]', we learn that patients previously treated with corticosteroids have a high risk whenever surgery is undertaken, due to adrenal suppression caused by corticosteroid therapy. This information also suggests that substances capable of inducing glucocorticoid-like effects could cause adrenal suppression.\n\nIn the document 'Adrenocortical suppression by synthetic corticosteroid drugs: a comparative study of prednisolone and betamethasone', we see that synthetic corticosteroid drugs, such as prednisolone and betamethasone, can suppress adrenocortical function. This further supports the idea that substances capable of inducing glucocorticoid-like effects could cause adrenal suppression.\n\nConsidering these points, it is possible to identify an anaesthetic agent causing adrenal suppression from the provided choices. All anaesthetic agents have their own unique mechanisms of action and potential effects on the body. Etomidate, in particular, has been shown to inhibit cortisol synthesis and can cause adrenal insufficiency when used for prolonged periods. This information suggests that etomidate may be a suitable answer to this question.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the provided documents and the mechanisms of action of anaesthetic agents, it appears that etomidate is the most likely candidate for an anaesthetic agent causing adrenal suppression.\", \"answer_choice\": C}"]
