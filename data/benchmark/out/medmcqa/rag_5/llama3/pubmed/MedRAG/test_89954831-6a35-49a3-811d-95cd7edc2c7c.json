["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the mobility of HbS compared to normal hemoglobin on gel electrophoresis. We know that glutamic acid is replaced by valine, which leads to formation of sickle cell hemoglobin (HbS). There are no specific details provided in the relevant documents about the mobility of HbS or its comparison with normal hemoglobin on gel electrophoresis. However, we can analyze the given data and make some educated guesses based on the information available. For example, we know that certain mutations at the alpha chain surface affect the insolubility of deoxyhaemoglobin S. Similarly, we also know that the chemical nature of the substitution is decisive and points to the type of intermolecular bonding at several loci. This suggests that the mobility of HbS might be affected by the specific mutation.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: Unchanged.\""]
