["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant document that discusses maintaining parallelism between an object and film is 'Increasing contrast when viewing radiographic images'. This document states that illuminating a developed photographic film with parallel or nearly parallel light provides increased contrast. It also mentions that the viewer of radiographic images can obtain increased contrast simply by increasing the distance between the view box and the radiograph, since this results in more parallel incident light. Therefore, to maintain parallelism between an object and film, one should increase the target-to-object distance.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
