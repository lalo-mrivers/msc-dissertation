["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents mention post-neonatal infant deaths, which are a significant component of infant mortality. The first document highlights the importance of monitoring separate early and late neonatal mortality rates, with early neonatal deaths being concentrated at the start of the neonatal period. This suggests that early neonatal deaths may be a common cause of post-neonatal mortality. The second document discusses post-neonatal deaths in the Auckland Hospital Board area and notes a high rate of deaths from infection. Maori infants died from pneumonia at a rate 28 times that of European infants, suggesting an environmental or infectious cause. The fourth document emphasizes that infections are the third most common cause of perinatal mortality and neonatal mortality rates from infection are approximately 1:1000 live births.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"]
