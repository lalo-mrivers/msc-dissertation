["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about secondary colonizers, which implies that the microorganisms mentioned are not primary colonizers. The provided documents describe various ways in which bacteria can be present on or inside human bodies. From these texts, we can see that Candida yeasts are commensal and can metastasize to other regions when stimulated by a noxa (such as an eliciting bacterial infection). Skin bacteria can also produce antibiotics to defend against pathogens. In the oral cavity, plaque formation is influenced by ecological determinants. Tracheobronchial colonization occurs via host defense mechanisms, therapeutic interventions, and virulence of endogenous or exogenous bacteria.\n\nConsidering these contexts, S. sanguis (Streptococcus sanguis) is a primary colonizer in the oral cavity, involved in plaque formation. P. intermedia (Porphyromonas intermedia) and P. gingivalis (Porphyromonas gingivalis) are also oral bacteria that contribute to periodontitis. Fusobacteria are anaerobic bacteria found in various environments, including the human mouth.\n\nTherefore, all these microorganisms except one would be primary colonizers. The exception is Fusobacteria, which can be considered as a secondary colonizer. They may not have a primary role in plaque formation or periodontitis but could still be present in the oral cavity.\", \n\"answer_choice\": C"]
