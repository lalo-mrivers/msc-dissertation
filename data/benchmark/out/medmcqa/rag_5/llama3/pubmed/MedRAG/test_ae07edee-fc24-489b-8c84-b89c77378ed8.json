["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"After reviewing the provided documents, I can see that Addison's disease is a condition characterized by adrenocortical insufficiency. The primary document 'Primary Adrenocortical Insufficiency (Addison's Disease)' explicitly states that the etiology of most cases of adrenal gland atrophy or destruction is unknown, with autoimmune processes possibly being responsible.
