["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Beta-1,3-D Glucan testing is done to detect candidiasis. The relevant documents discuss beta-glucans and their synthesis in fungal cells, including the G test which measures beta-glucan levels. This test was used to diagnose candidiasis in a rabbit model. Therefore, beta-1,3-D Glucan testing is not necessary for diagnosing candidiasis.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
