["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the question, we are looking for a cause of elevated LDL levels with normal LDL receptors. This suggests that the issue is related to apolipoprotein B (ApoB) or its function. The passage about familial defective ApoB-100 mentions that this condition results from a single amino acid substitution in ApoB that prevents low-density lipoprotein from binding normally to the LDL receptor, leading to elevated plasma cholesterol levels. This is consistent with our scenario of normal LDL receptors but elevated LDL levels.\", \"answer_choice\": C}"]
