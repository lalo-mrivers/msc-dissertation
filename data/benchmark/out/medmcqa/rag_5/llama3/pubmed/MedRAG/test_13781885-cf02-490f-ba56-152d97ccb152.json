["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks how bacteria are most commonly engulfed. The provided documents discuss phagocytosis, which is a process by which cells ingest foreign particles or microorganisms. Phagocytosis is performed by 'professional phagocytes', such as neutrophilic leukocytes, which express unique membrane proteins and signal transduction mechanisms that facilitate the engulfment of bacteria. Therefore, it can be concluded that bacteria are most commonly engulfed by neutrophilic leukocytes.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
