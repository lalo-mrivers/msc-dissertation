["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with sudden nontraumatic visual loss at or below the 20/200 level. Normal examination findings suggest that the cause may not be an anterior segment disease or a posterior segment (vitreoretinal) condition. The fact that the patient had abdominal pain previously and presented again with vision loss suggests that there might be a retrobulbar (optic nerve) condition. Bilateral optic nerve hypoplasia is a possibility, although it's unusual for patients to have normal visual acuity. Abnormal head positions due to ocular problems are not relevant in this case. Measuring contrast sensitivity would also not provide any specific information about the diagnosis.
