["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the centre of activity of autonomic nervous system. The relevant documents describe the autonomic nervous system as having sympathetic, parasympathetic, and enteric subdivisions. The present review is focussed upon the highly specialized reflex organization and neurochemistry of sympathetic parasympathetic neurons. The neural mechanisms which integrate the autonomic and somatic motor activities during stressful behaviour are described. The paper also discusses how a range of neuroscientific techniques has started to reveal the specialized properties of functional pathways in the sympathetic system at molecular, cellular and integrative levels. Based on these descriptions, it can be inferred that the centre of activity of autonomic nervous system is likely to be located within the central nervous system, specifically the brain.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C\n}"]
