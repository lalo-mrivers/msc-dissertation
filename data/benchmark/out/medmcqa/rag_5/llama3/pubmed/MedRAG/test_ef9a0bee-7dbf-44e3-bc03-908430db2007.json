["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents highlight the importance of minimizing radiation exposure in dental radiology. The first document discusses improved-contrast radiography using narrow x-ray beams, which reduces the dose of radiation. The second and third documents emphasize the need to minimize unnecessary exposure to radiation, citing that dentistry's contribution to the population's total exposure is small. The fourth document recommends rectangular field collimation to reduce unnecessary exposure by 73-96%. Considering these points, we can infer that the maximum recommended dose for a dental X-ray operator in a week would be low.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
