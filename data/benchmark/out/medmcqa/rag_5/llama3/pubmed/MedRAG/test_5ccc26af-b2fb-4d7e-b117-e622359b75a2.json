["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to the 'Fracture thresholds in osteoporosis' document, the women with osteoporosis showed a significant decrease in bone mineral density (BMD) at the lumbar spine and femoral neck compared with age-matched normal women. The fracture threshold was defined as the 90th centile of spinal BMD for women with osteoporosis, which was 0.81 g/cm2 at the lumbar spine and 0.656 g/cm2 at the femoral neck. This suggests that screening should ideally start early enough to detect the decrease in BMD. Furthermore, 'Reduction of risk factors for osteoporosis among adolescents and young adults' emphasizes the importance of prevention, which must begin early in life. Therefore, it is reasonable to screen for osteoporosis at a minimum age.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
