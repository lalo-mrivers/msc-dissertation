["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"After reviewing the provided documents, I did not find any mention of 'Paradoxical undressing' or its relation to the topics discussed. Therefore, I will focus on the question itself. The options provided seem to be related to temperature-related disorders. Upon careful consideration, I realized that Parinaud's Sign is not mentioned in any of the documents, and it does not appear to be directly related to the given options. However, I did notice that one of the documents describes a patient with convergent-retraction nystagmus (Parinaud's Sign). This led me to investigate further. After reviewing the symptoms and characteristics described in the document, I concluded that none of the given options are directly related to Parinaud's Sign or Paradoxical undressing.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"None of the above\"\n}"]
