["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The phallic stage of Freud corresponds to the psychosexual development phase described by Mahler, which is focused on separation-individuation and reconstruction. Piaget's stages are cognitive developmental phases, whereas Freud's psychosexual stages are related to libidinal aims and objects. However, both theories aim to describe the early years of human development. According to Freud, the phallic stage corresponds to a period of psychosexual development where the child develops an awareness of their own genital organs and the difference between boys and girls. This is closely tied to the Oedipus complex.

Although there are some similarities in the age ranges, the focus of these stages differs significantly.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
