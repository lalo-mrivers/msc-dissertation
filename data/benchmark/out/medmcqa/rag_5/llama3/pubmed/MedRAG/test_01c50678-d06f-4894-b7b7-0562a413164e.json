["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe issues with polishing of composite fillings, specifically mentioning stained margins and rough surfaces. The first document suggests that polishability is interrelated with filler particle size and hardness. This implies that the hardness of the matrix and filler particles could be a factor in polishing difficulties. Additionally, the second document mentions controlling factors during placement to prevent defects, including maintaining adequate pressure during setting or curing of the composite. This implies that the hardness of the matrix and filler particles could also contribute to difficulties in achieving a smooth polish.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
