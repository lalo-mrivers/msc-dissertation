["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the maximum strain of the parturient heart. From the first document 'Cardiocirculatory adjustments during pregnancy -- an echocardiographic study', we know that cardiac output is increased throughout pregnancy, with a shift from an increased heart rate up to 20 weeks gestation and then stroke volume increasing significantly after 20 weeks. This means that there must be some point in time when the heart is working at its maximum capacity, likely towards the end of the second or third trimester. The document does not provide specific information on strain, but it suggests that cardiac output increases throughout pregnancy.\",\n\"answer_choice\": A"]
