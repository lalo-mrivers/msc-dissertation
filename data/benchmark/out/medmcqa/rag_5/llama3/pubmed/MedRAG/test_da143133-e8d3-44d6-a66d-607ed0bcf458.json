["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, I found that perioral tingling and numbness are mentioned as a potential side effect of sural nerve excision (The effects of sural nerve excision in autogenous nerve grafting). Since the question is about apheresis for platelet donation, I looked at the relevant document (The safety of preoperative autologous blood donation in the nonhospital setting) which mentions adverse events accompanying 24 of 928 donations (2.6%). Perioral numbness and tingling are not explicitly mentioned as a side effect of apheresis, but the use of citrate-based anticoagulant is mentioned as an adverse event. Therefore, I conclude that the correct answer is D: Due to citrate based anticoagulant.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
