["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about a patient with severe acidosis. The documents suggest that organic acidosis can occur in infants and treatment may involve half- to two-thirds-strength of physiological saline with 40 mEq/1 of potassium, but not bicarbonate. Lactic acidosis is also discussed, which is often treated by increasing oxygen delivery. Alkalosis is another condition mentioned, where buffering agents have not been shown to affect outcome. Since the patient has severe acidosis, lactic acidosis is a possible diagnosis. The study on dichloroacetate treatment for lactic acidosis found no significant difference in hemodynamics or survival between treatment and placebo groups. Therefore, we can conclude that there is no evidence to support using i.v. NaHCO3 or dichloroacetate in this patient.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
