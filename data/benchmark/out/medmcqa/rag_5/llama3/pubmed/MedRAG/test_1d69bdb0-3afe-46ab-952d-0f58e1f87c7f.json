["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the force applied to cause root movement. From the documents provided, we can look at the section on 'Measurement of edgewise torque force in vitro'. This section discusses the measurement of palatal root torque and states that the force was double halfway between the apex of a tooth and the arch wire compared to the force delivered at the apex. Additionally, it mentions that the smaller the number of teeth acted upon, the greater the force they received. This information suggests that the force applied should be related to the concept of torque or moment (B). Furthermore, in the section on 'On optimum orthodontic force theory as applied to canine retraction', it is stated that the center of resistance is at approximately midroot for a single-rooted tooth and that increasing the countertipping couple from zero causes the center of rotation to move. This information also supports the idea that torque or moment (B) should be used to cause root movement.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
