["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking what factors affect occlusal adjustment. Based on the provided documents, we can identify several key points. Firstly, from the document 'Effects of occlusal instability', we know that changes in an occlusion are either horizontal or vertical, and vertical changes require a more extensive treatment procedure. This suggests that occlusal adjustments are affected by the type of change occurring in the occlusion. Secondly, from the document 'Occlusal adjustment therapy for craniomandibular disorders', we learn that the effectiveness of occlusal adjustment can be tested using a double-blind method, which implies that factors such as counseling and placebos do not significantly impact the results. Finally, from the document 'Relations between occlusal interference and jaw muscle activities in response to changes in head position', we see that changes in head position can affect jaw muscle activity, but this is more related to the overall neuromuscular system rather than a specific factor affecting occlusal adjustment. Considering these points, it appears that postural position may be a factor that affects occlusal adjustment.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
