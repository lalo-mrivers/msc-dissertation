["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the suitable technique for diagnosing posterior interproximal caries in children. The provided documents mention various diagnostic techniques, including bite-wing radiography, panoramic radiography, and direct visual examination.\n\nIn 'An in vivo comparison of radiographic and directly assessed clinical caries status of posterior approximal surfaces in primary and permanent teeth', it is mentioned that the best radiographic survey for detecting enamel interproximal carious lesions was the combination of periapical plus posterior bitewing radiographs. This suggests that bite-wing radiography can be a suitable technique for diagnosing posterior interproximal caries.\n\nHowever, 'Comparison of interproximal carious lesion detection in panoramic and standard intraoral radiography' mentions that panoramic radiographs used alone were ineffective diagnostic aids in the detection of early interproximal carious lesions. This suggests that panoramic radiography is not a suitable technique for diagnosing posterior interproximal caries.\n\nTherefore, based on the provided information, bite-wing radiography with either Bisecting angle or Paralleling techniques can be considered as suitable techniques for diagnosing posterior interproximal caries in children.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A or B\""]
