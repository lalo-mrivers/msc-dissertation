["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the concentration of tropicamide. In the document 'Effective degree of mydriasis with phenylephrine and tropicamide', it is mentioned that 0.5% tropicamide was used to achieve maximum diameter of 8.0 mm in 30 min. This suggests that the concentration of tropicamide in this study is 0.5%. However, we need to consider other documents as well. In 'Factors determining the potency of mydriatic drugs in man', it is mentioned that 25 micrograms of tropicamide was used in micro drop formulation (50 micrograms per standard drop), which corresponds to a concentration of 1% (250 micrograms). Since the question asks about the concentration of tropicamide, not the dose or potency, we can consider this document as well. Therefore, based on these documents, we can conclude that the concentration of tropicamide is likely to be around 0.5%.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
