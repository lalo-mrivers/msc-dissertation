["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the property affected due to diameter of nerve fiber/axon. The documents provided describe the relationship between peripheral nerve fibers' size and their membrane properties, as well as the impact of myelinated fiber diameter on conduction velocity. Additionally, it is mentioned that caliber is a principal determinant of conduction velocity in myelinated nerve fibers. Therefore, we can conclude that conduction velocity is the property affected due to diameter of nerve fiber/axon.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
