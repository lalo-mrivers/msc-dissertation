["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the variation that involves 99.73% of the data. This is equivalent to saying that 99.73% of the data falls within 2 standard deviations (SD) from the mean, because 95% of the data typically falls within 1.96 SD and another 4.53% falls within 3 SD. Therefore, we are looking for a variation that includes most of the data, which is 2 SD.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
