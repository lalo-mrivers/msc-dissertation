["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the primary role of T-lymphocytes. Upon reviewing the relevant documents, we see that one document discusses 'Roles of multiple accessory molecules in T-cell activation' which implies T-cells are involved in activation and signaling. Another document talks about 'T-cell-mediated activation of B cells' which shows T-cells can activate other immune cells. A third document discusses 'The role of T lymphocytes in the pathogenesis of asthma' where T-cells are mentioned as influencing inflammatory effector cells. None of these documents mention antibody production, complement system or immediate hypersensitivity. Therefore, we can infer that T-lymphocytes play a primary role in B: Production of lymphokines and delayed hypersensitivity.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
