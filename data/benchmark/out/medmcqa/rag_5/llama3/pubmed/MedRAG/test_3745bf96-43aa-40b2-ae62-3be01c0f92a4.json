["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the patient's symptoms (spontaneous abortion and secondary amenorrhea since then), and FSH level of 6 IU/mL, I think step by step. The patient's FSH level is higher than normal, which suggests that the cause of amenorrhea is not pituitary failure (since pituitary failure would lead to low or absent FSH levels). Additionally, the patient has secondary amenorrhea, which rules out uterine synechiae as a cause. Considering the patient's history of spontaneous abortion and subsequent amenorrhea, I think that the most likely cause is an underlying ovarian issue. Specifically, resistant ovary syndrome (as described in the second document) comes to mind, where the ovaries contain many primary follicles, leading to high FSH levels.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
