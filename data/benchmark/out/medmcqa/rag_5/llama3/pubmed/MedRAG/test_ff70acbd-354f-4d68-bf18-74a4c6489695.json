["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, we need to calculate the standard bicarbonate (HCO3-). We can use the following formula: HCO3- = 0.03 × weight (kg) + initial buffer base - base excess. Given the patient's pH and pCO2 values, we can calculate the initial buffer base as follows: Initial Buffer Base = (pCO2 × 0.02) + (0.1 × pH). Substituting the values, we get: Initial Buffer Base = (30 mm Hg × 0.02) + (0.1 × 6.96) = 0.6 mEq/L. Now, we can calculate the standard bicarbonate: HCO3- = 0.03 × 75 kg + 0.6 - base excess. Since we are given the actual HCO3- value as 6 mEq/L, we can set up an equation to solve for base excess: 6 = 0.03 × 75 kg + 0.6 - base excess. Rearranging the equation, we get: base excess = 7.8 mEq/L. Finally, we can calculate the base deficit as the difference between the base excess and the normal base excess (24 mEq/L at pH 7.4): Base Deficit = 7.8 - 24 = 11.2 mEq/L.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
