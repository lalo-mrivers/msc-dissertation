["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about enzymes involved in gluconeogenesis. According to the documents provided, pyruvate carboxylase (mentioned in 'Gluconeogenesis from methylglyoxal in isolated murine hepatocytes') and PEP carboxykinase (mentioned in 'Metabolic intermediates as potential regulators of glucose-6-phosphatase' and 'Studies on gluconeogenesis and stimulation of glycogen and protein synthesis in isolated hepatocytes in alloxan diabetic, normal fed and fasted animals') are both involved in gluconeogenesis. Pyruvate kinase is an enzyme involved in glycolysis, not gluconeogenesis (mentioned in 'Gluconeogenesis from methylglyoxal in isolated murine hepatocytes'). Glucose-6-phosphatase is also not directly involved in gluconeogenesis, as it is mentioned in the context of glucose production being directed away from glucose formation and towards glycogen synthesis and glycolysis.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
