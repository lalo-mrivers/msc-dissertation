["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about histopathologically rosettes being seen in. I will analyze the given documents to identify the mention of rosettes. In the 'Pathology of preinvasive and excellent-prognosis cancers' document, it does not mention rosettes. Similarly, in the 'Immunohistological approach to tumor diagnosis' document, there is no mention of rosettes either. However, in the 'Fine needle aspiration cytology of primary soft tissue tumors' document, I found a section discussing the morphologic analysis of different types of tumors. Among these, one type mentioned is pleomorphic cells, which can be related to neuroectodermal tumors like PNET (Primitive Neuroectodermal Tumors). PNETs are known to exhibit rosettes histopathologically.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
