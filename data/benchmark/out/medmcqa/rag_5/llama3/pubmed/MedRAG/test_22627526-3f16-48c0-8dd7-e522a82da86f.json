["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks which hormones are under inhibitory control of the hypothalamus. The relevant information can be found in the document 'Physiology of growth hormone secretion and action'. It states that growth hormone (GH) secretion is dependent on the dual regulation exerted by GH-releasing hormone and somatostatin, suggesting that GH is under the control of the hypothalamus. Additionally, the document 'Stimulation by growth hormone of somatostatin release from the rat hypothalamus in vitro' shows that GH can stimulate somatostatin release from the hypothalamus, providing further evidence for the inhibitory control of the hypothalamus on GH secretion.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
