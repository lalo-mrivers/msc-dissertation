["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking which type of glomerulonephritis does NOT have nephrotic syndrome. From the given documents, we can see that Minimal Change Disease (MCD) has been reported to cause nephrotic syndrome with minimal glomerular pathology. Post-infectious Glomerulonephritis (PIGN) is characterized by acute post-streptococcal nephritis and not typically associated with nephrotic syndrome. Focal Segmental Glomerulonephritis (FSGS) can cause nephrotic syndrome in some cases, but it's not the only type of glomerulonephritis that does so. Membranoproliferative Glomerulonephritis (MPGN) is a type of glomerulonephritis that can cause nephrotic syndrome. Therefore, MCD is the only type of glomerulonephritis that has been specifically reported to cause nephrotic syndrome.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
