["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for the number of pregnant women registered in a sub-center. The given information is the crude birth rate, which is 20 per thousand per year. To find the total number of pregnancies, we need to multiply the crude birth rate with the population of the area. However, there is no direct mention of the population. But this problem requires a definite answer. So, let's consider an example of a sub-center having a population of 1000 (assuming it can be any number). Then, the total number of pregnancies would be 20 per thousand * 1000 = 20,000. This means there were 20,000 pregnant women registered in this sub-center.\", \"answer_choice\": D}"]
