["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, we need to calculate the concentration gradient for this negative ion. The extracellular concentration is 100 mmol/L and the intracellular concentration is 10 mmol/L. To find the Nernst potential, we use the formula: EN = (RT/F) * ln([X]o/[Xi]), where R is the gas constant, T is the temperature in Kelvin, F is the Faraday's constant, [X]o is the extracellular concentration, and [Xi] is the intracellular concentration. Plugging in the values, we get: EN = (8.314 J/mol*K * 310 K / 96,487 C/mol) * ln(100 mmol/L / 10 mmol/L). Simplifying the calculation, we get: EN = -61 mV.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
