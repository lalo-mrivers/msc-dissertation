["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the Transplantation of Human Organs Act, which mentions brainstem death. The relevant document that discusses this is 'The donation and transplantation of kidneys: should the law be changed?' by Ian Kennedy. According to this document, there is no specific mention of doctors authorized to declare brainstem death. However, we can look at other documents for clues. In 'Caveat prosector: the pathologist and autopsy law', it is mentioned that most autopsies are performed in hospitals and are governed by the common law as locally modified. This suggests that the authority to declare brainstem death may lie with the treating physician or a specialist like a neurosurgeon, rather than just any RMP (Registered Medical Practitioner). Therefore, we can infer that not all doctors may be authorized to declare brainstem death.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
