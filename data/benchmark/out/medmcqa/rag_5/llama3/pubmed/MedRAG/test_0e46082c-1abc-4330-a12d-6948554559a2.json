["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the cells that will proliferate from top to bottom of villi. In the provided documents, it can be seen that Villus growth during this period (first week of postnatal life) is largely responsible for the slow rate of cellular renewal seen to take place. Cells produced in the crypts of newborn pig ileum migrate onto villi during development. There is little or no corresponding loss of cells from villus tips during the first week of postnatal life. This information suggests that the cells that will proliferate from top to bottom of villi are those found in the crypts, not at the tip.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
