["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for a G2 phase blocker. From the provided documents, we can see that camptothecin causes arrest at G2 phase. Camptothecin works by damaging DNA through the formation of reversible topoisomerase I-DNA cleavable complexes. This requires active DNA synthesis. Therefore, etoposide is not a G2 phase blocker because it inhibits topoisomerase II which affects S and G2 phases equally. Topotecan also affects both S and G2 phases by inhibiting topoisomerase I. Paclitaxel arrests cells in mitosis but does not specifically block G2 phase. Daunorubicin is an intercalating agent that can cause cell cycle arrest at different stages including G2. Therefore, the correct answer is etoposide.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
