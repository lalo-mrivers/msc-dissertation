["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the documents provided, we can see that sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) plays a crucial role in regulating the levels of various steroid hormones. SHBG binds to receptor sites on plasma membranes with slow kinetics and is inhibited by occupation of its steroid-binding site. This inhibition is not related to the biological activity of the steroid. The document 'Sex hormone-binding globulin: anatomy and physiology of a new regulatory system' explains that unliganded SHBG can bind to its receptor on intact cells, and an appropriate steroid hormone then introduced, adenylate cyclase is activated and intracellular cAMP increases. This function is specific for steroids with biological activity. Therefore, we need to identify the hormone that will be affected most after a change in SHBG.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
