["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about indicators of difficult mask ventilation. The provided documents are unrelated to anesthesia or surgery, so we need to look for information that might be relevant. After examining the texts, I found a study on postoperative patients in the immediate postoperative period (Observations on 10,000 patients in the immediate postoperative period.). This study provides some information about patient recovery after anesthesia, which is related to mask ventilation. However, none of the provided choices directly relate to this topic. Therefore, we need to make an educated guess based on general knowledge.

On the other hand, old age and snoring do not directly affect mask ventilation difficulty.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
