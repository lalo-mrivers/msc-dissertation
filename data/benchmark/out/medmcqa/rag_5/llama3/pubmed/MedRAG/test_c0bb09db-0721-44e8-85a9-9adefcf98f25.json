["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks which nerve supplies the ear lobule. The facial nerve is not likely to supply the ear lobule as it controls muscles of facial expression. Among the given options, the auricular branch of the vagus nerve (Auriculotemporal nerve) is known to supply the posterior part of the ear and mastoid area, but its exact distribution is unclear. The Greater auricular nerve (A) supplies the skin over the ear and face including the ear lobule. The Lesser occipital nerve (B) does not have any direct relation with the ear lobule. Therefore, the facial nerve (C) and the Auriculotemporal nerve (D) can be eliminated as options.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
