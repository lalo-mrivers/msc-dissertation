["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the scenarios where radiographs are of no help in diagnosis. We need to look for relevant documents that mention limitations or difficulties in diagnosing certain conditions using radiographs. In 'The role of various imaging techniques is discussed, emphasizing that recognition of the plain radiographic changes of Paget's disease remains the key to diagnosis in most cases.' we see that plain radiographs are the primary method of diagnosing Paget's disease. However, there might be atypical presentations or unusual modes of presentation where radiographs might not be helpful.
