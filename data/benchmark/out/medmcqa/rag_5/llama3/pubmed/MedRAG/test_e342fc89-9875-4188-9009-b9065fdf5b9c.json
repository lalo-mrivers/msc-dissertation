["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the study of tin dioxide and antimony tetroxide supported vanadium oxide catalysts by solid-state 51V and 1H NMR techniques, we know that V2O5 loadings are investigated. The 51V NMR spectra reveal the existence of two types of vanadia species on the surface of the support: one due to a dispersed vanadia phase at lower vanadia loadings and the other due to a crystalline vanadia phase at higher vanadium content. Since Ti6Al4V is an alloy, it's likely that the alpha phase refers to the titanium in its pure form or alloyed with aluminum. In this case, the stable element is Ti.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C: Ti\""]
