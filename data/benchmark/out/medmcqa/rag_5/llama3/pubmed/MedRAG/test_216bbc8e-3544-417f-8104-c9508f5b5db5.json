["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the March fracture, which is a type of 'slow' fracture. The provided documents suggest that 'slow' fractures occur when there is overload on the middle metatarsals, leading to microfractures and ultimately 'slow' fractures. This information helps narrow down the possible location of the March fracture. Fractures of the tuberosity of the fifth metatarsal are frequent and heal well with conservative treatment, while fractures of the metatarsal shaft distal to the tuberosity heal slowly. Based on this information, it is likely that the 'slow' fracture occurs in the middle metatarsals. Therefore, the involved part of the second metatarsal is likely the Shaft.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
