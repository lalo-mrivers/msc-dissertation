["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents discuss the composition of bone. The first document mentions abnormal non-collagenous proteins in osteogenesis imperfecta. The second document describes an unmineralized layer of organic material on both forming and quiescent surfaces of bones. The third document discusses morphological features of bone in human osteopetrosis, but does not specifically mention the composition of organic material. The fourth document provides information about bone remodeling, mentioning the role of collagen fibres and glycosaminoglycans in the ground substance. Based on this information, it can be inferred that the organic component of bone includes non-collagenous proteins.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
