["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the development of the maxillary arch, primary palate formation, palatal wounds, and pseudotumours of the oropharynx. The question asks about when the palatine process began to fuse. From the Autoradiographic study of macromolecular synthesis in the fusion epithelium of the developing rat primary palate in vitro, we know that changes in macromolecule synthesis occur during the fusion of the facial processes, which resemble those previously reported to occur during secondary palate development. This suggests that the palatine process began to fuse during the formation of the primary and secondary palate.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
