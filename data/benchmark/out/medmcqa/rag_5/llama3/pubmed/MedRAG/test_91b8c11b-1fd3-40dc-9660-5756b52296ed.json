["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the `Q' test. I need to look at the provided documents to find a mention of this test. After reviewing the documents, I found that the `Q' test is actually Fisher's exact test, which is mentioned in the document 'Quick test for comparing two populations with bivariate data'. This test is used to compare two populations when the observations (X, Y) are bivariate and the alternative of interest is that the conditional c.d.f. of Y given X for one population dominates that for the other for every value of X.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
