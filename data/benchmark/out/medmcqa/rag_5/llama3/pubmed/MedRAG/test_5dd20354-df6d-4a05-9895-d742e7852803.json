["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents discuss various forms of hormonal contraception, including intrauterine devices (IUDs) and oral contraceptives. Among these options, Implanon is a subdermal implant that releases etonogestrel, a progestin, over a period of three years. This type of long-acting reversible contraception (LARC) is characterized by its sustained release of hormones. Laparoscopic tubal ligation, on the other hand, is a form of permanent sterilization and not a reversible method. Copper T is an IUD that does not rely on hormonal release and is also considered a reversible method. LNG-IUS stands for levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system, which is another type of hormonal IUD. Based on this information, Implanon is the only reversible LARC option among these choices.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
