["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided, I need to identify the relevant document that discusses thromboembolic episodes. The 'Ischemic venous thrombosis' document mentions thromboembolic episode as a cause of ischemic venous thrombosis. This suggests that it might be related to gait apraxia. However, none of the symptoms or etiological factors mentioned in this document are directly related to gait apraxia.\n\nThe 'Stroke in the young' document discusses various causes of stroke, including thromboembolic episodes. It does not specifically mention gait apraxia, but it provides a broader context for understanding stroke-related gait disturbances.\n\nThe 'Gait disturbances', 'Surgical correction of gait abnormalities following stroke', and 'Assessment of gait disability in hemiplegics' documents provide general information about gait disorders, including those related to stroke. However, they do not specifically address thromboembolic episodes or gait apraxia.\n\nTherefore, I need to rely on my medical knowledge to determine the relationship between thromboembolic episodes and gait apraxia. Based on this, I believe that thromboembolic episodes can involve MCA (middle cerebral artery) due to its role in stroke and gait disturbances.\n\nThe 'Ischemic venous thrombosis' document does not provide direct information about the specific artery involved in thromboembolic episodes affecting gait apraxia. However, it suggests that the major etiological factors for ischemic venous thrombosis of the extremities include neoplastic disease and immobility.\n\nThe 'Stroke in the young' document discusses various causes of stroke, including thromboembolic episodes. It does not specifically mention gait apraxia, but it provides a broader context for understanding stroke-related gait disturbances.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
