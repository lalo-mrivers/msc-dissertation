["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about DNA modification in the context of genomic imprinting. The relevant documents mention epigenetic modifications, which suggests that DNA modification is involved. Upon reviewing the documents, I see that 'parent-of-origin differences' are established through 'epigenetic inheritance from parental germlines'. This implies that some kind of DNA modification occurs during gametogenesis or embryogenesis. Additionally, the document about parental-specific methylation of an imprinted transgene shows that distinctive patterns emerge during germ cell maturation and further modification during embryogenesis. These findings strongly suggest that DNA is modified by methylation.\", \"answer_choice\": B}"]
