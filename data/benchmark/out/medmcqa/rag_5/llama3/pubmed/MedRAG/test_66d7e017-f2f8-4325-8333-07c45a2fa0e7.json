["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the innervation of stretch fibers in striated muscle. The documents provided discuss various aspects of muscle physiology, including muscle spindles and their afferents. Muscle spindles are specialized receptors that detect changes in muscle length. They have stretch-sensitive intrafusal muscle fibers and are innervated by Ia afferent nerve fibers. These Ia fibers are responsible for transmitting the information about muscle length changes to the central nervous system. Gamma motor neurons also innervate these intrafusal muscle fibers, controlling their length and regulating the sensitivity of the muscle spindles. Based on this information, it is clear that stretch fibers in striated muscle are innervated by Ia afferent nerve fibers.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
