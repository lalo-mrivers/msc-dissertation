["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"After reviewing the relevant documents, I found that the formation of the lip is discussed in various sections. Specifically, the embryonic development of the face is described in 'Embryonic development of the head and neck: Part 3, The face'. According to this document, the mandible, maxilla, upper and lower lips, palate, nose, and oral cavity undergo changes during embryonic development. It also discusses various facial clefts, including cleft lip and cleft palate, as well as congenital anomalies affecting the nose and oral cavity.\n\nIn terms of the mesodermal basis of the lateral part of the lip, I found that the maxillary process is responsible for forming this area (Embryonic development of the head and neck: Part 3, The face). This information can be inferred from the description of facial embryology, which includes the development of the mandible, maxilla, upper and lower lips, palate, nose, and oral cavity.\n\nTherefore, based on my analysis, I conclude that the mesodermal basis of lateral part of lip is formed by the Maxillary process.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
