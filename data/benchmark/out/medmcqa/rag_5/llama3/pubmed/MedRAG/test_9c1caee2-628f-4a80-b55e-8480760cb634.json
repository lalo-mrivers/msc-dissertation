["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents discuss the effects of UV irradiation on various organisms such as bacteriophage P22, Epstein-Barr virus, herpes simplex virus, and bacteriophage lambda. The common factor among these studies is that UV irradiation inactivates the respective organisms. This suggests that DNA or nucleic acids are likely to be involved in the process. Furthermore, the presence of a functional DNA recombination system involving the host recA gene is required for the inactivation of the c1 product in bacteriophage P22. This implies that DNA damage caused by UV irradiation may be critical for the sensitization process. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that nucleic acids are the component that sensitizes bacteria and viruses to UV irradiation.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
