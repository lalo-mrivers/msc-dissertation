["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about factors that increase calcium absorption from the gut. We need to analyze the provided documents to find out what is known about the effects of different substances on intestinal calcium absorption. From the document 'The acute effect of sodium cellulose phosphate on intestinal absorption and urinary excretion of calcium in man', we can see that sodium cellulose phosphate decreases 47Ca absorption by 80%. This suggests that substances that bind divalent cations within the GI tract, such as sodium cellulose phosphate, may decrease calcium absorption. Vitamin D is known to increase calcium absorption, as stated in the document 'Calcium entry'. Alkaline pH in the gut is also mentioned as a factor that has been implicated in intestinal calcium absorption, although its exact role is not further discussed. Protein in diet does not seem to be directly related to calcium absorption based on the provided documents.\n\nFrom this analysis, we can conclude that sodium cellulose phosphate decreases calcium absorption, and therefore, it is unlikely to increase calcium absorption from the gut. Vitamin D increases calcium absorption, alkaline pH in the gut may also play a role, and protein in diet does not seem to have a direct impact on intestinal calcium absorption.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
