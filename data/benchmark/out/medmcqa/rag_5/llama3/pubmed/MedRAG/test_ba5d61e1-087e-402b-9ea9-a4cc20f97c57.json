["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents highlight the importance of preserving the vitality of the periodontal ligament (PDL) during transportation and storage of avulsed teeth. In 'Transport and storage of human teeth in vitro for autotransplantation and replantation', a method is described that uses a transport medium and tissue-culture technique to maintain the viability of the cells covering the root. This technique is used to transport and store human teeth long distances, including at very low temperatures. The same article also describes two cases where immediate transplantation and replantation were not possible, but the teeth were stored for several weeks before replantation without loss of vitality. In 'Preserving avulsed teeth for replantation', a study is presented that uses an EPTS (presumably a prefabricated tooth preserving and protecting system) to store avulsed teeth for up to 5 hours, with excellent results. Based on these documents, it appears that the ideal medium would be one that maintains the vitality of the PDL.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
