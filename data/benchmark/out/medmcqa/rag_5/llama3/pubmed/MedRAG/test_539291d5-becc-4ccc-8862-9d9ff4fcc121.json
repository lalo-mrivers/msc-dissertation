["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The clot formed is not stable unless extensive cross-linking occurs. The documents highlight the importance of fibrin clot assembly and crosslinking. Cross-linking can occur through primary or secondary cross-links. According to Effects of dextran on the molecular structure and tensile behaviour of human fibrin, forces of attraction between fibrin molecules cause weak secondary cross-links rather than stronger primary cross-links which are hidden within thicker fibrin chain bundles. Therefore, Factor XIII is involved in the formation of covalent cross-links between fibrin and collagen, as described in Factor XIII, fibrin and collagen.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
