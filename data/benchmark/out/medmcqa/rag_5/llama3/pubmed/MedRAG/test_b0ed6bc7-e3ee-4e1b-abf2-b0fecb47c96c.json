["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question states that antiserum A and antiserum B are added to a blood sample along with Rh +ve factor. No agglutination is seen. This suggests that the blood sample does not react with either antiserum A or antiserum B, which are likely anti-A and anti-B antibodies respectively. The presence of Rh +ve factor indicates that the blood sample is Rh-positive. Given this information, we can deduce that the blood sample is most likely O group (since it does not react with anti-A and anti-B antibodies).\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
