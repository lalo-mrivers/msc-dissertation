["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the given documents, we know that glucose needs to be phosphorylated to activate glycogen synthase. We also know that 6-deoxyglucose and 1,5-anhydroglucitol inactivate phosphorylase without increasing the activation state of glycogen synthase. This suggests that phosphorylation is necessary for glycogen synthesis but not for glycogen degradation. The question asks why glucose-6-phosphate, freshly synthesized during glycogenesis, is not immediately degraded by glucose-6-phosphatase. This implies that there must be a mechanism to regulate the activity of glucose-6-phosphatase during glycogenesis. Given this information and the fact that glucose-6-phosphatase is an enzyme involved in glycogen degradation, it makes sense that glucose-6-phosphatase would not be active during glycogenesis.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
