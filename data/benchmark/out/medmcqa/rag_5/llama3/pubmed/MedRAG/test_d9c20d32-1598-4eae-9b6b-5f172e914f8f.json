["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Upon reviewing the provided documents, I noticed that the majority of the content focuses on connector designs for implanted devices, such as pacemakers, neuroprostheses, and partial dentures. However, none of these documents mention a 'major connector' or its function. The closest reference is to an in-line lead connector for use with implanted neuroprostheses, which provides flexibility and size makes it suitable for implantation in neuromuscular applications. There is no evidence that this connector serves as a major component for connecting parts on one side of the arch with those on the opposite side, nor does it distribute forces across an entire supporting structure or resist flexing and torque.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: All of the above\"\n}"]
