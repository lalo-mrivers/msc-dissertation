["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking when mean and standard deviation can be worked out. The relevant documents describe statistical methods for estimating the mean and standard deviation of a distribution using linear combinations of the order statistics of a censored sample, as well as rejecting outlying values in estimating this mean and standard deviation. This suggests that the data should be on an interval or ratio scale, which is necessary for calculating mean and standard deviation.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
