["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the genes involved in X-Linked SCID. From the provided documents, we can see that X-Linked Immunodeficiencies have been mapped to loci distributed throughout the X chromosome. Specifically, for X-Linked Severe Combined Immunodeficiency (XSCID), it has been determined that the patterns of X chromosome inactivation were determined in 14 females from three unrelated XSCID pedigrees, and all the females were found to be heterozygous for the hypervariable DXS255 locus. This suggests that the genes involved in X-Linked SCID are located on the X chromosome.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
