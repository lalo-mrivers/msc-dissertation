["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about a 29-year-old woman with Down syndrome who wants to know if her next child will also have Down syndrome. Since she already has a 10-year-old boy with Down syndrome, we need to look at the inheritance pattern of trisomy 21. Trisomy 21 can be caused by a translocation or a non-disjunction event during meiosis. In this case, since her age is below 35 years and she already has one child with Down syndrome, it's likely that the cause is a translocation. Therefore, we need to look at the possibility of maternal transmission of trisomy 21. The documents mention cases of maternal transmission of trisomy 21, including a case where the mother had a 2;21 translocation associated with Down's syndrome. This suggests that there may be a family history of trisomy 21. Therefore, to determine if her next child will also have Down syndrome, we need to perform chromosomal analysis on the amniotic fluid samples.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
