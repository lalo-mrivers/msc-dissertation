["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents provided do not directly mention the electrical conductivity speed of A Î± fibres. However, we can infer that it is not among the options given because the conduction velocities mentioned are 62-18 m/s (A alpha/beta) and 7-4 m/s (A delta), but no value is given for A alpha.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
