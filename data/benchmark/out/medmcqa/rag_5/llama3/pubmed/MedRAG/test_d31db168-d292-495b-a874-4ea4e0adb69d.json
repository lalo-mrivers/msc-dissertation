["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the morphology of mandibular molars. The document 'Effects on lower third molars after extraction of second molars' does not provide information about the shape of a lower 2nd molar. However, it describes the results of treating cases with Class II malocclusion with crowding in the lower jaw by extracting lower second molars and performing distal driving of lower first molars. The document 'Oral surgery in general dental practice' does not provide specific information about the shape of impacted lower third molar teeth. However, it emphasizes the importance of pre-operative assessment of impacted lower third molar teeth to ensure that the practitioner comprehends the nature and difficulty of the procedure. The document 'Third molar surgery' discusses advances in diagnosing and treating impacted third molars with special emphasis on periodontal health in the second molar area adjacent to the extraction site. The document 'Bilateral maxillary and mandibular fourth molars. Report of a case' provides information about fourth molars, which are less common than other types of molars. It does not provide information about the shape of lower 2nd molars. Therefore, we need to look for information in the document 'Ectopic eruption of a mandibular first permanent molar: report of an unusual case'. The document describes an unusual case where the patient had a missing mandibular left second premolar and an epithelial cyst and a horizontally impacted mandibular left second permanent molar. It does not provide information about the shape of a lower 2nd molar but provides information about the morphology of molars in general. However, it does describe an unusual case where the patient had an ectopically erupting mandibular first permanent molar which is relevant to this question. Therefore, we can infer that the shape described in this document might be relevant to the shape of a lower 2nd molar. We need to look for information about the morphology of molars in this document. The document describes an unusual case where the patient had an ectopically erupting mandibular first permanent molar and it does provide some information about the morphology of molars. Specifically, it describes an epithelial cyst and a horizontally impacted mandibular left second permanent molar which is unusual. It also mentions that most notable are the unusual findings of a missing mandibular left second premolar. This suggests that the shape of the lower 2nd molar might be distorted or irregular. Therefore, we can infer that the correct answer is B: Distorted ‘+’ shape.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
