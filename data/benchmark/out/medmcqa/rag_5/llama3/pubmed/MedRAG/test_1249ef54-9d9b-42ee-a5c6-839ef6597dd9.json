["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the effectiveness of chlorhexidine (CHX) mouthwash daily use till 2 weeks for streptococcus mutanus. We need to find a document that talks about the duration of CHX mouthwash treatment for this type of bacteria. After reviewing the documents, we found that in the 'Effect of slow-release chlorhexidine mouthguards on the levels of selected salivary bacteria' study, it was mentioned that the mouthguards were worn for an average of 7 hours/night for 7 nights. This shows that the treatment can last up to 2 weeks (7 days * 1 week = 14 days). However, we also found in the 'Reduction of salivary bacteria by pre-procedural rinses with chlorhexidine 0.12%' study that the dual rinses with 0.12% CHX immediately reduced the salivary bacterial load and this reduction persisted for 60 minutes during S&R procedures. Since we are looking for a treatment duration, we can't directly compare this to our question. But it gives us an idea of the persistence of CHX effect.\n\nLooking at the other studies, there's no direct mention of daily use till 2 weeks for streptococcus mutanus. Therefore, we need to rely on the first study mentioned. Since the treatment duration in that study is up to 4 months, but not specifically talking about streptococcus mutanus, it's not directly applicable.\n\nHowever, the second study doesn't mention the specific bacteria either, so it can't be used for this question. The 'Application of chlorhexidine by oral irrigation systems' and 'Influence of contact time and concentration of chlorhexidine varnish on mutans streptococci in interproximal dental plaque' studies are not relevant to our question.\n\nGiven the information above, we can conclude that there's no specific mention of daily use till 2 weeks for streptococcus mutanus. However, based on the 'Effect of slow-release chlorhexidine mouthguards on the levels of selected salivary bacteria' study, we know that CHX treatment can last up to 14 days.\n\nWe need to find a duration range that is closest to our question's time frame (2 weeks). Considering this, option B: 12-14 weeks seems the most plausible answer.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
