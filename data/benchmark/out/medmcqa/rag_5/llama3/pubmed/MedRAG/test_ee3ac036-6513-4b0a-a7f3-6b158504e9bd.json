["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the minimum number of lobes required to form a permanent tooth. Based on the provided documents, regional odontodysplasia was mentioned as diagnosed in a girl aged 6 with lesions of a number of deciduous and permanent teeth in the right lower and upper quadrants. This suggests that there might be some abnormality in the formation of teeth. However, the documents do not provide specific information about the minimum number of lobes required to form a permanent tooth. Nevertheless, we can consider the general anatomy of a tooth. A tooth typically has four lobes: three for the dental pulp and one for the root. Based on this, it is reasonable to assume that at least two lobes are required to form a permanent tooth.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
