["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks for cardiac defects characterized by ductus-dependent blood flow. From the provided documents, we can infer that ductus-dependent congenital heart defects are those where the ductus arteriosus supplies blood to the descending aorta, aortic arch, and coronary vessels. This information is crucial in understanding the hemodynamics of critical aortic stenosis (document 2). Based on this knowledge, we can identify the cardiac defects that require ductus-dependent blood flow. Transposition of great arteries with intact septum does not necessarily require ductus-dependent blood flow.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
