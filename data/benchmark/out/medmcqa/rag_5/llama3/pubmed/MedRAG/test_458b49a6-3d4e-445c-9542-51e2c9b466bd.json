["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the presence of reflexes at birth. From the provided documents, we can see that the stapedial reflex (Stapedial reflex in neonates) and Hering-Breuer inspiratory inhibitory reflex (Effect of premature delivery on the maturation of the Hering-Breuer inspiratory inhibitory reflex in human infants) are not present at birth or appear shortly after. The acoustic reflex (Emerging characteristics of the acoustic reflex in infants) also appears infrequently in newborns and gradually increases as a function of age. Moro's reflex is a well-established reflex present at birth, which is mentioned in the documents. The Landau reflex, Babinski reflex, and Startle reflex are not mentioned in the provided documents, but they are commonly observed in newborns. Therefore, based on the information provided, we can conclude that all of the following reflexes appear at birth except the acoustic reflex.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
