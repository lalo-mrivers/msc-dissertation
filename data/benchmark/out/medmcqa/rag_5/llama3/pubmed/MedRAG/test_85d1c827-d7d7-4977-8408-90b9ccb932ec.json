["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the musculature of the tongue. The [Is there an internal tongue musculature in parrots?] study shows that the tongue has voluntary muscle that runs dorsally to the apex of the tongue. The [Electromyographic activity of intrinsic and extrinsic muscles of the human tongue.] document discusses the paired genioglossus, which is important for maintaining an open air passage to the lungs. This suggests that the tongue has internal musculature. However, none of the documents mention a specific nerve supply for these muscles.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe [Leiomyoma of the tongue: report of case.] and [The tongue flap for reconstruction in a case of MÃ¶bius syndrome.] reports are not relevant to the question of nerve supply.\\r\\n\\r\\nTherefore, we can only eliminate options C and B based on their description as auditory nerve and lingual nerve respectively. The correct answer must be D as it is the only remaining option that refers to a nerve supplying the tongue muscles.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
