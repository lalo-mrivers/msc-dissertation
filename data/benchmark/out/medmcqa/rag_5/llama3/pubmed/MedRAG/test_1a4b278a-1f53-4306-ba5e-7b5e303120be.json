["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has a history of repeated episodes of rheumatic fever and is hypersensitive to penicillin. Therefore, we cannot prescribe Penicillin G (A) or Streptomycin (D). We need to find an alternative antibiotic that the patient can tolerate. Since the patient has had previous episodes of rheumatic fever, there might be a risk of recurrent streptococcal infections. Therefore, we need a drug that can prevent these infections. Sulfisoxazole and Sulfasalazine are both sulfonamides, which have been used to prevent streptococcal infections in patients with a history of rheumatic fever. However, fixed drug eruptions (FDEs) are a known side effect of tetracyclines, including sulfisoxazole. Therefore, we can eliminate Sulfisoxazole (B). Since there is no information about the patient's previous reaction to Sulfasalazine, it cannot be completely ruled out as an option. However, in general, Sulfasalazine is not commonly used to prevent streptococcal infections and is more commonly used for its anti-inflammatory properties. Therefore, we can choose Sulfasalazine (C) as the best option.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"]
