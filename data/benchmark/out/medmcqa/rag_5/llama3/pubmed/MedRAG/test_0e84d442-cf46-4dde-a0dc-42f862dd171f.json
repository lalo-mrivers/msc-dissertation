["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, it is clear that nitrates are discussed as a treatment option for angina pectoris. In the context of acute attacks of angina, nitrates are mentioned to have 'coronary and non-coronary effects' (document 1). This suggests that their primary mechanism of action is related to the coronary circulation. Document 2 specifically mentions sublingual nitrates as an excellent agent for controlling episodic anginal symptoms, which implies a direct effect on the coronary arteries. Document 3 discusses the use of nitrates in variant angina pectoris and mentions their role in preventing anginal attacks by 'fast-acting coronary vasodilators'. Therefore, it can be concluded that the major mechanism of action of nitrates in an acute attack of angina is likely related to coronary vasodilation.\",\n\"answer_choice\": A"]
