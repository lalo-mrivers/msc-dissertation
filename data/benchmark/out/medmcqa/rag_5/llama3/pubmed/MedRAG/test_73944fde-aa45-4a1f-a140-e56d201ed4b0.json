["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about CPR techniques. The first option 'a' states that chest compressions can be given irrespective of rib fracture. This statement contradicts the fact that cardiopulmonary resuscitation should focus on prevention of arrest and prompt restoration of oxygenation and ventilation, heart rate, and systemic perfusion, especially in children where rib fractures are common. Therefore, option 'a' is false.\n\nThe second option 'b' states an adult chest compression : breath ratio of 30 : 2 to 15 : 2 even if a 2nd rescuer is present. This ratio is not supported by any of the provided documents and seems to be incorrect.\n\nThe third option 'c' states that in infants, the ratio changes from 30 : 2 to 15 : 2 when a 2nd rescuer arrives. There is no mention of such a change in the provided documents.\n\nThe fourth option 'd' states that chest compression rates are 100-120/min on adults and 90/min on infants. This information can be found in the study on chest compression rates during cardiopulmonary resuscitation.\n\nTherefore, based on the available information, option D is true.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
