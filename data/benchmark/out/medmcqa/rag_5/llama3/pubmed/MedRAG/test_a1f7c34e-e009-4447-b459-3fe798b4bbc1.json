["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the symptoms caused by a right trochlear nerve palsy. The most relevant information comes from the 'Combined trochlear nerve palsy and internuclear ophthalmoplegia' document, which mentions that a left superior oblique palsy (right trochlear nerve palsy) can cause diplopia on upward gaze. This suggests that option A is correct. Additionally, the 'Fourth nerve paresis and ipsilateral relative afferent pupillary defect without visual sensory disturbance' document mentions that a right trochlear nerve palsy can cause a head tilt towards the opposite side, which supports option B. The other options do not seem to be related to the symptoms caused by a right trochlear nerve palsy.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
