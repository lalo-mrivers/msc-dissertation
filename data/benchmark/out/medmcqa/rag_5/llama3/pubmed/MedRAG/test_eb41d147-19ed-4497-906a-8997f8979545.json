["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the origin of the 3 embryonic germ layers. From the provided documents, we can see that the mesoderm layer was displayed by removal of the endoderm and by fracturing the embryos through mesoderm containing regions. This suggests that the mesoderm and endoderm are derived from a common source. The document 'Establishment and organization of germ layers in the gastrulating mouse embryo' states that concomitant with the establishment of the germ layers, an orderly allocation of prospective fetal tissues to specific parts of the body occurs simultaneously in all three germ layers. This implies that the 3 germ layers are derived from a single source. The 'Cell lineage studies of the origin and differentiation of primary endoderm' document confirms that the primary endoderm cells are derived from the ICM (inner cell mass), which is part of the epiblast.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
