["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the effects of excessive forces within a physiological limit on the periodontal ligament (PDL). The relevant documents discuss occlusal considerations, forces, and moments. In 'Occlusal considerations in periodontal prosthetics', it's stated that one objective is to minimize lateral forces on the teeth, which suggests that excessive forces can have an impact on the PDL. In 'Effects of occlusal instability', horizontal changes are mentioned as being able to be accommodated without damage, but vertical changes can be more damaging. Since excessive forces within a physiological limit are likely to cause vertical changes, this implies that the width of the PDL may decrease.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
