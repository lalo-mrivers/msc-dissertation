["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks which amino acid does not include post-translational modification. Posttranslational covalent modifications of proteins involve the addition of chemical groups to amino acids. The provided documents mention several examples of such modifications, including deamidation of asparaginyl and glutaminyl residues in proteins. Based on this information, it is likely that hydroxy-proline (option C) does not include post-translational modification, as it is already a modified amino acid.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
