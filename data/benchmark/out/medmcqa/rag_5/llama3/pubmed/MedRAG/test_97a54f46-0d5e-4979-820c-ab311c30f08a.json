["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the effect of exercise on end systolic volume (ESV). We need to look for relevant information in the provided documents. Document 1 talks about endurance trained athletes and their left ventricular adaptations. It mentions that during exercise, there is an increase in stroke volume due to increased end-diastolic volume, not because of changes in ESV. This suggests that ESV might remain unchanged or possibly even decrease.\n\nDocument 3 discusses the effectiveness of preload reserve as a determinant of clinical status in patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction. It highlights the importance of preload reserve (LV distension during exercise) and how it relates to clinical status. However, it does not provide information on ESV specifically.\n\nDocument 2 talks about blood pressure response to exercise in normotensives and hypertensives. While it discusses cardiac output and stroke volume changes during exercise, it does not mention ESV directly.\n\nDocument 4 discusses the effects of beta blockade with acebutolol on hypertension, hemodynamics, and fluid volume. It provides information on systemic and regional hemodynamic changes during exercise but does not mention ESV.\n\nFinally, Document 5 explores the effect of adaptation to physical loads on the contractile function and mass of the left ventricle of the heart. It highlights the differences in stroke volume responses between untrained persons and highly trained athletes during increasing physical load. However, it does not provide information on ESV specifically.\n\nConsidering all these documents, we can conclude that ESV might remain unchanged or possibly even decrease during exercise in physiological limits.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C: ESV remain unchanged\"\n}"]
