["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has a history of two kids born with thalassemia major, which is a genetic disorder. The question states that the patient is 18 weeks pregnant, and she's seeking genetic counseling. Based on the information provided in the relevant documents, it appears that prenatal diagnosis for thalassaemia major can be achieved through fetal blood sampling. This is evident from the article 'Antenatal diagnosis of thalassaemia major', which mentions that a presumptive diagnosis was made in four cases and the pregnancy was terminated. It also highlights the importance of improving blood sampling technology.\n\nConsidering this information, I would recommend amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling as possible options for prenatal diagnosis. Both tests involve collecting cells from the fetus (amnion or placenta) that can be used to diagnose genetic disorders like thalassemia major.\", \n\"answer_choice\": \"A/B\"\n}"]
