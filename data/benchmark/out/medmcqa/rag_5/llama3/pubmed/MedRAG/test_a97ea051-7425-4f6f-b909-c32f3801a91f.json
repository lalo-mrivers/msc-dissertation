["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to the provided documents, G-protein coupled receptors interact with G proteins upon ligand binding and activate an effector molecule. The receptor can couple to different effector systems. Potassium channels are one type of effector system that can be activated by certain G-protein coupled receptors. Therefore, we need to identify which option does not act through opening of potassium channels.\\r\\n\\r\\nAmong the given options, only Angiotensin 1 receptor is known to couple with phospholipase C and cause contraction in smooth muscle cells rather than acting on potassium channels.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
