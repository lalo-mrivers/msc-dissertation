["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has a left supraclavicular lymph node biopsy showing acidophilic owl eye nucleoli lying freely in empty spaces. The immunohistocompatibility with CD 15 & CD 30 suggests that the diagnosis is not Lymphocytic predominant Hodgkin's Lymphoma or Large cell lymphoma as they do not typically stain positive for CD 15 and CD 30. Nodular sclerosis Hodgkin's lymphoma may be a possibility but it does not fit the description of acidophilic owl eye nucleoli. Reactive nodular hyperplasia is a benign condition that could fit the description, but it is unlikely to stain positively with CD 15 & CD 30.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
