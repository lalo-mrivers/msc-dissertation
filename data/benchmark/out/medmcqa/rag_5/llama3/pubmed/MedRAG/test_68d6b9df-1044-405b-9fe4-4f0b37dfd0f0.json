["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the charge of an amino acid at physiological pH. From the given documents, we can see that acidic polypeptides can assemble both histones and chromatin in vitro at physiological ionic strength (0.1-0.2 M NaCl/10 mM Tris . HCl, pH 8.0). This suggests that at physiological pH, certain amino acids may have a charge. The documents also mention the energetic contribution of solvent-exposed ion pairs to alpha-helix structure, which implies that certain amino acid side-chains can interact and form charged interactions. Finally, we can look at the amino acid composition of proteins: Selection against the genetic code, where it is mentioned that lysine, arginine, and histidine are discussed as having specific properties. From this information, we can deduce that at physiological pH, certain amino acids may have a positive charge.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C\n}"]
