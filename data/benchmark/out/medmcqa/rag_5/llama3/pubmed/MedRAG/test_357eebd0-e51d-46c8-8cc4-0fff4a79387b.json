["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the best method to assess Eustachian tube function. The relevant documents provide information on various methods used for assessing Eustachian tube function, including tympanometry, pressure-swallow technique, and forced-response technique. According to the document 'Eustachian tube function assessed with tympanometry', tympanometry is one of the methods used but it does not appear to be a reliable clinical tool for measuring Eustachian tube function on ears with intact tympanic membranes. The document 'Airflow through the eustachian tube' suggests that the forced-response technique may be a better method to determine the degree of actual tubal function.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
