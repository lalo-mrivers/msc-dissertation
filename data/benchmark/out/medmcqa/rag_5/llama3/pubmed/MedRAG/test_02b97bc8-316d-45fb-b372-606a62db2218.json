["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks for what is true about Vitamin D metabolism except. I will go through the documents to find information related to Vitamin D metabolism. According to [Vitamin D], it mentions that vitamin D is metabolized into 1alpha,25(OH)2D3, which is the physiologically active metabolite of vitamin D3. This suggests that there is a process of hydroxylation taking place in Vitamin D metabolism.\n\n[Physiological and therapeutic differences between vitamin D, its metabolites and analogues] states that several metabolites and analogues have been prepared, including 1alpha-hydroxyvitamin D3, which has been used successfully in the treatment of various clinical conditions. This suggests that there is a process of 1-alpha hydroxylation taking place in Vitamin D metabolism.\n\n[Current status of vitamin D metabolism] mentions that the biochemist has discovered a beautiful metabolic pathway for Vitamin D, which is probably as yet incomplete. This implies that the metabolic pathway of Vitamin D is not fully understood, but it does mention that there are delays in the diagnosis and treatment of Vitamin D disorders due to lack of specific assays and inadequate supplies of therapeutic metabolites.\n\n[Vitamin D metabolism] provides an overview of the importance of Vitamin D metabolism in the treatment of metabolic bone disease. It mentions that Vitamin D is the precursor of at least one hormone, which carries out functions in calcium and phosphorus metabolism, bringing about mineralization of bone on one hand, and the prevention of hypocalcaemic tetany on the other.\n\n[Immunological properties of vitamin D analogues and metabolites] provides information on the immunological properties of 1alpha,25(OH)2D3, the physiologically active metabolite of Vitamin D3. This suggests that there are immunological aspects to Vitamin D metabolism.\n\nFrom the above analysis, I can conclude that all the given options except one are true about Vitamin D metabolism.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
