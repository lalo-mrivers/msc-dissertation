["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the given documents, I can see that non-parametric tests are mentioned in three different papers. The first paper mentions the Fisher exact test, which is a non-parametric test for comparing two independent binomial proportions. The second paper discusses the Lilliefors test of normality, which is also a non-parametric test. The third paper presents a non-parametric method for testing departures from a uniform seasonal variation in incidence of disease using a Kolmogorov--Smirnov type statistic. None of the other options (A: Pearson correlation, B: ANOVA, D: Student t test) are mentioned as being non-parametric tests. Therefore, the only non-parametric test among the given options is C: Mann whitney test.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
