["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about which tissues are most sensitive to X-ray. Based on the provided documents, there is no direct information that suggests a specific tissue is more sensitive to X-ray. However, we can infer that rare earth phosphors in radiographic screens produce higher radiographic image contrast in the presence of scattered radiation than do calcium tungstate-based screens. This could imply that the intensity of X-ray absorption by different tissues may vary depending on their composition and structure. Since there is no direct evidence to support this inference, we must rely on general knowledge about tissue types and their response to ionizing radiation. Tooth buds and salivary glands are considered radiosensitive due to their rapid cell division and differentiation processes.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
