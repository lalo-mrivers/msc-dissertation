["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about a hormone that stimulates uterus contraction and lets down milk. We can start by looking at the documents provided. In 'Uterine contractility', it states that calcium is the final common mediator of contraction evoked by stimulants, which suggests that oxytocin might be involved as it also plays a role in uterine contraction. Additionally, the same document mentions that many relaxant and contracting drugs can be ascribed to their effects on calcium binding and intracellular availability.\n\nIn 'Oxytocin receptors: triggers for parturition and lactation?', we see that oxytocin receptors are responsible for regulating the response of the target organs to circulating oxytocin, which controls the onset of labor and lactation. This further suggests a role for oxytocin in uterus contraction and milk letdown.\n\nFurthermore, 'The influence of prolactin secretion on human lactation' shows that prolactin has been associated with significant increases in mammary milk production in postpartum women, but it does not mention its effect on uterus contraction.\n\nLastly, 'Hormonal control of mammogenesis and onset of lactation in cows--a review' discusses the roles of estrogen, progesterone, insulin, glucocorticoid, and prolactin in mammogenesis and lactation, but it does not specifically mention oxytocin's role in uterus contraction and milk letdown.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the information provided, oxytocin is likely to be the hormone that stimulates uterus contraction and lets down milk.\", \"answer_choice\": D}"]
