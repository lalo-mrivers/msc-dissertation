["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with sudden severe bilateral loss of vision, which is more pronounced on the right side. Since there is no perception of light, this suggests a significant posterior segment disease. The normal pupillary reflexes and fundus examination suggest that the problem is not in the anterior segment. The fact that she can touch her fingers together with her right eye closed but not with her left eye closed suggests that there may be some visual function remaining in one eye.\n\nGiven these findings, I think of bilateral optic nerve hypoplasia as a possibility, since it can present with normal vision but decreased visual fields. However, the sudden onset and severity of symptoms suggest a more acute process.\n\nThe patient's age and the lack of other systemic complaints make infectious diseases such as CMV retinitis less likely.\n\nGiven the sudden and severe loss of vision, I think that anterior ischemic optic neuropathy is also unlikely, since it typically presents with a more gradual decline in visual acuity.\n\nTherefore, my diagnosis is most likely to be optic neuritis.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
