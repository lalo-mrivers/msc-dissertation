["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The pathway of parasympathetic nerve fibers to cerebral vessels from the otic ganglion in the rat has previously been shown. The exact pathway from the ganglion to the vessels was unknown. The research shows that the fibers leave the ganglion in the lesser superficial petrosal nerve, running on the anterior and medial inner surface of the tympanic bulla to reach the greater superficial petrosal nerve, and deviate via the deep petrosal nerve to the wall of the internal carotid artery. Therefore, preganglionic parasympathetic fibres to the Otic ganglion are carried in the Lesser Petrosal Nerve.\", \"answer_choice\": B}"]
