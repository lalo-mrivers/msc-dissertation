["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the number of dorsal interossei (muscles) present on a particular finger. The provided documents are case reports that describe various conditions affecting the hand and fingers. None of these documents mention the specific condition or anatomy of the dorsal interossei muscles on different fingers. Therefore, we need to rely on general anatomical knowledge. Each finger has four extensor digitorum communis muscles, but only three dorsal interossei muscles (first, second, and third). The little finger has no dorsal interossei muscle. Among the options provided, the ring and middle fingers also do not have a second dorsal interossei muscle. Therefore, the answer must be the Index finger.\", \n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
