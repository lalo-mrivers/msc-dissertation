["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for the additional mechanism of action of tramadol beyond its stimulation of mu opioid receptors. The provided documents discuss various aspects of opioids' mechanisms of action, including their peripheral analgesic effects, modulation of mu, delta, and kappa receptors, and interactions with non-opioid systems. Tramadol's mechanism of action is not explicitly mentioned in the given texts. However, we can infer that tramadol may have a non-opioid mechanism of action as it is described as having peripheral analgesic effects, which are distinct from its central opioid-mediated actions.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A: Serotonin and nor-adrenaline reuptake inhibition\""]
