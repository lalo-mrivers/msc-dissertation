["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents discuss the properties of hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), a glycosylated form of hemoglobin. It is mentioned as an indicator of diabetic control and its measurement can serve as a screening test for uncontrolled diabetes. The biosynthesis of HbA1c is also discussed, indicating that it is formed through the condensation of glucose with the N-terminal amino groups of the beta-chains of Hb A in vivo. This process takes place slowly over the 120-day life-span of the erythrocyte. Patients with shortened erythrocyte life-span due to hemolysis had markedly decreased levels of HbA1c. Immunological techniques were designed for the assay of HbA1c, which provides a basis for quantitative studies. Therefore, it is likely that glycosylated Hb is done for the assessment of diabetic patients.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
