["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the definition of epidemiological surveillance. In the 'Update: surveillance of outbreaks--United States, 1990' document, it mentions a pilot project of surveillance of outbreaks in nine states. This implies that surveillance is being conducted to monitor and track outbreaks. The 'Methodologic principles of epidemiology' document does not explicitly define epidemiological surveillance, but it discusses the principles underlying all uses of the term. In the 'William Farr: founder of modern concepts of surveillance' paper, it is mentioned that William Farr contributed to the development of principles and methods for surveillance in public health. This suggests that surveillance is a method used to track and monitor health events.
