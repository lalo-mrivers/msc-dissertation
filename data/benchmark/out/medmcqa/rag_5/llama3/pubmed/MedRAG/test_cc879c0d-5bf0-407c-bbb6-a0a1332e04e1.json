["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the treatment of high velocity gunshot injury with periosteal denudation & comminuted fracture. From the given documents, we can see that periosteal denudation is mentioned in the article 'Overdesign of external fixation systems' as a complication that requires careful management. Comminuted fractures are also discussed in this article, where it's recommended to avoid sophisticated and overdesigned external fixation systems. This suggests that immediate reconstruction may not be the best approach. On the other hand, delayed primary closure is mentioned in 'Conservative treatment of low velocity gunshot wounds' as a common complication after gunshot injuries. Therefore, a step-by-step approach with initial debridement followed by load-bearing reconstruction plates and grafting in secondary procedure seems more reasonable.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
