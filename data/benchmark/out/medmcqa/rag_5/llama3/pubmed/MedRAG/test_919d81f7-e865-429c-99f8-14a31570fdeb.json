["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The TNM Staging system is a classification system used to stage cancer based on the extent of the primary tumor (T), lymph node involvement (N), and distant metastases (M). It does not have a specific numerical value, but rather categorizes patients into different stages based on their tumor characteristics. Therefore, it cannot be considered an interval scale as there is no inherent zero point or equal intervals between the categories. Similarly, since the categories are distinct and do not imply any specific quantitative measurement, it cannot be considered a ratio scale. The categories also do not have an inherent order or ranking, but rather serve as a classification system to group patients based on their tumor characteristics. Therefore, it can be classified as a nominal scale.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
