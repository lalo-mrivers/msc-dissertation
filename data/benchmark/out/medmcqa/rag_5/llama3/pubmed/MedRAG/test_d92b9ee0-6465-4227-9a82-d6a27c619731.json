["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to the documents, we know that mixed or parotid saliva from caries-free individuals consistently supported better growth of Streptococcus mutans (type c) than that from caries-active individuals. Electrophoretic studies revealed that certain proteins in caries-active salivas were susceptible to microbial attack, but similar proteins in caries-free salivas were refractory. This suggests that the saliva in a caries-free individual may have some properties that make it less conducive to bacterial growth or more resistant to microbial attack. Therefore, we can infer that the buffering capacity of saliva in a caries-free individual is likely high.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
