["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about diabetic mothers. We have to identify the true statement from the options. We can start by analyzing the given documents. The first document states that diabetes mellitus represents a common medical complication of pregnancy, and that care programs emphasizing normalization of maternal glucose levels have resulted in perinatal outcome nearly equivalent to that observed in normal pregnancies. This implies that hyperglycemia is not necessarily an issue for all infants of diabetic mothers. The second document suggests that the incidence of congenital malformations was highest in the group where mothers were on insulin at the time of conception, and that cardiovascular malformations were over-represented. This supports option B. The third document does not provide any information related to this question. The fourth document discusses impaired counterregulatory hormone responses during hypoglycemia in pregnant women with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, but it does not provide any direct evidence for or against the statements provided in the options.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
