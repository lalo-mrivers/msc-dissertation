["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, we can see that multiple myeloma involves the bones of the jaws and oral soft tissues. In particular, radiolucent areas were seen in the maxilla and mandible in one case report (Intraoral corroboration of systemic plasma-cell myeloma). Additionally, orbital involvement by plasmacytoma was reported to be diagnosed using X-rays and computed tomographic scanning (Orbital involvement by plasmacytoma). Given these findings, we can infer that radiographs showing the bones of the jaws are likely to be useful in confirming the diagnosis. The lateral oblique view is a type of radiograph that shows the maxilla and mandible well, making it a good choice for diagnosing multiple myeloma.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"]
