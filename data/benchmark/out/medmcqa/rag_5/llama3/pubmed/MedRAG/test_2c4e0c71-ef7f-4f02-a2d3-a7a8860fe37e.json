["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents highlight the importance of pH value as a prognostic factor. In one study, babies with an initial uncorrected pH value greater than 7.0 survived, while those with a pH value less than 7.0 had a high mortality rate. Another study also emphasizes the significance of pH value in predicting survival. Additionally, preoperative stabilization was achieved for patients with an initial PH value less than 7.2 which may be helpful. These findings suggest that the most important prognostic factor is related to pH value.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C: Timing of surgery\"\n}"]
