["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents mention the maximum dose of plain lignocaine as the subject of debate. The manufacturers recommend 200 mg for 'adults' and clinicians often use up to 500 mg or more. For the infiltration technique of local analgesia, 500 mg is a safe maximum for plain lignocaine. This information does not directly apply to Articaine, but it sets a context for understanding the concept of maximum permissible dose.
