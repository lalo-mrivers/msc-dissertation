["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the process of distraction osteogenesis. It involves lengthening bones through a controlled process of distraction followed by consolidation. Pediatric patients are mentioned in the context of limb lengthening and distraction epiphyseolysis. This suggests that distraction osteogenesis is done in pediatric patients. The type of fixation used during this process affects the outcome, with different techniques like Wagner's and Ilizarov's methods leading to varying degrees of osteogenic reactions. However, there is no mention of any specific effects on rate, rhythm, consolidation time, or fixation time in pediatric patients.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
