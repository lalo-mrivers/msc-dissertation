["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about peg-shaped incisors which taper towards the internal edge. We need to look for conditions that describe peg-shaped incisors or small, tapered incisors. The relevant documents mention congenital syphilis and ankyloepithelioma dysplasia as conditions associated with abnormal tooth shape or size.

Supernumerary teeth are extra teeth that can occur in various shapes and sizes, so they're not typically described as peg-shaped incisors.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C\n}"]
