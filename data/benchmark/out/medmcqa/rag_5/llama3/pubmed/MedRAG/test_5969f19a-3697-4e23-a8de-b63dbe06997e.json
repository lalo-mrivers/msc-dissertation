["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks for the statement that is NOT true. None of the options seem to be directly related to the provided documents.

The text suggests that there is no basis for recommending annual administration of influenza vaccines to so-called high-risk groups and persons over 64 years of age. Although it does not explicitly state that 1-5 years is a high-risk age group, it implies that the recommendation only applies to those over 64 years old. Therefore, Option C could be considered a statement that is NOT true.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
