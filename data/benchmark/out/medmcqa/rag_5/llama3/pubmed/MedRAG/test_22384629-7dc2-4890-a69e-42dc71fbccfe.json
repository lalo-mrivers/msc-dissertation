["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the development of principal fibers in the periodontal ligament (PDL). The initial attachment of principal fibers to the root dentin surface is investigated. The findings suggest that the sheath-like, cellular compartments cause the tight bundling of the principal fibers. This information implies that the principal fibers are made up of collagenous and elastic components, as they are initially embedded in ruthenium red-positive material and later become bundles with a sheath-like structure.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: Collagenous and elastic\"\n}"]
