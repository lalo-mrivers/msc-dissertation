["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the effects of lingually placed mandibular posteriors. The relevant documents discuss various topics such as treatment of chronic mandibular dislocation, techniques for ensuring lateral position of the proximal segment following intraoral vertical ramus osteotomy, and soft-tissue changes related to the surgical management of mandibular prognathism. However, none of these topics specifically mention lingually placed mandibular posteriors. Therefore, we need to look for information related to dental disorders or treatment options that could be relevant to this question.\n\nThe document 'The mandibular posterior fixed partial denture' discusses various technical difficulties and how to overcome them. It does not specifically mention lingually placed mandibular posteriors either.\n\nHowever, the document 'Soft-tissue changes related to the surgical management of mandibular prognathism' mentions soft-tissue points such as chin and lower lip position relative to the underlying mandibular structures. This could be related to dental disorders or treatment options.\n\nThe document 'Mandibular deficiency syndrome. II. Surgical considerations for mandibular advancement' discusses surgical techniques for advancing the mandible, which could also be relevant to this question.\n\nBased on this step-by-step thinking, it seems that the answer must be related to some kind of oral health issue or treatment option. Therefore, we can focus on the potential choices provided: gagging, speech difficulties, excessive pressure on ridge, and tongue interference.\", \n\"answer_choice\": D"]
