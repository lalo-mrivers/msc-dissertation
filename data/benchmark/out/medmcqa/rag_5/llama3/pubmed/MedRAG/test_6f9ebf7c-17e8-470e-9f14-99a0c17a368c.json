["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Periventricular leukomalacia is a type of brain injury that can occur in premature infants. According to the document 'Brain injury in the premature infant--current concepts of pathogenesis and prevention', periventricular leukomalacia complex is a new complex of CNS lesions that has appeared in 54% (50/93) of the brains of premature infant cadavers. This complex consists of necrotizing lesions in the periventricular white matter and in the gray nuclei of the cerebral hemispheres, the hippocampus and subiculum, cerebellar folia and white matter, and basis pontis. The document 'Cerebral palsy: MR findings in 40 patients' states that review of MR scans of 11 patients who had been born prematurely revealed findings of periventricular white matter damage, indicative of hypoxic-ischemic brain injury (82%). This suggests that periventricular leukomalacia can lead to cerebral palsy and its associated sequelae. Since the question is asking about the most common sequelae due to periventricular leukomalacia, we need to look at the common features of cerebral palsy in these patients.\",\n\"answer_choice\": A"]
