["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the first document, it is mentioned that type IV collagen is expressed on the surface of the lamina densa. This information suggests that there might be a connection between the lamina densa and type 4 collagen. The second document does not provide any information about anchoring fibers containing specific types of collagen. However, in the first document, it was mentioned that after trypsinization, the lamina densa was found to be composed of microfilaments approximately 10 nm thick showing beaded appearances. These microfilaments exhibited the same cobblestone-like structures as the lamina densa surface. Observation of the torn lamina densa demonstrated anchoring fibrils and oxytalan fibers that were attached to the lamina densa itself. Therefore, it can be concluded that the anchoring fibers of the lamina densa contain type IV collagen.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
