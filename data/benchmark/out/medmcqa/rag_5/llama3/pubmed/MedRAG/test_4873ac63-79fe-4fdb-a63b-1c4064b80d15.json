["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the provided documents, we can see that iron is taken up into enterocytes through brush-border uptake. This process is mentioned in 'Regional characteristics of intestinal iron absorption in the guinea-pig' and 'Iron binding proteins and influx of iron across the duodenal brush border'. The brush-border membrane vesicles prepared from ileal mucosa demonstrated a higher capacity for iron uptake compared to vesicles of duodenal origin, indicating that enterocytes play a role in iron absorption. Furthermore, the study on lactotransferrin receptors in the human intestine suggests that iron may be transported across the brush border after delivery to specific protein binding sites at the cell surface.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
