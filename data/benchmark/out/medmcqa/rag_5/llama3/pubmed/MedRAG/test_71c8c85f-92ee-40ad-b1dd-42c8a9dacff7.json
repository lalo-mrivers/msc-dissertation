["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"After reviewing the provided documents, I noticed that cardiolipin is mentioned as a specific phospholipid of mitochondria. It is synthesized by an enzyme called cardiolipin synthase, which requires CO2+ for activity and has a pH optimum between 8-9. Cardiolipin is also shown to be involved in the function of biomembranes, particularly in oxidative phosphorylation mechanisms. Additionally, it can bind to proteins such as albumin and participate in the formation of non-lamellar phases.\n\nConsidering these points, I can eliminate option D as cardiolipins do not have a choline base with a labile methyl group. Options A and C are supported by the documents, as cardiolipin is indeed found in the inner mitochondrial membrane and it is also referred to as diphosphatidylglycerol.\n\nBased on this analysis, I can conclude that option B (Play role in process of apoptosis) is not true about cardiolipin.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
