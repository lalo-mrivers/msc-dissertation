["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"None of the provided documents discuss the average number of muscle fibers attached to one Golgi tendon organ. The documents focus on changes in contractile material, ultrastructural evidence of actin in tendon cells, determination of muscle-tendon unit properties, and presynaptic inhibition of muscle spindle and tendon organ afferents in the mammalian spinal cord. Human muscle afferent responses to tendon taps also do not provide information about Golgi tendon organs.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
