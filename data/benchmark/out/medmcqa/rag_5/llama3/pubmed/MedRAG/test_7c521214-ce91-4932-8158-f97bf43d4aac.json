["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks for which statement is not true. I will analyze each option: A talks about Parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTH) causing hypercalcemia in cancer patients, but this is a topic unrelated to the provided documents, so it's likely correct. B mentions plasma calcium levels affecting PTH secretion, which is also a topic not covered by the given texts. C discusses Mg2+ and Ca2+ influencing PTH secretion, again outside the scope of the provided information. D talks about Ca2+ influencing PTH secretion through a receptor in the parathyroid gland, but this is not mentioned in any of the documents. Therefore, I deduce that none of the options are directly related to the given texts.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"None of the above (i.e., A-D)\"\n}"]
