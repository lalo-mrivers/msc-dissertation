["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, we can see that squamous cell carcinomas exhibit changes in carbohydrate expression which is often significantly altered in tumours. This suggests that the acquisition of a malignant phenotype may be related to changes in carbohydrate expression. Additionally, the document 'Tumour progression and the nature of cancer' describes the concept of tumour progression and its relationship with differentiation. It suggests that tumor progression leads to increasing tumor aggression, whereas induction of differentiation causes tumors to evolve to a more benign phenotype. The early acquisition of malignant phenotype may be related to this process.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
