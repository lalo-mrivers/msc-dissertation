["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the maximum contribution to the refractive power of the eye. The relevant documents describe crystalline lens power in myopia, depth-dependent light scattering measurements in normal corneas, and the distribution of dioptric power: ellipsoids of constant probability density. From these documents, we can infer that the crystalline lens plays a significant role in the refractive power of the eye, as shown by the measurement of ocular dimensions and determination of the crystalline lens powers in myopes and emmetropic subjects. Therefore, the maximum contribution to the refractive power of the eye is likely made by the crystalline lens.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
