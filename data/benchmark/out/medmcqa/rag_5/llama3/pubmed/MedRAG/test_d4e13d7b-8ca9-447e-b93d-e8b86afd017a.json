["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the documents provided, we know that gingival recession is discussed as a condition that has an obscure etiology. We also know that gingival recession can be treated directly when complaints and concerns occur. Since Class 1, 2, 3, and 4 are specific classifications of malocclusion or furcation involvement, it's unlikely that the class of recession would be one of those.
