["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about which hormones are under inhibitory control of the hypothalamus. Based on the provided documents, we can see that somatostatin has been shown to inhibit growth hormone releaseinhibiting factor in man, and corticosteroids have been demonstrated to exert a fast feedback mechanism by inhibition of release at the level of the hypothalamus. Additionally, studies have shown that noradrenaline and serotonin participate in the control of ACTH-glucocorticoids secretion. Considering these findings, we can infer that growth hormone is under inhibitory control of the hypothalamus through somatostatin.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D\n}"]
