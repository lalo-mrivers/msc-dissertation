["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about ganglionic transmission. From the provided documents, we can see that slow decreases of ionic conductance across neuronal cell membranes can increase the effectiveness of synaptic transmission by a postsynaptic mechanism. This is specifically mentioned in the document 'Long-lasting synaptic potentials and the modulation of synaptic transmission'. Therefore, we are looking for an option related to postsynaptic receptors.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
