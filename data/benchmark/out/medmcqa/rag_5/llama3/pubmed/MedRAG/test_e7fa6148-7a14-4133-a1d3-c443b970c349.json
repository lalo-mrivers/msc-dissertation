["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the most common chance of pulpal exposure when creating a pulpal floor perpendicular to the long axis of tooth. The documents provided discuss various topics related to pulp capping and root canal therapy, but none of them directly address this specific scenario. However, we can infer that the likelihood of pulpal exposure is higher when the volume of pulp tissue is shallow, as mentioned in the document 'Clinical situations in which amputation is preferred to pulp capping because of biologic considerations'. This implies that a smaller distance between the pulpal floor and the pulp may lead to an increased risk of pulpal exposure. Among the options provided, the maxillary 1st molar has the largest pulp chamber volume, making it more likely for pulpal exposure to occur when creating a pulpal floor perpendicular to its long axis.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
