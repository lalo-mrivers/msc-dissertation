["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to the article 'Rapid intravenous infusion of amphotericin B: a pilot study', it is mentioned that serum potassium levels dropped below the normal limit of 3.5 mEq/L (3.5 mmol/L) in all patients, but no patient had potassium levels below 2.5 mEq/L (2.5 mmol/L). Since the patient has developed hypokalemia with a level of 2.3 meq/l, which is below the normal limit and also below the lowest documented value (2.5 meq/l), it is necessary to provide K+ supplementation.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: 120-160 mEq over 24 hours\"\n}"]
