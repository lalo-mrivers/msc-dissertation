["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the type of enzyme that catalyses the transfer of a molecule group from one molecule to another. The relevant documents provide information on enzymes and their mechanisms. The first document describes kinetic consequences of slow substrate binding, which is not directly related to the current question. The second document discusses the structural components that lead to enzyme function, but it does not specifically address the type of enzyme involved in a group transfer reaction. The third document mentions metabolic activation of carcinogens, including oxidation and reduction reactions, but this information is not relevant to the current question. The fourth document describes deuterium and tritium exchange in enzyme kinetics, which provides some general information about enzymes, but it does not provide specific details about the type of enzyme involved in a group transfer reaction.\n\nThe only relevant information that can be used to answer the question is from the first sentence of the second document: 'To build an enzyme.... The structural components that lead to enzyme function are discussed for one simple enzyme-catalysed reaction: that mediated by triosephosphate isomerase.' This suggests that the type of enzyme involved in a group transfer reaction is likely to be a transferase, which is defined as an enzyme that catalyses the transfer of a molecule group from one molecule to another.\n\nBased on this information, the answer is C: Transferases.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
