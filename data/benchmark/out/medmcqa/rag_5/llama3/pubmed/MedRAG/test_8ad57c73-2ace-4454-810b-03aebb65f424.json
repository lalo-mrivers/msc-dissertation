["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the process of alloxan-induced cell damage, which involves the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) including superoxide anions, hydroxyl radicals, and hydrogen peroxide. The ROS are formed through the interaction between alloxan and cellular components such as plasma membranes and lysosomes. The study found that early events in the process include rapid lysosomal membrane damage and disappearance of the proton gradient, followed by plasma membrane alterations and increased leakage of fluorescein. Later events include mitochondrial damage and cellular degeneration. The study also found that pretreatment with desferrioxamine (Des) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) or Des, SOD, and catalase (CAT) resulted in partial or almost full protection against alloxan-induced cell damage.\n\nThe documents also describe the process of phagocytosis by lipopolysaccharide-primed human neutrophils, which involves the extracellular release of reactive oxygen metabolites. The study found that priming human neutrophils with lipopolysaccharide resulted in a significant increase in respiratory burst activity and extracellular release of reactive oxygen metabolites.\n\nFinally, the documents describe the process of phagocyte chemiluminescence, which is a measure of the photon emission of phagocytes during stress and disease. The study found that activated macrophages have a markedly increased capacity to generate superoxide anion (O2) and H2O2 in vitro when stimulated by phagocytosis or surface perturbation.\n\nBased on this information, it appears that reactive oxygen metabolites are released from lysosomes through the interaction between alloxan and cellular components such as plasma membranes and lysosomes.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
