["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The primary site of action of antidiuretic hormone is on the collecting ducts and principal cells of the distal convoluted tubule. This can be inferred from the fact that angiotensin II stimulates ADH release in vitro by a direct action in the central nervous system, specifically at the level of the hypothalamus (Localization of central sites of action of angiotensin II on ADH release in vitro). Additionally, the effect of antidiuretic hormone on sodium excretion and diuresis is reduced tubular reabsorption, which occurs primarily in the distal convoluted tubule and collecting ducts (Mechanism of action of neurohypophyseal hormones on sodium excretion and diuresis).\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
