["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for true statements about osteoblasts that are all except one. From the provided documents, we know that osteoblasts originate from osteoprogenitor cells (Concepts of osteoblast growth and differentiation: basis for modulation of bone cell development and tissue formation). We also know that they have a plasma membrane showing multiple folds (Ultrastructure of bone-tissue cells). Additionally, it is mentioned in Bone diseases in advanced and old age: diagnostics, prophylaxis, therapy that osteoblasts are regulated by biochemical markers (BM P), which suggests hormonal regulation rather than direct BM regulation. Finally, there is no mention of neuropeptide receptors in the provided documents. Therefore, option D is the correct answer.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
