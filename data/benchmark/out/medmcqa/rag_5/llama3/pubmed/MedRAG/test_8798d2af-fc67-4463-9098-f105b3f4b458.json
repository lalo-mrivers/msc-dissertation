["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant document is 'Production of alginate beads by emulsification/internal gelation.' The methodology section describes the process of forming alginate beads via internal gelation of an alginate solution emulsified within vegetable oil. Gelation is initiated by adding an oil-soluble acid, which reduces the pH of the alginate solution and releases soluble Ca2+ from the citrate complex. This procedure forms smooth, spherical, micron-sized beads with a mean diameter ranging from 200 to 1000 microns, controlled by reactor impeller design and rotational speed. The technique has potential for large-scale and continuous applications in immobilization.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
