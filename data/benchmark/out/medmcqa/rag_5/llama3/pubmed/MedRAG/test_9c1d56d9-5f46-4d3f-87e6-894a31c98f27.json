["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, particularly [The registration of the retrusive closing phase and its effect on the mandible], it is clear that retraction of the protruded mandible is a movement that involves changes in width of the mandible. This movement is also described in [A mathematical model of mandibular protrusion] as mandibular rotation during protrusion, which is affected by various factors such as incisor and condylar guidances, initial mandibular angulation, mandibular size, and the extent of excursion. Therefore, to retract the protruded mandible, one would need to consider these factors and use muscles that control this movement.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
