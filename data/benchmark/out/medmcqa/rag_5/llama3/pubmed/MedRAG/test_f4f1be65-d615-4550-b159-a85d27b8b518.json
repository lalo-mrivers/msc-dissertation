["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Saliva is formed in the salivary glands. As it passes from the gland to the duct orifices, it undergoes numerous ion exchanges. This suggests that there will be an exchange of ions between the saliva and surrounding fluids. Comparing this with plasma, which has a certain concentration of ions, we can infer that the ion composition in saliva is different from plasma. The text also mentions that salivary composition is affected by both autonomic and hormonal stimuli, which may influence the ion exchange process. Therefore, it can be concluded that the saliva becomes hypotonic compared to plasma.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
