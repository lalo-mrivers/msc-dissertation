["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the binding of IgE molecules with basophil granulocytes and mast cells through their Fc portion, which sensitizes these cells for reaginic hypersensitivity reactions. The question asks about a type of immediately occurring reaction in which antigens combine with antibodies already attached to the surface of mast cells and basophils. This process is described as bridging of cell-bound IgE molecules by antigen, which activates enzymatic sequences and leads to degranulation.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
