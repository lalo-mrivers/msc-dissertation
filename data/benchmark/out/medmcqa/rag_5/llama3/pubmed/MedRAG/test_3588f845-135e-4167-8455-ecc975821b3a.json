["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the radiopacity that frequently obliterate the root apices of maxillary molars. Let's analyze the given documents. The first document talks about a study on roots in extraction sites and does not mention anything specific to maxillary molars. The second document discusses apicectomy, which is not relevant to this question. The third document investigates the incidence of multiple roots and canals in mandibular premolars, but it does not provide any information about maxillary molars. The fourth document provides some general information about endodontic morphology, but it does not specifically address the radiopacity that obliterate root apices of maxillary molars.\n\nThe only document that seems to be relevant is the last one, which describes an unusual radiopaque lesion called a rhinolith. However, this lesion appears on panoramic radiograph and its location gave the appearance of being within the maxillary sinus. This suggests that the maxillary sinus could be the source of the radiopacity. The other options do not seem to fit with what is described in this document.\", \n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
