["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks what etching of dentin does NOT include. The provided documents describe the effects of acid etching on dentin. According to 'Total etch--the rational dentin bonding protocol', phosphoric acid etching is a rational protocol for modern adhesive resins, implying that etching is a process involved in dentin preparation. In 'Phosphoric acid penetration during direct bonding', it is stated that acid etching does not penetrate the dentinoenamel junction, but it can reach depths of more than 10 mu into the enamel surface.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
