["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the lateral spread of dental caries. In the provided documents, it is mentioned that stages in the dissolution of human enamel crystals were studied by high resolution transmission electron microscopy. The document 'Stages in the dissolution of human enamel crystals in dental caries' specifically describes two mechanisms by which the dissolution spreads laterally to the (100) faces of the crystal. One mechanism involves destruction developing parallel to (120) planes and borders limited by (100) planes, while the other mechanism involves development of lateral side lesions parallel to (100) planes. This suggests that the lateral spread of dental caries is facilitated by the (100) planes.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
