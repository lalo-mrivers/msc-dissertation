["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about a specific sign seen in certain conditions. The relevant documents provided are about diagnostic signs, radiological signs, and clinical signs. The document 'Abdominal-wall tenderness: A useful sign in the acute abdomen' seems to be the most relevant as it talks about a sign (abdominal-wall tenderness) and its correlation with intra-abdominal causes. According to this document, 23 out of 24 patients with positive abdominal-wall tenderness had no detectable intra-abdominal cause.
