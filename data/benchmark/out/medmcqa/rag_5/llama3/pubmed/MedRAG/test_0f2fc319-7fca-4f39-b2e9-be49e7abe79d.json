["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents discuss various cytokines with pleiotropic properties. Two of these mediators are tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) and Interleukin 1 alpha and beta (IL-1). Among the chemotactic cytokines mentioned is 'IL-8', a neutrophil-selective attractant, whereas another one called 'monocyte chemotactic protein 1 (MCP-1)' is a monocyte-selective chemotaxin. None of these descriptions match IL-6 or TNF, but the text does mention that large amounts of IL-8 have been detected in scales of psoriatic lesions, which may be important in explaining predominant neutrophil infiltration in psoriatic lesions.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
