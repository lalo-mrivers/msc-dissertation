["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided in 'Relationship of serum and myocardial digoxin concentration to electrocardiographic estimation of digoxin intoxication', we can see that there is an overlap in the patient groups, indicating that high mean serum and tissue digoxin levels do not always correlate with toxicity. Additionally, from 'Interpreting digoxin concentrations', it is emphasized that clinical assessment is crucial in determining dose and interpreting concentrations, which suggests that early toxicity may not necessarily be correlated with serum levels. Furthermore, 'Electrocardiograms of digitalis intoxication. Reevaluation' indicates that non-specific vision changes can occur during digoxin toxicity.\n\nTherefore, the true statements about digoxin toxicity are:\n- The earliest manifestation of digoxin toxicity are gastrointestinal symptoms: Not mentioned in the provided information.\n- Non-specific vision changes may be noted in digoxin toxicity: True\n- Early toxicity may not correlate with serum levels and Neurological symptoms may occur without corresponding cardiovascular changes: True\n\nTherefore, option C is the correct answer.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
