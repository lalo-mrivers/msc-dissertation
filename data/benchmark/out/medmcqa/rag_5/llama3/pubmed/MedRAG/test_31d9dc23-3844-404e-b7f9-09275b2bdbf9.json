["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks which option is least likely to occur in PDA. We need to review the relevant documents for information about PDA. The first document discusses patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) in African preterm infants, and mentions that 21 (43.7%) infants closed spontaneously before discharge from hospital. This suggests that closure of the ductus can occur without intervention. The second document presents an unusual case of a patient with PDA who survived to the age of 78. This implies that survival is possible for patients with PDA, regardless of their age. The third and fourth documents discuss PDA in the context of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) and its association with fluid administration. These studies do not provide information that would suggest which option is least likely to occur in PDA. Therefore, we need to consider the general characteristics of PDA and the symptoms associated with it.\n\nCO2 washout is a normal process that occurs after birth, as the baby's circulation adjusts to extrauterine life. This process is not unique to PDA. Bounding pulse can be seen in patients with PDA due to the increased blood flow through the ductus. Pulmonary hemorrhage can occur in patients with PDA, especially those who are critically ill or have respiratory distress syndrome.\n\nNecrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a serious condition that can affect premature infants, but it is not typically associated with PDA. In fact, the documents do not mention NEC as a complication of PDA. Therefore, we can conclude that NEC is least likely to occur in PDA.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
