["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents suggest that pulp biology is complex and influenced by various regulatory factors. Symmetrical pulp obliteration can occur due to trauma or systemic diseases. Pulp capping is a treatment option, but it may lead to necrosis if the pulp tissue is shallow. Therefore, it's essential to understand the composition of the pulp proper. According to the documents, pulp capping as a clinical treatment relies on empirical basis. Since we're looking for what the pulp proper contains, we can infer that it does not contain large blood vessels, which would be significant enough to require accurate diagnosis. Similarly, fibroblasts are cell types that play a role in tissue repair and regeneration but are not exclusive to the pulp proper. The remaining options, nerve fibers and all of the above, seem more plausible.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
