["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about delayed hemolytic transfusion reaction. We need to consider the features that are characteristic of this type of reaction. Delayed hemolytic transfusion reactions are typically accompanied by a positive DAT (Direct Antiglobulin Test), spherocytosis, and decreased hemoglobin levels. However, it's unlikely that we would see haemoglobinuria in delayed hemolytic transfusion reactions. The literature suggests that the reaction is usually self-limiting and doesn't cause severe damage to the red blood cells, which makes haemoglobinuria less likely. Based on this information, we can conclude that Delayed hemolytic transfusion involves all except C: Haemoglobinuria.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
