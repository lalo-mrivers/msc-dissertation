["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the cause of brachycephaly. The provided documents discuss various types of skull deformities, including syndromic and nonsyndromic bilateral coronal synostosis. This suggests that brachycephaly might be related to abnormalities in the coronal suture. Furthermore, one of the documents discusses treatment of turribrachycephaly related to bilateral coronal synostosis, which implies a direct link between coronal synostosis and brachycephaly. Therefore, it can be inferred that brachycephaly is due to fusion of the Coronal suture.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
