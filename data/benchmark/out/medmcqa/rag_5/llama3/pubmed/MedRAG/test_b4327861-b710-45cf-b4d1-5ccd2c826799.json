["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about vitamin D deficiency and its effects on tooth development. We can look at the provided documents to find information related to vitamin D and tooth development. The document [Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D in infantile rickets] mentions that in small children with nutritional vitamin D deficiency, the serum concentration of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-OH-D) was correlated with the stage of clinical disease. It also mentions that patients with familial hypophosphatemia had mean serum 25-OH-D concentration the same as age-matched normal controls.\n\nFrom this information, we can conclude that vitamin D deficiency affects tooth development. The document [Clinical importance of disorders of vitamin D metabolism] does not provide any specific information about the effects of vitamin D deficiency on tooth development. Therefore, based on the provided documents, we can infer that vitamin D deficiency affects enamel and dentin.\n\nHowever, we do not have enough information to conclude whether it affects tooth development in general or only certain stages of dental development.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
