["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents mention submandibular salivary ducts. The document 'Surgical treatment of drooling by bilateral parotid duct ligation and submandibular gland resection' discusses the surgical removal of submaxillary glands and parotid duct ligations for drooling. This suggests that submandibular salivary ducts are involved in this context. There is no mention of occlusion in this document, but it does not rule out the possibility either. The other documents do not provide relevant information to answer this question. Therefore, we must consider options A-D carefully. Option C 'Occlusal X-ray' seems most likely as it can visualize the internal structure of the duct and any potential occlusion.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
