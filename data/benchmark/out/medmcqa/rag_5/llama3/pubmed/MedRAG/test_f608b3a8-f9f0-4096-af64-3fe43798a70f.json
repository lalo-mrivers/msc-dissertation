["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents discuss the use of antihypertensive drugs during pregnancy. According to 'Hypertensive drugs in pregnancy', the value of these drugs in pregnancy is unproved. In 'Drugs in pregnancy and lactation', it is mentioned that even though a direct cause-and-effect relationship between certain commonly used drugs and fetal disorders or malformations has been difficult to establish, the principle of avoidance of all but essential medications in pregnancy and in the potentially pregnant has become increasingly important. This implies that not all antihypertensive drugs are safe for use during pregnancy.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe documents also mention other topics such as care of the pregnant asthmatic, identifying drug exposed infants, and drug risks in pregnancy revisited.
