["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient developed a diffuse rash after being started on phenytoin and valproate. The rash disappeared after both drugs were stopped. This suggests that the patient had an allergic reaction to one or both of these medications, possibly carbamazepine (30 out of 50 reactions) or phenobarbital (20 out of 68 reactions) as mentioned in 'Allergic rash due to antiepileptic drugs: clinical features and management'. The study also suggests that the AED should be ceased abruptly with minimal risk of status epilepticus. Therefore, it is likely that the patient will have an allergic reaction again if re-challenged with phenytoin and valproate.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
