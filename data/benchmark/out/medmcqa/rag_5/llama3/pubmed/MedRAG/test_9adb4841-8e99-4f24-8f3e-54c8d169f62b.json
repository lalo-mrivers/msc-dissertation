["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about lesions that affect the marked structure (which refers to the eye), so we need to look for relevant information related to skin conditions or diseases. We can start by reviewing the provided documents: there's no mention of ophthalmological disorders, but we do have descriptions of cutaneous leishmaniasis, lichen planus subtropicus, and sarcoidosis. Sarcoidosis is a systemic disease that can affect various organs, including the eyes. However, it does not specifically mention lesions affecting the eye muscles or structures. We also don't find any information about lichen planus subtropicus causing eye lesions either. Cutaneous leishmaniasis and lichen sclerosus et atrophicus are skin conditions that do not affect the eye in this context. Therefore, we need to look for the answer among the potential choices.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
