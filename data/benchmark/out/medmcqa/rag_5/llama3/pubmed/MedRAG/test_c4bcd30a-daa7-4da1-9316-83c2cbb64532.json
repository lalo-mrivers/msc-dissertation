["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the documents provided, striated skeletal muscle is characterized by the presence of myofibrils which contain thin filaments (actin and tropomyosin) and thick filaments (myosin). Muscular contraction occurs when Ca+2 ions are released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum into the myofibril, where they interact with the troponin of the thin filaments. Therefore, the contractile element is present in the Myofibril.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
