["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to the documents, seminoma is mentioned as a type of testicular tumor. In 'Serum markers in testicular tumors', it is stated that 3 patients with germ cell testicular tumors found to have elevated serum markers had seminoma of the testis and all 3 had elevated beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG). This suggests a correlation between seminoma and HCG. In 'The seminoma decoy: measurement of serum human chorionic gonadotropin in patients with seminoma', it is stated that serum human chorionic gonadotropin levels were positive in 2 of the 20 patients with histologically proved seminoma, which was predictive of non-seminomatous metastasis. This further supports HCG as a tumor marker for seminoma.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
