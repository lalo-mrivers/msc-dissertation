["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the given documents, we can see that dentigerous cysts are often confused with unicystic ameloblastoma. The document 'Unicystic ameloblastoma: a prognostically distinct entity' mentions that in most cases, the lesion mimicked dentigerous cyst. Similarly, the document 'Radiologic features of ameloblastoma in Nigerians' notes that the differential diagnosis of the unilocular lesion is difficult and that the radiographic appearance of adamantinaoma can closely mimic dentigerous cyst. This suggests that radiographs alone may not be sufficient to differentiate between a dentigerous cyst and an ameloblastoma. Therefore, it would require microscopic examination to confirm the diagnosis.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
