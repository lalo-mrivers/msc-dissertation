["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the inorganic component of bone. From the given documents, we can infer that bone mineral is a key component of bone. The document 'Minor elements in bone mineral and their effects on its solubility' describes how the presence of ions such as strontium or fluoride affects the crystalline lattice of apatite phase in bone tissue. This suggests that bone mineral is primarily composed of calcium phosphate, which is also mentioned in the document 'The chemistry of bone mineral'. Therefore, we can conclude that the inorganic component of bone is mainly calcium phosphate.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
