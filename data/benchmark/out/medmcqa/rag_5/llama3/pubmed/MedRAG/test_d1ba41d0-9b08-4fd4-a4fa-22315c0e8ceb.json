["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about myelinated nerve fibers, which are mentioned in the 'Peripheral nerve anatomy and innervation pattern' document. According to this document, myelinated axons have a node of Ranvier, where depolarization occurs only. This information is crucial in understanding the properties of myelinated nerve fibers. Additionally, the 'Physiology of peripheral nerve fibres in relation to their size' document mentions that larger fibers have faster conduction velocity, which contradicts option A.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
