["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents mention that MHC Class II molecules undergo a change in structure upon stable binding of peptide antigen. This suggests that they are expressed by cells that can acquire and present peptides. The documents also describe the assembly and transport of MHC class II molecules, which involves association with an invariant chain and targeting to the endosomal/lysosomal compartment. This implies that MHC Class II proteins are expressed by cells that have the ability to process and present antigens, such as antigen-presenting cells.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
