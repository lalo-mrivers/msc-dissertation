["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe pharmacokinetic concepts such as compartmental distribution, elimination half-life, dosing interval, and rate of absorption. The method of relative drug accumulation discusses the use of a simple method for graphically illustrating time courses of relative drug concentrations and accumulation during multiple dosing. This method is based on the drug amount ratio and requires knowledge of only the elimination half-life and the dosing interval. It involves the use of relative drug concentrations, where a concentration of unity is assigned to the time-averaged concentration at steady state in a reference subject for the dosing regimen(s) being evaluated. The quick estimation of kinetic parameters for a compartment with exponential absorption rate and first-order elimination rate presents two methods: one by direct computation from observed levels of substance in the compartment at times t, 2t, and 3t; and another that uses a numerical table to estimate parameters from the observed peak level, the time of the peak level (or the time when the level rises to half on the peak level), and the time when the level has declined to half of its peak value. Some approximation equations are also given.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
