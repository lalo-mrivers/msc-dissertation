["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the major pattern of accessory canals in mandibular first molar. The provided documents describe various anatomical relationships between the mandibular canal and surrounding structures, including the root apices of posterior teeth. A review of these documents reveals that the most recent study mentions the spatial relationship of the mandibular canal to the posterior teeth in dried human mandibles, which found that the mandibular second premolar and second molar are the most likely teeth to be involved in accidental damage to the mandibular canal during root canal therapy. Another document describes C-shaped canal configurations in mandibular molars, but this does not provide information about accessory canals in mandibular first molars. The remaining documents do not discuss accessory canals at all. Therefore, the most relevant information is from the study on the anatomical relationship of the mandibular canal to its surrounding structures.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
