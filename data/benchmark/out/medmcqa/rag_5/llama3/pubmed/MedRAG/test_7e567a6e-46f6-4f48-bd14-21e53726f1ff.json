["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about replacing one amino acid with another without changing its function. The relevant information can be found in the document 'Rates of protein evolution: a function of amino acid composition.' According to this document, rates of sequence variation depend on whether the constituent amino acids of individual proteins are, over-all, more subject or less subject to evolutionary substitution than normal. This suggests that replacing an amino acid with another one might change its function if it affects the total number of amino acid replacements compatible with preservation of structure. Therefore, none of the options will guarantee that replacing an amino acid will not change its functions.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
