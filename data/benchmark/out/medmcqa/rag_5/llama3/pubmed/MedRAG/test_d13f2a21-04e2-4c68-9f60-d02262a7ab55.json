["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the course of nerves within the mandible. The inferior alveolar nerve (IAN) is mentioned as a large nerve that runs between the mandibular and mental foramina. It sends branches directly to the teeth or contributes to a plexus of nerves. There are no specific mentions of the anterior division of the mandibular nerve in these documents. However, it is known from general anatomy that the mandibular nerve has an anterior division which supplies motor functions to the lower lip. This information can be inferred from the descriptions of facial nerve injury and palsy of the marginal mandibular branch. Therefore, the correct answer would be C: All motor branches.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
