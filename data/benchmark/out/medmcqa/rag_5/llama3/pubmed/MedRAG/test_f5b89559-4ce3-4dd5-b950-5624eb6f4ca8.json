["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents provide information on ovarian cysts during pregnancy. The first document mentions bilateral ovarian cysts in a newborn, but does not specify treatment options for the mother during pregnancy. The second and third documents report cases of ovarian cysts during pregnancy, but do not provide specific guidance on treating ovarian cysts in the first trimester. The fourth document presents a series of 57 cases of ovarian disease during pregnancy, including simple ovarian cysts, which were the most common lesions found. It suggests that progestational agents did not affect the abortion rate after surgery. Based on this information, it seems that there is no strong evidence to support surgical removal in the second trimester or termination of pregnancy and cyst removal. Therefore, observation or removal after delivery seem like plausible options.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
