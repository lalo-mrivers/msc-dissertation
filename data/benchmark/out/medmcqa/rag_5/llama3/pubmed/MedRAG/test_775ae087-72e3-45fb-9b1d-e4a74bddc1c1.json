["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is described as having bleeding gums and joints with hemorrhage into the joints. This is a characteristic symptom of hemophilia. The patient's uncle from both sides also complains of the same problem. Based on this information, it is likely that the patient has a genetic disorder affecting the coagulation pathway. Among the given options, only hemophilia A (factor VIII deficiency) and B (factor IX deficiency) are known to cause bleeding symptoms in joints and mucous membranes.
