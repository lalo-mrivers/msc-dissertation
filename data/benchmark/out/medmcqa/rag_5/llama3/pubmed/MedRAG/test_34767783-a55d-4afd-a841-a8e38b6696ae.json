["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the type of joint that exhibits the greatest movement. Based on the provided documents, we can see that joints are classified into three categories: highly-mobile (highly-), moderately-mobile (moderately-), and stiffly-mobile (stiffly-). According to the morphofunctional basis of joint typology, the degree of relative shift of the connected links determines the mobility of a joint. Amphiarthroses are not mentioned in the documents as a specific type of joint, but diarthroses are described as joints with a preferable movement which exceeds considerably average normal swing. Synarthroses are described as stiffly-mobile joints.\n\nConsidering that diarthroses have the greatest movement, it is likely that the correct answer is B: Diarthroses.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
