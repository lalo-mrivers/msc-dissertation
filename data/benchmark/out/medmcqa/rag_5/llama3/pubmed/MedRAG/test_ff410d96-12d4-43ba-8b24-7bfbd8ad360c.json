["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Enzymes help by lowering the activation energy. Enzymes are biological molecules that speed up chemical reactions by binding to substrates and positioning them in a way that facilitates the reaction. The key point is that enzymes reduce the energy required for a reaction to occur, making it more likely to happen. This is known as the activation energy. By reducing this energy barrier, enzymes increase the rate of the reaction without being consumed or altered in the process.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
