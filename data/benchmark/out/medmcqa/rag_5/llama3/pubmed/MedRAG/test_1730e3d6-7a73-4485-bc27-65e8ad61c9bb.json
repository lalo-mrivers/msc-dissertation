["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe various types of radiography, including intraoral and extraoral methods. Since the question is about an intensifying screen used in extraoral radiograph, we can eliminate options A and D as they are not related to screens. Option D refers to collimation, which is a technique used to reduce radiation exposure by limiting the beam's size. Option A also does not relate to the function of an intensifying screen.\n\nAmong the remaining options, B describes the expected effect of using an intensifying screen: increasing contrast. This makes sense because intensifying screens are designed to amplify the signal from x-rays and produce images with improved visibility.\", \n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
