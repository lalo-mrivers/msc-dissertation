["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the given documents, we know that the distribution of IOP tolerance limit is close to a normal distribution with average = 27.9 mmHg and standard deviation = 3.2 mmHg. Since we want to find the lower limit of the average IOP that can be expected 95% of times, we need to calculate the z-score corresponding to the 5th percentile of the normal distribution. Using a z-table or calculator, we get the z-score as -1.96. Then, we calculate the value of x (IOP) using the formula: x = μ - (z * σ). Here, μ is the average IOP tolerance limit (27.9 mmHg), and σ is the standard deviation (3.2 mmHg). Plugging in the values, we get x ≈ 26.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
