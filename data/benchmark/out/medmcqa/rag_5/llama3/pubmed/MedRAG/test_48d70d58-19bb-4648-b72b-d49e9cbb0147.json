["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe various aspects of periodontitis. Periodontal disease is characterized by lesions causing abnormalities on skeletal scintigraphy. Histologic studies suggest that the inflammatory lesion extends into the alveolar process and elicits a response before crestal resorption or connective tissue attachment loss occurs. The question asks about a common osseous lesion in periodontitis, which is not explicitly mentioned in any of the documents as 'exostosis', 'crater', 'buttressing bone' or 'hemiseptum'. However, considering the histologic studies and the description of x-ray changes in the bone tissue of patients with different forms of periodontitis, a possible osseous lesion that may be common in periodontitis is bone resorption.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
