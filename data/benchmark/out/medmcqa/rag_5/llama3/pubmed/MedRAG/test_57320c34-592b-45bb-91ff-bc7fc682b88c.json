["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The case presents a placenta grade 3 at 35+3 weeks pregnancy with absent end-diastolic flow Doppler. This indicates uteroplacental insufficiency and reduced placental perfusion, which is associated with adverse perinatal outcomes. The study on umbilical artery absent end-diastolic velocity suggests that improvement of the diastolic velocity can occur and is associated with improved pregnancy outcome. However, in this case, the patient has a grade 3 placenta, which implies severe uteroplacental insufficiency. Therefore, termination of the pregnancy after 37 weeks or earlier may be considered to improve perinatal outcomes.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B: Terminate after 37 weeks\"\n}"]
