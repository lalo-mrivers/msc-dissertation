["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks for the smallest mesiodistal diameter. We need to look at the options provided which are deciduous and permanent teeth of different locations. From the given documents, we can see that deciduous tooth size standards for American Blacks provides information on mesiodistal and buccolingual crown diameters of deciduous teeth. Mesiodistal crown dimension of the permanent dentition of American Negroes also provides information on mesiodistal crown dimensions of different types of teeth including maxillary first premolars, mandibular second premolars, etc.\n\nFrom these documents, we can see that deciduous lower central incisor is one of the smallest deciduous teeth. Permanent lower central incisor is also mentioned as being smaller than other permanent teeth in Mesiodistal crown dimension of the permanent dentition of American Negroes. Therefore, considering both deciduous and permanent teeth, deciduous lower central incisor is likely to be the smallest mesiodistal diameter.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
