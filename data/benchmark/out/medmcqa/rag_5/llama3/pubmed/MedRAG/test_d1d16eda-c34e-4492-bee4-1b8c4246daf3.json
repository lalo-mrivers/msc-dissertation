["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the enzyme deficiency that prevents vitamin C synthesis in humans. The relevant documents discuss vitamin C (ascorbic acid) and its role in animals. One document mentions that ascorbic acid is maintained in a useful, reduced state through enzymatic processes. Another document discusses the mechanism of DNA strand breakage by vitamin C and superoxide, which suggests that vitamin C can be oxidized to dehydroascorbate. Finally, the last document discusses false-negative stool occult blood tests caused by ingestion of ascorbic acid. This information indicates that vitamin C can be converted to an inactive form through oxidation. Therefore, the deficiency in question is likely related to the oxidation of vitamin C.\n\nThe documents do not explicitly mention any specific enzyme deficiencies related to vitamin C synthesis. However, one document discusses dehydroascorbate reductase (EC 1.8.5.1), which suggests that there may be an enzyme involved in maintaining ascorbic acid in its reduced state. This leads me to consider the possible enzyme deficiencies that could affect vitamin C synthesis.\n\nUpon reviewing the options, I notice that L-Gulonolactone oxidase is mentioned as an enzyme involved in vitamin C synthesis. The question asks about the enzyme deficiency that prevents vitamin C synthesis, which suggests that L-Gulonolactone oxidase is likely the correct answer.\n\nI will select option C: L-Gulonolactone oxidase as my answer.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
