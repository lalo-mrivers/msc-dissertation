["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the sedatives generally used in dentistry. We have four options: Benzodiazepines, Morphine, NSAID, and Pethidine. Let's look at the provided documents. The first document 'Sedation in dental practice' discusses benzodiazepines being used by general dental practitioners. This suggests that benzodiazepines are indeed used in dentistry. The second document 'Ethyl alcohol by the oral route as a sedative in dentistry' mentions the use of ethyl alcohol (alcohol) as an effective mild sedative drug, but it doesn't mention any other sedatives. There is no information about Morphine, NSAID, or Pethidine being used in dentistry. Therefore, we can conclude that benzodiazepines are generally used in dentistry.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
