["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents discuss various mechanical properties of materials such as shear modulus, rigidity, torsional shear modulus, and stiffness modulus. The documents also mention the elasticity in the presence of diluents, specifically for elastin which displays rubberlike elasticity. Considering these points, it is clear that modulus of elasticity refers to the measure of a material's resistance to deformation under stress.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
