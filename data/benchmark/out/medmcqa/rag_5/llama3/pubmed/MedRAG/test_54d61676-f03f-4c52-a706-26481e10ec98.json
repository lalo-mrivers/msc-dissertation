["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents provided discuss the use of anticonvulsant drugs such as phenytoin. Phenytoin is mentioned specifically in the document 'Anticonvulsant therapy' as one of the preferred drugs for initial therapy of most seizure disorders. Additionally, it is mentioned in the document 'Effectiveness of anticonvulsant therapy in the epilepsies in Nigerian Africans' that phenytoin was used as a single agent and compared to phenobarbital in terms of effectiveness. None of the other documents specifically discuss the side effects of phenytoin. Therefore, it is likely that one of the most common side effects of phenytoin is mentioned in either 'Anticonvulsant therapy' or 'Effectiveness of anticonvulsant therapy in the epilepsies in Nigerian Africans'. The document 'Behavioural effects of anti-epileptic drugs' discusses various types of behavioral disturbance, but does not specifically mention side effects of phenytoin. Similarly, the documents 'Anaesthesia and the epileptic patient' and 'Toxic effects of drugs used in the ICU' discuss potential complications associated with anticonvulsant therapy or anaesthesia for epileptic patients, but do not specifically mention the side effects of phenytoin. Therefore, it is likely that one of the most common side effects of phenytoin is mentioned in either 'Anticonvulsant therapy' or 'Effectiveness of anticonvulsant therapy in the epilepsies in Nigerian Africans'.\",\n\"answer_choice\": A"]
