["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant document for this question is the 'A catheter withdrawing apparatus for clinical urethral pressure profile studies'. The apparatus is used to withdraw a urethral catheter at a constant speed. This indicates that the rotation speed of the instrument is not extremely high or low, but rather moderate. Based on this information, we can eliminate choices B and C, which are extreme values. We are left with options A, D, and E (not available in this case). The most likely value is D, 150-300 RPM, as it falls within the range of a moderate rotation speed.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
