["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the effect of one unit of packed red blood cells (PRBC) on hematocrit (HCT). From the given documents, we can find information about hematology and blood testing. In particular, the document 'Quality control in hematology by means of values from patients' discusses the determination of platelets, white blood cells, red blood cells, hemoglobin, and hematocrit using the Hemalog device. This gives us a good starting point to answer the question.\n\nThe relevant information from this document is that the Hemalog method was used for quality control in hematology, specifically for determining hemoglobin, red blood cells, and hematocrit. This suggests that we can look at how one unit of PRBC affects these values.\n\nFrom another document, 'A method for the independent assessment of the accuracy of hematology whole-blood calibrators', we find that statistical analysis of patient data confirmed the accuracy of the values for hemoglobin, erythrocyte count, hematocrit, and erythrocyte indices. This provides us with a good understanding of how these values are related.\n\nGiven this information, we can assume that one unit of PRBC will increase HCT by 3-5% (C).\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
