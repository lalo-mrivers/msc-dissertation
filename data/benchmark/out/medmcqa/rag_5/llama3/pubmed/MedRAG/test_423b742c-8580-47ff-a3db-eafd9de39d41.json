["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about a child with 10 days abdominal pain who presented to OPD. Stool microscopy was done which showed certain findings. The options are antiparasitic medications. The documents provided mention virus infections contributing to nonspecific abdominal pain in childhood, but do not specify the exact organism causing the disease.
