["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The passage describes the cytopathic effect of various viruses including vaccinia virus, influenza virus, and rubella virus. Inactivated vaccines failed to induce a cytotoxic T-cell response in vivo or sensitize target cells for T cell-mediated lysis in vitro. This suggests that infectious virus is required for the induction of cytotoxic T-cell responses. Similarly, HIV-1-induced cytopathogenicity was demonstrated even when the viral glycoprotein was severely reduced, indicating that other parameters must be involved in inducing cell death. The study on vaccinia virus-specific cytotoxin shows that it is a late gene product and a virion component, suggesting that it may play a role in vaccinia-induced cell degeneration.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
