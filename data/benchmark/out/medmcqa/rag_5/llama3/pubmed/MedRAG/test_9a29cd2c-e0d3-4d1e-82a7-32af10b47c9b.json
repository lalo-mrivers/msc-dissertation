["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the highest concentration of desmosomes. Desmosomes are intercellular junctions involved in adhesion of epithelial cells to each other or to basement membranes. The molecular biology of desmosomes and hemidesmosomes suggests that they are unrelated, but both are characterized by dense cytoplasmic plaques linked to the intermediate filament cytoskeleton of the cells. In the provided documents, we can see that desmosomes are found in epithelial cells, specifically in basal and prickle cells.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
