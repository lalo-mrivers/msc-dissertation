["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the tooth structure most affected by Vit-A deficiency. From the provided documents, we can see that ascorbic acid (Vit-C) deficiency affects odontoblast differentiation and collagen secretion/resorption in mouse incisors. In another document, it is mentioned that chronic Vit-C deficiency leads to disorganization of dental tissues. Considering these findings, it is likely that dentin, which is primarily formed by odontoblasts, would be the most affected tooth structure due to Vit-A deficiency.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
