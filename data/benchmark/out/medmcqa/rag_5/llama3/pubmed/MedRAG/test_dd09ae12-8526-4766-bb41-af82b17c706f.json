["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the biomechanics of facial skeleton article, point (1) states that the mandible is inconsistent with physics as we know today to have this structural arrangement always in tension at the upper surface and compression always at the lower. This implies that the alveolar border experiences a combination of forces. Since the question specifically asks about the force experienced by the alveolar border, I will focus on points (1) and (2). Point (2) states that rigid internal fixation is designed to stabilize the fracture to allow the mandible to work as a nonfractured structure. This means that the plates are placed in such a way that they provide mechanical advantage during functional loading. Considering point (9), stabilization of a fracture requires prevention of translation in all three directions and rotation about all three axes. Plates provide some rotational stability. The best mechanical advantage is obtained during fixation when plates are not placed along the same axis.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
