["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the function of molybdenum in base metal alloys. Based on the provided documents, we can see that molybdenum is involved in the inhibition of the activity of the sulphide oxidase system and formation of thiomolybdate from molybdate and endogenous sulphides (Interaction of molybdenum with other elements and compounds in the organism). This information does not directly relate to its function in base metal alloys. However, we can look at how molybdenum interacts with copper(II)-histidine to form an insoluble complex. This suggests that molybdate may be involved in the formation of complexes with other elements or compounds, possibly affecting corrosion resistance.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
