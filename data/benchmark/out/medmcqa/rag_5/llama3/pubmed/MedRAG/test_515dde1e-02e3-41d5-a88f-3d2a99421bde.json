["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about enamel's capacity for self-repair. According to the documents, enamel is a crystalline formation with diverse properties (Enamel crystal chemistry). Ameloblasts are responsible for forming enamel, but once it's fully formed, these cells are lost (Ameloblasts: secretory and resorptive functions). This suggests that the formative cells are indeed lost once enamel is completely formed. Additionally, the documents do not mention blood vessels or a direct connection with active pulp cells. The organic content of enamel is not directly related to self-repair. Therefore, it's likely that option B is correct.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
