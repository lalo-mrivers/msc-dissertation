["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the lingual cusp of maxillary 2nd premolar in the intercuspal position. The relevant documents describe various aspects of occlusion, but one section that stands out is the 'Application of \\\"cusp writer\\\" findings to practical and theoretical occlusal problems.' This section discusses the correlation between cusp angulation and occlusal determinants, specifically mentioning the influence of incisal guidance on cusp angulation. It also notes that steepening or flattening the lingual contour of upper canine teeth can change the incisal guide angulation, potentially creating interceptive or deflective occlusal contacts. This information suggests that the position of the maxillary 2nd premolar in the intercuspal position is related to the mandibular dentition. By considering this information, we can deduce that the lingual cusp of the maxillary 2nd premolar likely contacts the...\",\n\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
