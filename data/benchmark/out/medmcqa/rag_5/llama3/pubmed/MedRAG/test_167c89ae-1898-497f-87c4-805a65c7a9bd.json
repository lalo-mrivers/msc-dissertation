["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The cusp writer provides graphic evidence that the occlusal determinants which influence configurations are reciprocal. The steepness of the curve of Spee determines the relative cusp height and angulation of one tooth to another, from an anterior to a posterior direction in the dental arch. According to the graphs, the steeper the curve of Spee, the more irregular the cusp height and angulations are with steeper anterior cusps and flatter posterior cusps.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
