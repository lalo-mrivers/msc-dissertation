["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the purpose of plane of orientation. The relevant documents are the studies on visual perception and symmetry detection. One study mentions that people mentally rotate patterns to a vertical orientation before judging their symmetry, which suggests that the 'template' for detecting symmetry may itself be embedded symmetrically in the brain. This implies that the concept of vertical orientation is important in visual processing. Another study demonstrates that perceived orientation of dot patterns in the plane is an invariant characteristic of this kind of visual stimulus, and the position in space of the images is a function of the angle between the lines in the drawing and those in the viewer grating. This indicates that the concept of vertical orientation can be affected by external factors such as head tilt or gravitational coordinates. Therefore, it can be concluded that the purpose of plane of orientation is to provide an arbitrary reference frame for establishing symmetry and facilitating visual processing.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
