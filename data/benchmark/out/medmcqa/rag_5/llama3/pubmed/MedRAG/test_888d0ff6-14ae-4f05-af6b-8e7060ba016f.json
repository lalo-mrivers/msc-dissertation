["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about feedback control mechanisms. Feedback can occur through negative loops (e.g., estradiol inhibiting further secretion of gonadotropins) or positive loops (e.g., estradiol stimulating LH surge). The passage mentions stress activating adrenal cortical and medullary secretion, which promotes lipolysis, but the liberated free fatty acids may actually stimulate the system further through feed-forward. This suggests that some hormones are controlled by feed-forward control. Among the options, cortisol is a product of catabolism and can participate in feedback processes.\", \"answer_choice\": D}"]
