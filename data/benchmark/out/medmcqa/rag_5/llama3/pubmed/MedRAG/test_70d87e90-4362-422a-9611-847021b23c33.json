["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the first enzyme to rise in myocardial infarction. According to the documents provided, CPK (Creatine Phosphokinase) appears to be one of the most useful enzymes employed in the diagnosis of myocardial infarction, as mentioned in the 'Myocardial Enzymes' document. Additionally, it is reported that peak enzyme levels correlated well with the cumulated CK release, thus reflecting the extent of myocardial necrosis, indicating that CPK is an important marker for myocardial infarction.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
