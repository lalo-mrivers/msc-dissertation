["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the propensity of different tools to fracture when made up of the same steel (size 55). The documents provided are mostly related to medical procedures, fractures, and bone repair. The only relevant information that can be applied here is from the 'Physical processes of tableting' document, which discusses the concept of brittle fracture propensity. This suggests that the tendency to fracture depends on the material's ability to relieve stresses by plastic deformation. No other information in the provided documents specifically addresses this topic or provides a direct answer to the question. Therefore, it can be inferred that all options (A-D) are equally likely to fracture based on their respective shapes and steel composition.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
