["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, it can be seen that the rate of dentinal fluid permeability increases as surface area increases and/or as dentin thickness decreases. Additionally, the document 'Dentin permeability: determinants of hydraulic conductance' mentions that acid etching increased the hydraulic conductance of dentin by 32-fold due to removal of surface debris occluding the tubules. However, there is no mention of temperature variation, pressure gradient across dentinal tubule, increase viscosity of dentinal fluid or rate of removal of substances by blood vessels as determinants of dentinal fluid permeability.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
