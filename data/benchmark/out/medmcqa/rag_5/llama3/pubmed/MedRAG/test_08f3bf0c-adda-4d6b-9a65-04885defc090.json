["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about what binds mRNA with the ribosome in prokaryotes. According to the provided documents, we know that specific binding sites for 5 proteins of the Escherichia coli 30S ribosomal subunit have been located within the 16S RNA. Additionally, the documents suggest that certain prokaryotic mRNAs can be translated efficiently in a eukaryotic cell-free system when modified at their 5'-termini with a cap structure. However, this cap structure is not necessary for efficient recognition and initiation by eukaryotic translational components, except for its role in translation initiation. Therefore, we can infer that the Shine Dalgarno sequence likely plays a key role in binding mRNA to the ribosome in prokaryotes, as it is known to be involved in translation initiation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
