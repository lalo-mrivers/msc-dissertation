["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents provide information about the effects of nitroprusside and nitroglycerin on cardiac function. The first document discusses the hemodynamic consequences of afterload reduction in patients with chronic aortic regurgitation. It states that total stroke work index was diminished in all patients, suggesting that afterload reduction may benefit left ventricular failure. The second document emphasizes the importance of right ventricular hemodynamics on left ventricular diastolic pressure-volume relations and notes that downward displacement of diastolic pressure-volume curves occurred after nitroglycerin. The third document reviews approaches to measuring regionally ischemic myocardium and discusses the role of inotropic therapy in patients with acute heart failure or cardiogenic shock. The fourth document studies the influence of reduction of preload and afterload by nitroglycerin on left ventricular diastolic pressure-volume relations and relaxation in man.\n\nBased on this information, it appears that cardiac afterload is influenced by a combination of factors, including mean aerial pressure, left ventricular end-diastolic pressure, and total peripheral resistance. However, the best index to measure cardiac afterload is likely to be total peripheral resistance (D), as it is a more comprehensive measure of cardiac afterload.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
