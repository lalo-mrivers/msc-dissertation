["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the accumulation of a substance in blood due to inhibition of enzymes in the heme biosynthetic pathway. In the provided documents, it is mentioned that lead inhibits globin synthesis and affects heme synthesis. The document 'Effect of lead on globin synthesis in vitro' mentions that lead has an inhibitory effect on globin synthesis and the extent of inhibition is dose-dependent. This suggests that the inhibition of enzymes in the heme biosynthetic pathway leads to accumulation of a substance in blood.\", \"answer_choice\": D}"]
