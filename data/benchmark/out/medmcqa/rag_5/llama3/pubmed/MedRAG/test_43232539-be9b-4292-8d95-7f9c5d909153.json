["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant document is 'Holmium:YAG laser arthroscopy of the temporomandibular joint'. In this article, it talks about a new pulsed midinfrared laser that has become available for use in arthroscopic surgery of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ). This laser is called Ho:YAG. It mentions that the Ho:YAG laser can precisely and rapidly resect cartilaginous tissues with only moderate necrosis, can function in a saline environment, and can be transmitted through conventional optical fibers. Since it is discussing arthroscopy of TMJ and the laser used for adhesion lysis, we can conclude that the correct answer is A: Ho-Yag.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
