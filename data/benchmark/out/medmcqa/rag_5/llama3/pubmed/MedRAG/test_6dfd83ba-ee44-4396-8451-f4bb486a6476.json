["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"After reviewing the provided documents, it seems that there is no direct information about overload of denture base being caused by small or large bases, teeth, etc. However, we can look at related concepts such as prosthetic assessment and tensile failure in denture base materials. The Prosthetic assessment document mentions the importance of removing denture-induced trauma in treating denture hyperplasia. This could be related to overload of denture base. The Tensile failure document discusses the mechanism of fracture in a nickel-base casting alloy, which is relevant to the strength and durability of denture base materials. However, it does not directly address overload.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
