["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents provided describe Bennett's fracture, which is an injury to the thumb. The mechanism of injury appears well defined, but it does not provide information about the Bennett angle. Bennett's fracture is also discussed in another document that presents a new method of conservative treatment, where the thumb is immobilised in moderate adduction rather than radial abduction. This document does not mention the Bennett angle either. A third document discusses the effect of functional appliances on skeletal patterns and mentions Andresen and Fr√§nkel appliances, but it does not relate to the Bennett angle. The fourth document describes the CE angle of normal hips, which is measured by Wiberg's Center-Edge angle (CE angle). This angle is used to classify abnormal hip values in children. Finally, a fifth document discusses the correction of condylar guidance by changing the Bennett angle on the Dentatus articulator. This document provides information about the interrelationship between construction-related inclination of condylar guidance and the Bennett angle with the Dentatus articulator. It suggests that the inclination of condylar guidance be adjusted 1 degree in the opposing direction for every 5 degrees alteration in the Bennett angle, but it does not provide a definition of the Bennett angle. Therefore, we must look at other sources or definitions to answer this question.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
