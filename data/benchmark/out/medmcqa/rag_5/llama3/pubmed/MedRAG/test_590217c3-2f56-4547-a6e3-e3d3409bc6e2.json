["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, cold agglutinin is an antibody capable of erythrocyte agglutination. The type of immunoglobulin associated with cold agglutinins can be inferred from the cases presented. In one case, the antibody was a low-titre (1 in 512) cold anti-i antibody with a wide thermal amplitude, which suggests IgM class. Similarly, another case described a patient with infectious mononucleosis and immune hemolytic anemia mediated by serum IgM anti-i cold agglutinin. Additionally, all cases presented mention the association of cold agglutinins with IgM kappa immunoglobulin class in patients with nonhematologic malignancies. Therefore, it can be concluded that cold agglutinin is an IgM antibody.\", \"answer_choice\": B}"]
