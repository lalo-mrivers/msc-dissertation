["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for the retainer of choice for a posterior abutment with acceptable crown root ratios, average crown length, normal esthetic requirement. The first step is to identify if there are any specific guidelines or recommendations in the provided documents that can help answer this question. Upon reviewing the documents, it appears that the focus is on aesthetics and crown selection, but there is no direct mention of posterior abutments or retainer choice. However, the document 'Surgical considerations for the prosthodontic patient' mentions surgical procedures for aesthetic root coverage, crown lengthening, and ridge augmentation. The document 'Aesthetics in fixed and removable prosthodontics shade selection in metal-ceramics' provides guidelines for achieving ideal esthetics in osseointegrated prostheses.

Therefore, it can be inferred that the answer is not explicitly stated in the provided documents.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
