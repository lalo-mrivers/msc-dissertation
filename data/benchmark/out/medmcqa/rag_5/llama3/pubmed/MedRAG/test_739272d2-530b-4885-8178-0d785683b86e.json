["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the percentage of lactose in human milk. We need to look at the documents provided for relevant information. The first document talks about a double blind study on milk and lactose intolerance. It mentions that Milk A contained no lactose, Milk B had 12.5 g, and Milk C contained 37.5 g of lactose. This gives us an idea of the amount of lactose in different types of milk, but it doesn't directly answer our question.\n\nThe second document talks about lactose intolerance in young children. It mentions that no child was intolerant to 240 ml of milk, which is irrelevant to our question.\n\nThe third document discusses lactose hydrolyzed milk and its effects on blood sugar levels. It provides information on the amount of lactose in different types of milk, but it doesn't directly answer our question.\n\nThe fourth document talks about utilization of a low-lactose milk. It mentions that the low-lactose skim milk contained prehydrolyzed lactose, which is irrelevant to our question.\n\nSince none of the documents provide direct information on the percentage of lactose in human milk, we cannot find an answer based on the provided texts.\", \"answer_choice\": B}"]
