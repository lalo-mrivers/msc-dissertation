["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the carrier base gutta percha. The relevant documents provided are about processing of plastics, transport properties of hydrolyzed polyacrylonitrile, controlled drug release from implantable matrices based on hydrophobic polymers, hydrogels: swelling, drug loading, and release, and bending strength in modeling materials. Upon reviewing the documents, there is no direct mention of carrier base gutta percha or its manufacturing process. However, it is important to note that gutta-percha is a type of natural polymer that can be processed into various forms, including pellets and powders. Therefore, it seems that the carrier size of 40-90 are made by some form of processing technique.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
