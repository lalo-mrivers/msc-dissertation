["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about excision of the submandibular gland. Since the relevant documents are related to salivary glands, we can look for information on procedures involving the submandibular gland. In one of the documents (Tumours of the accessory lobe of the parotid gland), it mentions that an approach through a routine parotidectomy incision is preferred to direct incision over the mass.
