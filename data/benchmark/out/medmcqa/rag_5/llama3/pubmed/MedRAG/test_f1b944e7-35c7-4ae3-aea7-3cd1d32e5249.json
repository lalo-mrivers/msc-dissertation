["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to the document 'Collagen biosynthesis in normal and hypertrophic scars and keloid as a function of the duration of the scar', we can see that there is no specific information about the type of collagen present in healing and granulation tissue. However, we do know that collagen metabolism plays an important role in wound healing, particularly during the granulating phase. In this context, it seems reasonable to consider the possibility that Type III collagen might be involved, given its characteristic involvement in granulation tissue formation and its ability to participate in the early stages of fibrillogenesis.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
