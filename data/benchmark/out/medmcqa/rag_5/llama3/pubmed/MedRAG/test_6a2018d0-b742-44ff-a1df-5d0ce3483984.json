["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, we need to calculate the number of true positives (TP), false positives (FP), true negatives (TN) and false negatives (FN). Based on the given data, TP = 5 (number of patients with meningitis who had a positive test result), TN = 511 (number of patients without meningitis who had a negative test result), FN = 171 (number of patients with meningitis who had a negative test result) and FP = 4 (number of patients without meningitis who had a positive test result). Then, we can calculate the sensitivity as follows: Sensitivity = TP / (TP + FN) = 5 / (5 + 171) = 0.0287 or approximately 2.87%. Next, we need to calculate the specificity by dividing the number of true negatives by the sum of true negatives and false positives: Specificity = TN / (TN + FP) = 511 / (511 + 4) = 0.928 or approximately 92.8%. Finally, we can express our results in percentage terms as Sensitivity 2.87% and Specificity 92.8%.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
