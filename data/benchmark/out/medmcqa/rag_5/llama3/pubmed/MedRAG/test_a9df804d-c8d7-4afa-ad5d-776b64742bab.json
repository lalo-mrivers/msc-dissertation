["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question describes a fracture involving the apical one-third of the root after treatment. This suggests that the tooth has undergone endodontic treatment as vertical root fractures are common complications during and after endodontic treatment (Management of vertical root fracture in endodontically treated teeth). The article on Endodontics or root canal therapy also highlights the importance of understanding the cause and treatment of pulp-involved teeth, which is relevant to this scenario. Given that the tooth has undergone endodontic treatment and has a fracture involving the apical one-third of the root, it's likely that the pulp is involved and may not be vital. The article on Root fractures in permanent anterior teeth with incomplete root formation also suggests that retained pulp vitality was observed in all teeth, but it doesn't specifically address what happens when the fracture involves the apical third of the root after endodontic treatment. Based on this information, it's possible that the tooth may exhibit internal root resorption.\",\n\"answer_choice\": A"]
