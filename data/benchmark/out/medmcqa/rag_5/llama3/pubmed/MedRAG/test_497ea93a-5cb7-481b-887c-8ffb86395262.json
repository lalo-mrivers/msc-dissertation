["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents discuss the histological responses to osseous coagulum-bone blend grafts, periodontal remodeling at the site of grafting, and the formation of new cementum. We can compare the resorption patterns between cementum and bone in different studies. In one study, decalcified autogenous bone induced the least amount of new bone yet observed and helped to induce the formation of functionally oriented connective tissue fibers attached to cementum. This suggests that cementum may have a different resorption pattern compared to bone. Another study on mineralized tissue-formation in periodontal wound healing describes four distinct appearances of mineralized tissues, including new cementum, non-attached bone-like tissue, partly attached bone-like tissue, and ankylosis preceded by root resorption.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
