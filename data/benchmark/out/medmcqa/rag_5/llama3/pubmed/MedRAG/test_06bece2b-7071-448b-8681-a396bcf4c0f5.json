["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about phosphate bonded investment, which implies that we're dealing with a process related to the production of metal castings. The relevant documents don't explicitly mention the formation of molten metal or its interaction with the mold space. However, one document does discuss the biochemistry of phosphorus and its role in metabolism and synthesis, but this doesn't seem directly applicable to the question. Another document mentions phosphate resources, including vast reserves that remain uneconomical to recover, but again this doesn't provide any insight into the properties of phosphate bonded investment. The final two documents discuss immobilization of surface active compounds on polymer supports using a gas discharge process and energy management in healthcare facilities, respectively. These topics don't seem relevant to the question either. Therefore, we need to focus on the chemical significance of phosphorus mentioned in the first document. Phosphorus is always handled as phosphate and all phosphate compounds are thermodynamically unstable in water, which means they can react with other substances including carbon. This leads me to conclude that carbon makes the casting brittle.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
