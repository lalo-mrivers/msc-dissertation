["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the documents provided, a Mandibulectomy Cantor-Curtis class 2 defect is a type of mandibular deficiency syndrome. In 'Mandibular Deficiency Syndrome. II. Surgical Considerations for Mandibular Advancement', it is mentioned that surgeons must consider different factors to achieve successful surgical correction of the deficient mandible, depending on the specific technique used and the severity of the syndrome. A modified sagittal osteotomy is described as a preferred surgical technique to advance the mandible and minimize untoward sequelae. In 'Mandibulectomy without Reconstruction', composite resections are discussed, including primary lateral mandibulectomy, which is mentioned as having satisfactory results functionally and cosmetically. Therefore, considering these documents, a Mandibulectomy Cantor-Curtis class 2 defect is likely related to a deficiency in the mandible.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
