["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about Dengue discharge protocol. There are no relevant documents provided that discuss the protocol. However, I can look for any information related to dengue fever and discharge. According to the first document 'Imported dengue--United States, 1991', there is no mention of a discharge protocol. The second document discusses dengue virus replication in cultures of peripheral blood leukocytes during the course of dengue haemorrhagic fever, but it does not provide any information on discharge protocol. The third and fourth documents discuss different aspects of dengue viruses, such as diagnosis and sequencing, but they do not mention a discharge protocol. Therefore, I will have to rely on general knowledge about dengue fever.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
