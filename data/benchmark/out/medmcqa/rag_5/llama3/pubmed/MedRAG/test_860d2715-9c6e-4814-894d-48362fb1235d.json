["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the events associated with repolarization in excitable cells. From the provided documents, it can be seen that potassium ions have the greatest membrane permeability in the unexcited state and are responsible for generating the resting membrane potential. During anoxia and ischemia, potassium and magnesium are lost by the cell, which may lead to a reduced resting membrane potential. This suggests that K+ efflux is closely associated with repolarization.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"]
