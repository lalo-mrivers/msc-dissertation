["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the provided documents, we can see that ectopic pregnancy is a condition where the embryo implants outside the uterus, often in the fallopian tube. The document 'Ectopic pregnancy, the new gynecological epidemic disease: review of the modern work-up and the nonsurgical treatment option' discusses various aspects of ectopic pregnancy, including its epidemiology and etiology. However, it does not specifically mention the survival rate of ectopic pregnancies in different parts of the fallopian tube.\\n\\nFrom 'Embryonic development in ectopic human pregnancy', we can gather that tubal implantation is associated with a high proportion of severely disorganized embryos. This document also mentions maternal tubal disease as an important factor in the etiology of ectopic pregnancy.\\n\\nThe document 'Torsion of the fallopian tube' does not mention anything about survival rates or the location of ectopic pregnancies.\\n\\nFinally, from 'Primary carcinoma of the Fallopian tube', we can see that the extent of disease at the time of diagnosis is an important factor affecting survival. However, this document does not provide information on the specific location within the fallopian tube where ectopic pregnancy occurs.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
