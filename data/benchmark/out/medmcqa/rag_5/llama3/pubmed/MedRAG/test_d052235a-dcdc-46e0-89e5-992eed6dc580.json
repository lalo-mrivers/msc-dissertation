["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the red blood cells in beta thalassemia. According to the document 'Entrapment of purified alpha-hemoglobin chains in normal erythrocytes as a model for human beta thalassemia', the entrapment of alpha-chains resulted in structural and functional changes similar to those observed in human beta thalassemic erythrocytes, including decreased membrane proteins and reactive thiol groups. The same document also states that the alpha-chain loaded cells exhibited evidence of enhanced oxidant stress. Functionally, entrapment of alpha-chains resulted in the loss of cellular and membrane deformability, an important pathologic characteristic of the beta thalassemic erythrocytes. This information suggests that red blood cells in beta thalassemia are likely microcytic and hypochromic.\", \"answer_choice\": B}"]
