["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the insulin to glucagon ratio. In the provided documents, we can see that glucagon response to hypoglycemia is suppressed by high circulating insulin levels (A high concentration of circulating insulin suppresses the glucagon response to hypoglycemia in normal man). Additionally, in diabetic ketoacidosis, low-dose intramuscular insulin therapy results in a significant and equal fall in both serum glucose and glucagon concentrations. Therefore, we can infer that low insulin to glucagon ratio is seen in all of these except...\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
