["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the effects of sodium bicarbonate administration during cardiopulmonary resuscitation. The studies demonstrate that sodium bicarbonate can prevent severe acidosis, but its use should be limited to situations where there is a preexisting acidosis or inadequate ventilation. Additionally, the repeated administration of bicarbonate has been shown to prevent a severe fall in serum pH. Furthermore, lactic acidosis is often seen during cardiopulmonary resuscitation and buffering agents such as sodium bicarbonate have not been shown to materially affect outcome from this type of acidosis.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: Sodium bicarbonate intravenously\"\n}"]
