["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about removing occlusal pre-maturity. To determine the correct answer, I will consider the documents provided. The first thing that comes to mind is that it might be related to orthodontic treatment or surgical corrections of jaw deformities. In that case, I should look for information about the procedures mentioned in the documents. Specifically, I notice that the document 'Correction of jaw deformities involving simultaneous osteotomy of the mandible and maxilla' talks about cephalometric evaluation and cast model surgery to establish a normal occlusion. This makes me think that the correct answer might be related to checking the occlusion in centric or working side interference. After further consideration, I conclude that checking the occlusion in centric would be the first step.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
