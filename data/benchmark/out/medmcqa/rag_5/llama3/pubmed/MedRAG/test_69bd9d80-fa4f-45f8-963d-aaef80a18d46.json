["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks for complications that are more common in ventouse assisted delivery than forceps. We need to analyze the documents provided. The document 'Vacuum extraction' highlights the use of vacuum extractor and its association with decrease in perinatal mortality. It also mentions certain minor and transitory complications but most serious complications reported are due to misuse or other associated factors.\n\nThe document 'Operative and assisted delivery' does not provide specific information on ventouse assisted delivery, so we cannot rely on it for this question.\n\nThe document 'Forceps delivery as a risk factor in epilepsy' provides information on forceps deliveries. It does not specifically mention complications of ventouse assisted delivery.\n\nHowever, the document 'Neonatal mortality of breech deliveries with and without forceps to the aftercoming head' provides some relevant information. Although it is about forceps, we can infer that forceps are not commonly associated with certain serious complications.\n\nBased on this analysis, we can conclude that ventouse assisted delivery may be more likely to have certain complications compared to forceps.\n\nThe document 'Review of obstetric operative intervention rates' does not provide specific information on ventouse assisted delivery or its complications.\", \n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
