["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents provided describe the characteristics of lathe-cut soft contact lenses. In particular, 'Experience with the lathe cut Bausch & Lomb SOFLENS: Part 1--Clinical study' mentions that some degree of circum-corneal injection was noted with the larger lathe cut design. This suggests that lathe-cut lenses may require more condensing force to fit comfortably. On the other hand, 'Complications associated with spin-cast soft contact lenses' notes that poor centering of the lenses is a common complication. This could be related to the condensing force required for fitting. Overall, it appears that lathe-cut lenses may require different condensing forces compared to spherical alloys.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
