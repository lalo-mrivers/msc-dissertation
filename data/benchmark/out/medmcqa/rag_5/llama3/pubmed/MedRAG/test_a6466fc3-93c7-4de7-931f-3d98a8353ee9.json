["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the best method to detect translocation t(11;22) in Ewing's sarcoma. Since the case report mentions a child with Ewing's sarcoma of the soft tissues, and the relevant documents discuss Ewing's sarcoma, we can look for specific information on this topic. In particular, we are searching for the best method to detect translocation t(11;22) in Ewing's sarcoma. The relevant document is 'Ewing's sarcoma (a review of 195 cases)' which mentions that 'the characteristic chromosomal abnormality in Ewing's sarcoma is a reciprocal translocation between chromosomes 11 and 22, t(11;22)(q24;q12)'. This suggests that the best method to detect this translocation would be FISH, as it is specifically designed for detecting chromosomal abnormalities. PCR could also be used but it might not be as specific in identifying the specific translocation.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
