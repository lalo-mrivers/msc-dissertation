["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the given documents, it is mentioned that bacterial protein toxins can cause cell injury and death. Specifically, Clostridium difficile toxin A and Escherichia coli cytotoxic necrotizing factor 1 are known to exert their cytotoxic action via modification of some cytoskeletal components. This information suggests that these toxins are capable of causing cell death. Diphtheria toxin is also mentioned as being responsible for membrane translocation, which can lead to cell lysis. RTX (repeats in toxin) cytolytic toxins from Gram-negative bacteria create pores in the cell membrane of target cells leading to eventual cell lysis. Therefore, it can be concluded that bacteriocidal toxins are found in bacteria.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B: Zone of infection\""]
