["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about superimposed pre-eclampsia in a pregnant female with chronic hypertension. We need to identify the characteristics that indicate this condition. According to the document 'Natural history of chronic proteinuria complicating pregnancy', it is stated that 'All 21 women who eventually underwent renal biopsy had histologic evidence of renal disease.' This suggests that superimposed pre-eclampsia can be characterized by new onset proteinuria, increased blood pressure, and possibly other changes. In the document 'Chronic hypertension in pregnancy', it is mentioned that patients classified to have high-risk hypertension are at increased risk for significant maternal and perinatal complications. This implies that there may be an increase in systolic BP by 30 mm Hg and diastolic by 15 mm Hg, which could be indicative of superimposed pre-eclampsia.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
