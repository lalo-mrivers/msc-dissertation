["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about muscles spared by complete transection of cranial part of accessory nerve. The relevant documents describe the effects of partial denervation on skeletal muscle fibers and the role of denervated tissues in causing nerve sprouting. However, the question does not seem to be directly related to these topics. Therefore, I will look for information about the muscles that are spared by complete transection of cranial part of accessory nerve. According to the document 'Radical or modified neck dissection: a therapeutic dilemma', the trapezius muscle is affected by loss of the spinal accessory-nerve-sparing operation. This suggests that the trapezius muscle is innervated by the spinal accessory nerve.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
