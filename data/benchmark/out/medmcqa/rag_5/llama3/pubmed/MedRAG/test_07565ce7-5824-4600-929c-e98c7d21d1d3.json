["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about pellicle formation. The relevant documents mention salivary pellicles, which are formed on the surface of dental enamel. According to the document 'Modification by salivary pellicles of in vitro enamel remineralization', the effectiveness of inorganic calcifying solutions to remineralize enamel decreased with saliva pre-treatments conducive to the formation of enamel pellicles. This suggests that the process of forming pellicles is an important step in controlling surface deposition and favoring subsurface precipitation.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
