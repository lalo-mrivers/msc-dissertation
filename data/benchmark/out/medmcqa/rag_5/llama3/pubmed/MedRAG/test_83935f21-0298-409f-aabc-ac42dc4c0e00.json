["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The provided documents discuss various aspects of periodontal pockets. From the Surgical Pocket Therapy document, we can conclude that a residual defect that can be probed beyond 3 mm at the site of a previous periodontal pocket does not signify a progressive lesion as long as it does not appear inflamed or contain exudate and bleed when probed. This suggests that there may be different types of pockets. The Location and Incidence of Accessory Pulpal Canals in Periodontal Pockets study found 2% of the teeth studied had accessory canals located within a periodontal pocket, which further supports the idea that there are different types of pockets. Therefore, we can categorize periods into simple, compound, and complex based on their depth and characteristics.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
