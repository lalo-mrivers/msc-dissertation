["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the usual radiographic appearance of an osteosarcoma. The documents provided describe various features of osteosarcomas, including their radiographic appearances. We can look at each document to see if it describes any of the options as a common feature of osteosarcomas. Document 1 discusses a case of osteosarcoma arising in osteogenesis imperfecta and emphasizes the importance of biopsy. It does not describe any specific radiographic appearance. Document 2 reports on 24 cases of primary osteosarcoma in individuals over the age of 50 and notes that features were similar to those seen in younger patients. This suggests that the typical radiographic appearance may be consistent across different age groups. Document 3 describes multicentric osteosarcoma, which has clinical and radiographical features that differ from classic osteosarcoma. It does not provide a description of the usual radiographic appearance of an osteosarcoma. Document 4 reports on bone scanning in management of metastatic osteogenic sarcoma and notes that every patient had pulmonary metastases that concentrated the bone imaging radiopharmaceutical to some degree. This document does not describe the typical radiographic appearance of an osteosarcoma either.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
