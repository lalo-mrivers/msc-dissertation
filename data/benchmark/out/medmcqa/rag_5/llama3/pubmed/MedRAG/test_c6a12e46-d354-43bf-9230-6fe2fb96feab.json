["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the rapid onset of action seen by local anesthesia in small nerve endings. The relevant documents discuss various aspects of local anesthetics' effects on nerves, including their mechanism of action and duration. We can rule out options B (low pH) and D (increased resting potential) as not being directly related to the rapid onset of action. Option A is also unlikely, as increased threshold due to depolarization would suggest a slower onset of action. Therefore, we are left with option C: High ratio of surface area to volume of small nerve fibres.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
