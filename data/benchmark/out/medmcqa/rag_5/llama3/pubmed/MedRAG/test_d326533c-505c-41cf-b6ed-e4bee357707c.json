["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Since the documents provide information about craniosynostosis and syndromes associated with it, I will look for a document that specifically discusses syndromic craniosynostoses. The first two documents review the embryopathology and clinical manifestations of craniosynostosis, as well as analyze a series of 27 children. However, they do not provide information about specific syndromes. The third document discusses holoprosencephaly, which is different from craniosynostosis. Therefore, I will focus on the fourth document, which reviews the clinical and genetic findings in patients with sagittal synostosis. Although this document does not directly address syndromic craniosynostoses, it mentions that 37 syndromes with craniosynostosis are presented in tabular form in another publication (Genetic perspectives on craniosynostosis and syndromes with craniosynostosis). Therefore, I will refer to this table to identify the common features of these syndromes. This information is crucial for identifying the majority of syndromic craniosynosteses.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
