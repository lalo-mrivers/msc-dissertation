["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking which method is NOT employed to prolong the setting time of ZnPO4. The documents describe various methods for measuring working time, linear dimensional change, and rate of development of strength in dental cements. From these descriptions, we can infer that adding distilled water does not affect the setting time but decreases the setting time (document 1). Prolong spatulation time is a method to prolong the working time (document 3), whereas small increment of addition of powder to liquid is ineffective at extending working time (document 2). Mixing on cooled glass slab increases the working time but decreases the setting time (document 4). Therefore, adding distilled water is the only method that does not affect the setting time.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
