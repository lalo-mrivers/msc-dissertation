["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the number of cusps on a specific tooth. The provided documents describe various dental procedures and cases, but they don't explicitly mention the number of cusps for each tooth. However, it's possible to infer that molars are the most likely candidates to have 5 or more cusps, given their morphology and function.\n\nA quick scan of the documents reveals no specific information about the cusp count for individual teeth. The papers discuss tooth eruption, orthodontic movement, tooth replantation, and dental procedures, but not specifically the number of cusps on each tooth.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be based on general knowledge about dental anatomy.\", \n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
