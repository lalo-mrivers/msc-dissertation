["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the generation of compression when forces are applied on the lateral surface at an angle. The relevant documents mention materials handling tasks which involve lateral turning of the body, trunk inclination, and sagittal flexion and lateral bending of the spine. This suggests that the forces applied on the lateral surface may cause compression on the inferior surface.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
