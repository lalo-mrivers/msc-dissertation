["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to the documents, it is clear that long-term assessment of glucose control can be made by estimating blood level of glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c). This is because HbA1c measurements give considerable aid in the assessment of longitudinal blood sugar control in diabetic patients and may be a useful indicator of the efficacy of diabetic treatment. Additionally, studies have shown that HbA1c levels reflect overall diabetic control significantly better than do single postprandial blood glucose estimations.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
