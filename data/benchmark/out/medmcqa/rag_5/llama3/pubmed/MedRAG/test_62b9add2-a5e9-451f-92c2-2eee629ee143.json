["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, it's clear that the child has a fractured central incisor one month ago. The examination shows a necrotic pulp with no other pathological findings. Considering the age of the child and the nature of the pulp involvement, I think step by step about possible treatment options. First, there is no mention of systemic disease or facial pain, so focal infection is not relevant in this case. Next, I look at the pulpectomy procedure for deciduous teeth with severe pulpal necrosis, which does apply to a 4-year-old child. However, the pulpectomy procedure requires the tooth to be firm in its alveolar socket and without a fistulous tract after treatment, which is not necessarily guaranteed for a young child. Finally, I consider the removal of canal obstructions with the Endo Extractor, but this seems more relevant to older patients. Therefore, I focus on the treatment rationale of fractured posterior teeth and the clinical results after vital treatment of exposed pulps.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
