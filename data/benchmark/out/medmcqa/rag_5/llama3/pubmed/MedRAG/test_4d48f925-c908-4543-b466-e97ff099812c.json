["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the ratio of mesiodistal width to height of crown of maxillary canine. None of the provided documents directly address this specific question. However, we can look for relevant information that might help us answer this question. For example, the document 'Mesiodistal crown dimension of the permanent dentition of American Negroes' provides data on the mesiodistal width of teeth, but it does not provide information on the height of the crown. The document 'Crown component variation in the hominoid lower second premolar' discusses crown component measurements, but it is not relevant to this question. The documents 'Rationale and methods for crown lengthening' and 'The maxillary cuspid and missing lateral incisors: esthetics and occlusion' are also not relevant. Finally, the document 'Periodontal status of orthodontically treated impacted maxillary canines' provides data on gingival pocket depths and alveolar bone loss, but it does not provide information on crown height or width.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
