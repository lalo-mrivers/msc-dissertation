["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the activation of naive T cells. According to the documents, a naive T cell can be activated by an antigen-presenting cell (APC) through the traditional model of T lymphocyte differentiation. The first signal is delivered through the antigen-specific T cell receptor, and the second signal is generated by cognate interactions between T cells and APCs through adhesion molecules. Therefore, it is likely that naive T cells can be activated by a dendritic cell.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
