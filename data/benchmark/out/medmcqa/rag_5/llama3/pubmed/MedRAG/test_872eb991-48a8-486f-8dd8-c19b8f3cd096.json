["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, we can see that pain on IV injection of some anesthetic agents is evoked by the unphysiological osmolality or pH of their formulations. In one study, pain occurred at 1.0 osmol kg-1 during perfusion and 3.0 osmol kg-1 with rapid injection and increased with osmolar concentration of both saline and glucose solutions. Acidic and alkaline solutions evoked pain at a pH value less than 4 or greater than 11. This suggests that some anesthetics may cause pain on IV administration due to their unphysiological properties. Additionally, another study found that the frequency of pain on injection in patients receiving etomidate was between 32% and 53%, being rated as severe in 5-20% of patients. No pain was experienced by patients receiving thiopentone.\", \"answer_choice\": B}"]
