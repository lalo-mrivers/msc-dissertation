["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about tractions used in lower limb. We need to review the literature provided. The article 'Cervical traction' discusses various mechanical factors relevant to cervical traction, but it does not mention lower limb traction. The article 'Preoperative traction in patients with hip fractures' presents different types of traction (skin traction and skeletal traction) used in hip fracture management. The article 'Tibial pin placement and 90--90 skeletal traction may lead to serious knee difficulties.' discusses the use of tibial pins for 90--90 skeletal traction, which is also related to lower limb. There is no mention of Gallows, Bryant, Dunlop, or Perkin tractions in any of these articles. Therefore, we can conclude that none of these tractions are used in lower limb.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
