["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents describe C20-unsaturated fatty acids, including arachidonic acid (20 : 4 (n-6)), which is an essential fatty acid. The document 'Essential fatty acid deficiency in total parenteral nutrition: time course of development and suggestions for therapy.' mentions linoleic acid as abnormal after 1 week of fat-free parenteral nutrition. This suggests that linoleic acid is an essential fatty acid. Alpha-linolenic acid (18 : 3 (n-3)) is also mentioned in the document 'Comparison of C18-, C20- and C22-unsaturated fatty acids in reducing fatty acid synthesis in isolated rat hepatocytes.' as a precursor to other fatty acids, including arachidonic acid. Therefore, both linoleic acid and alpha-linolenic acid are essential fatty acids.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
