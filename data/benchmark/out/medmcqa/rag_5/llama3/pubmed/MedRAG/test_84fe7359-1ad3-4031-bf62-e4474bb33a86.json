["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about signs of impending Eisenmenger. Eisenmenger syndrome is a complication of uncorrected congenital heart defects, particularly ventricular septal defect and atrial septal defect. It's characterized by pulmonary hypertension, which can lead to right-sided heart failure.\n\nLooking at the options, increased flow murmur across tricuspid & pulmonary valve (A) could be a sign of Eisenmenger syndrome, as it's often associated with pulmonary hypertension. Single S2 (B) is a normal finding in children and adults, not necessarily related to impending Eisenmenger. Loud P2 (C) could also be a sign of pulmonary hypertension, which is a hallmark of Eisenmenger syndrome. Graham steel murmur (D) is not directly related to impending Eisenmenger.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B: Single S2.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
