["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents suggest that alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) is a reliable marker for neural tube defects. In the first document, it is mentioned that elevated AFP levels are observed in 14 cases of confirmed neural tube defective pregnancies prior to the 26th week of gestation. Similarly, in the third and fourth documents, it is stated that all cases of open neural tube defects had elevated values greater than 5 SD above the mean. Therefore, based on this information, alpha-fetoprotein (C) appears to be the best marker for neural tube defect.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
