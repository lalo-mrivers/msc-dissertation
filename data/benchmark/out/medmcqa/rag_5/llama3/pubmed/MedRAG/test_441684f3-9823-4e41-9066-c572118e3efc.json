["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents provide information on different types of insulin. In the document 'Availability of soluble insulin in mixed preparations of crystalline and ultralente biosynthetic human insulin', it is mentioned that mixtures containing greater than or equal to 70% ultralente insulin showed a reduction of greater than or equal to 50% in regular insulin content after one hour of incubation. This suggests that ultralente insulin has an amorphous structure. In contrast, crystalline insulin is described as having a different structure. Based on this information, it can be inferred that Lente insulin is composed of a combination of both amorphous and crystalline insulin.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
