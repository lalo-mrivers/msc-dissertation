["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the 'Pulse oximetry' used in the determination of something. Pulse oximetry is a noninvasive method for measuring arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2). This technology measures differences in the visible and near infrared absorbances of fully oxygenated and deoxygenated arterial blood. The relevant documents provided explain pulse oximetry's theory, instrumentation requirements, practical instrument calibration, common features of commercial pulse oximeters, specific clinical applications, and performance limitations. Given this information, it is clear that pulse oximetry is used in the determination of B: Oxygen saturation.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
