["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the pathway activated during Prothrombin time (PT) estimation. We know that there are two pathways for prothrombin conversion: one initiated by the prothrombin-converting complex and the other initiated by thrombin. The document states that the first pathway is initiated by factor Xa, factor V, phospholipid, and calcium ions, which is the extrinsic pathway. Therefore, on addition of calcium and thromboplastin to platelet-poor plasma, the extrinsic pathway is activated.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
