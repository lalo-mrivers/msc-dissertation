["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about increasing radio density. The provided documents are related to radiation and imaging, but none of them specifically discuss radio density. However, one document mentions 'backscattered radiation' which could be relevant. Backscattered radiation increases with the distance from the material towards the radiation source. This implies that as you increase the target film distance, the backscattered radiation also increases, effectively increasing the radio density.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
