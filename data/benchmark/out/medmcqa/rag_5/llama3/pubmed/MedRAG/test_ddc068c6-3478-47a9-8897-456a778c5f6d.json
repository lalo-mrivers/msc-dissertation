["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The age of 12 years is beyond the normal eruption time for the 2nd mandibular molar. From the information provided, we can see that odontogenesis of the 2nd premolar begins at an average age of 3-3 1/2 years. This means that the tooth will have developed and erupted by around 7-8 years old. Since the question is asking about the 2nd mandibular molar, which is equivalent to a primary second molar, we can look for information on the development of this tooth. According to 'Ankylosed primary molars', the mandibular first primary molar was ankylosed at an earlier age and more frequently than any other tooth. This suggests that the 2nd primary molar will also have completed its development by around 7-8 years old, which is below the given age of 12 years.\",\n\"answer_choice\": A"]
