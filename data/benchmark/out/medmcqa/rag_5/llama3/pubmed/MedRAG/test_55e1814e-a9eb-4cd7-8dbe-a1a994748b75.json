["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe various radiographic methods used for determination of tooth length or root canal working length. The 'Radiographic \\\"working length\\\" revisited' document suggests that radiographs are traditionally used to confirm the working length and evaluate obturation of the root canal system. This method is compared with electronic apex locators, which are proposed as a replacement. According to this study, the radiographic distance from the apical vertex was 0.7 mm shorter than the actual file position.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: None of the above.\""]
