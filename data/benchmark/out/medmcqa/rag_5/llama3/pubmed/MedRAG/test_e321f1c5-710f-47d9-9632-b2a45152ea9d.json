["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about nodal metastasis that is not seen on CT scan. The provided documents discuss various aspects of lymph nodes, including their histopathologic information, diagnosis, and biopsy. A key piece of information is the size of a node, which can be an indicator of metastasis. According to one document, 'Size more than 6 mm' is a characteristic of nodal metastasis.
