["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to the documents, laparoscopy is used to diagnose undescended testis. In this case, there are absent testicular vessels during diagnostic laparoscopy. Based on the information in 'The value of laparoscopy for 106 impalpable testes relative to clinical presentation', we can see that when bilateral undescended testes (1 or both impalpable) are found, laparoscopy is diagnostic in 75% of the cases, and intra-abdominal testes were found in 58%.
