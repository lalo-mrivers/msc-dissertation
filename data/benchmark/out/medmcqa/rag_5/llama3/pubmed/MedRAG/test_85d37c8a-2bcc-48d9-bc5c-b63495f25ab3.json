["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks for the causes of subcortical dementia except one. Based on the provided documents, Lewy body dementia is characterized as presenting with cognitive impairment and neuropsychiatric disturbance followed by parkinsonism or as dementia complicating established Parkinson's disease. This suggests that Lewy body dementia involves both cortical and subcortical structures. Alzheimer's disease is mentioned in some studies but its primary location is unclear from the provided documents.
