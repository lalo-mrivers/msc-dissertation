["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about spaces in deciduous dentition. We need to review the provided documents for relevant information. One document that stands out is 'Regional odontodysplasia' which mentions spaces in the anterior maxillary teeth, and 'Premature loss of primary teeth: part I' which discusses the effects of premature tooth loss on occlusion and space in the permanent dentition. Additionally, 'Space maintenance and endodontic follow-up: case reports' also touches on the topic of spaces in dental therapy treatments.
