["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the helminth implicated in causing pernicious anemia. We need to look for any document mentioning pernicious anemia and a parasitic infestation. From the given documents, we find that Pernicious anemia in childhood describes two children with pernicious anemia, and the defect appears to be the lack of intrinsic factor in the acid gastric juice. There is no mention of any helminth in this document. However, Chronic diarrhoeal diseases in adults mentions a poor socio-economic group having mixed parasitic infestations and pernicious anemia. Ascaris is one such infestation mentioned in this document. Therefore, we can conclude that Ascaris might be the helminth implicated in causing pernicious anemia.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
