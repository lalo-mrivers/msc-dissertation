["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents discuss allergic responses and the role of various antibodies. According to the paper 'Regulation of IgE antibody production by serum molecules', IgE antibody synthesis is characteristic of the allergic phenotype. In the paper 'Blocking antibodies to inhalant allergens and asthma', it is mentioned that specific immunotherapy can induce an increase in specific IgG1 and then IgG4 antibodies. Additionally, the paper 'Cytokines: clinical potentials for the allergic patient' explains that the production of IgE is a normal T-cell dependent antibody response. Given these explanations, it can be inferred that IgE is the antibody involved in chronic allergy.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
