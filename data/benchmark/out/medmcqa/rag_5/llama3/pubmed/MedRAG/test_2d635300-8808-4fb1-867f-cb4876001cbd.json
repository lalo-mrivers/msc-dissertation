["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the properties of orthodontic wires. The question asks about energy storage capacity, which is related to resilience. Resilience refers to a material's ability to absorb and store energy without permanent deformation. This property is not explicitly mentioned in the given texts, but based on the context of force production by closed coil springs and bending deformation studies, it can be inferred that resilience is the characteristic that describes energy storage capacity.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
