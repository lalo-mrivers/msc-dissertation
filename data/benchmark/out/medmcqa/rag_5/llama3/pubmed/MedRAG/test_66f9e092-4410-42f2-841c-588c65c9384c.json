["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the correct answer, I need to consider the types of scales that can be used for mean and standard deviation calculations. According to the provided documents, quality control schemes use results submitted by laboratories against the mean and standard deviation (SD) of those results. This implies that the data should be on a scale where mean and SD are applicable. The relevant document on 'Estimation of the mean and standard deviation using order statistics' also suggests that this calculation is possible when the data is on an interval or ratio scale, as stated in the definition of these scales.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
