We need to look for information in the provided documents that relates to infants of diabetic mothers. The first document talks about the association between maternal diabetes and respiratory-distress syndrome in the newborn. It mentions that the risk of the syndrome is 23.7 times greater than that for an infant of a nondiabetic mother. This suggests that respiratory-distress syndrome is one of the features associated with infants of diabetic mothers. The second document emphasizes the importance of understanding the metabolic alterations seen in pregnancies complicated by diabetes to provide comprehensive care of the mother and her infant, which does not mention obesity, learning disability, ketotic hypogylycemia or future diabetes mellitus as specific features. The third document talks about perinatal outcomes and reducing major complications, but does not specify features of infants of diabetic mothers. The fourth document discusses a personal series of 100 consecutive diabetic pregnancies with good results obtained by meticulous control and carefully coordinated obstetric and paediatric care, but again does not mention obesity, learning disability, ketotic hypogylycemia or future diabetes mellitus as specific features.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
