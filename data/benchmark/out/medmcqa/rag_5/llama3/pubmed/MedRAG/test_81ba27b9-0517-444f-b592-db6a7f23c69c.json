["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Acetazolamide is a non-competitive inhibitor of carbonic anhydrase enzyme. As a result, it does not affect the substrate binding to the enzyme (Km), but instead reduces the maximum velocity at which the reaction can occur (Vmax). This decrease in Vmax is the expected effect of acetazolamide on the enzyme activity.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
