["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about asymmetrical union of sutures resulting in a twisted skull. This information is relevant to the study on craniosynostosis. The study describes four patterns of sutural activity: normal, absent, increased, and wide. Absent or fused sutures can lead to asymmetrical union, which may result in a twisted skull. Furthermore, the study on long-term effects of rigid fixation on the growing craniomaxillofacial skeleton discusses the effects of premature closure of basal skull sutures, which can also cause asymmetrical union and twisted skulls.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
