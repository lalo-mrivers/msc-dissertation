["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The citric acid cycle is a metabolic pathway that generates energy through substrate-level phosphorylation. The question asks about the high-energy phosphate compound formed in this process. From the documents provided, it appears that the citric acid cycle involves the reaction mechanism described in [Mechanism of the reaction of substrate phosphorylation in the tricarboxylic acid cycle]. This suggests a sequence of reactions involving intermediate compounds such as complexes of enzyme and ATP, phosphoric acid, succinic acid, etc. Further analysis reveals that the high-energy phosphate compound formed through substrate-level phosphorylation is likely to be one of the nucleotides mentioned: ATP, TTP, ITP, or GTP.\",\n\"answer_choice\": A"]
