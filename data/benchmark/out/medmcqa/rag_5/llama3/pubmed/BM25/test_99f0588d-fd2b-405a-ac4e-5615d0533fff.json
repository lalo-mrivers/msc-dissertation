["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient underwent surgery at the lateral part of the skull. This information is crucial to understand the surgical procedure performed. Considering the documents provided, we can infer that the surgery was possibly related to osteomyelitis of the skull or a similar condition. Since the postoperative symptoms were aspirations without voice change, it's unlikely that the surgery affected the recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN) or the vagus nerve, as these nerves are involved in phonation and swallowing.
