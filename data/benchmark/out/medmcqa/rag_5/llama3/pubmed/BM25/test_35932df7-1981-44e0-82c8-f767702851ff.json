["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about a common sign of occlusal trauma. The documents provided discuss various topics such as chylothorax, common bile duct stones, air in the cervical annulus, and rationale for stabilization. However, none of these topics seem directly related to occlusal trauma. A different document discusses periodontitis and occlusion, which may be relevant. According to this document, the relationship between trauma from occlusion and periodontitis is unclear at this time. However, it does mention that temporary splinting generally is not indicated during the initial or surgical phase of treatment of the periodontal patient because mobility short of secondary trauma from occlusion does not impair healing. This suggests that occlusal trauma may be related to tooth mobility.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
