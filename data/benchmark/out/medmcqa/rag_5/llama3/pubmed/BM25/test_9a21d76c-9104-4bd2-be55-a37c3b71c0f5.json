["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the type of radiation effect that results in radiation-induced thyroid cancer. We can refer to the provided documents. The first document discusses the characteristics and results of determining individual doses of internal irradiation of the thyroid gland. It does not provide information on radiation-induced thyroid cancer. The second document discusses thyroid dysfunction after radiation therapy, but it does not specifically mention radiation-induced thyroid cancer. The third document mentions an increased incidence of thyroid cancer among A-bomb survivors, which suggests that radiation exposure is involved in the development of thyroid cancer. The fourth document discusses radiation exposure during panoramic radiography in children and notes that placement of a lead-lined thyroid collar resulted in significant reduction of the thyroid doses.\n\nBased on this information, we can conclude that the type of radiation effect that results in radiation-induced thyroid cancer is likely related to ionizing radiation exposure. This would suggest that the correct answer is B: Genetic, as genetic mutations are a known result of high-dose ionizing radiation exposure and can increase the risk of developing cancer.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
