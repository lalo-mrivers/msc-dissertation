["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the accurate sample size for this study, we need to follow the steps outlined in the 'Sampling in Epidemiological Research: A Case Study of the Prevalence of Brucellosis in Saudi Arabia' document. We know that the prevalence of the disease is 10%, and we want a relative precision of 20%. This means that our confidence interval should be narrow enough to capture the true prevalence with 80% certainty.\n\nWe also know that our alpha error (Type I error) has to be kept at 5%, which means that there is only a 5% chance of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is actually true.\n\nFinally, we want our power (1 - beta error) to be at least 20%, which means that there is at least a 20% chance of detecting a statistically significant difference when one exists.\n\nGiven these requirements, we can use the formula for calculating sample size based on the prevalence of the disease and the desired precision. The formula is: n = (Z^2 * p * (1-p)) / (E^2), where Z is the Z-score corresponding to our alpha error, E is the relative precision, and p is the prevalence.\n\nPlugging in the values, we get: n = (1.96^2 * 0.10 * (1-0.10)) / (0.20^2) = approximately 361.\n\nHowever, this sample size may not be sufficient to detect a statistically significant difference at our desired power level of 20%. Therefore, we need to increase the sample size until we reach a power of at least 20%.\n\nUsing the formula for calculating power, we get: Power = 1 - beta, where beta is the Type II error.\n\nWe can use software or calculators to find the value of Z that corresponds to our desired power level and alpha error. This gives us: Z = approximately 0.85.\n\nPlugging in this value, we get: n = (Z^2 * p * (1-p)) / (E^2) = approximately 3604.\n\nTherefore, the accurate sample size for this study is approximately 3600.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: 3600\"\n}"]
