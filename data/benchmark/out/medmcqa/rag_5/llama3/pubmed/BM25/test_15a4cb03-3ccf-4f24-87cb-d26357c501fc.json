["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the problem associated with wide divergent roots of primary teeth. The provided documents describe various dental findings, including rough hypoplastic amelogenesis imperfecta with follicular hyperplasia and multiple anomalies of the associated mesenchymally derived tissues, which may not directly relate to the question. However, one document discusses therapeutic pulpotomies in primary molars with formocresol technique, which includes information about root resorption and internal root resorption. Another document describes the loading capacity of teeth, including the shape of the root and how far it is inserted, which may be relevant to the question. Considering these documents, we can infer that wide divergent roots of primary teeth may lead to problems such as difficulty in extraction or pulpotomy procedures.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
