["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks for an indication or absolute indication for open reduction of condylar fractures. The documents suggest that open reduction is indicated when the fracture cannot be treated with closed reduction and intermaxillary fixation. In one document, it is mentioned that a relatively large number of patients (56, 15%) were considered to have an indication for open reduction of the fracture. Another document mentions that certain types of fractures, such as those caused by falls or road traffic accidents, may require open reduction. The type of condylar fracture seems to be influenced directly by its cause. Based on these documents, it can be inferred that open reduction is indicated when the fracture is severe and cannot be treated with closed methods.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
