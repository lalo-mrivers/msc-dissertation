["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"After reviewing the provided documents, it is noted that a malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor can show different types of differentiation. In one document, 'Malignant mesenchymoma within the right ulnar nerve of an 8-year-old boy' mentions mingling of the nerve sheath sarcoma and rhabdomyosarcoma which was separated from the adjacent striated muscles. This suggests that the tumor can show both nerve sheath and rhabdomyoblastic differentiation. According to another document, 'Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumour with annulate lamellae mimicking pleomorphic malignant fibrous histiocytoma', the presence of rhabdomyoblastic features in a malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor is mentioned. Therefore, it can be inferred that a malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor showing both nerve sheath and rhabdomyoblastic differentiation is termed as 'Triton tumour'.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
