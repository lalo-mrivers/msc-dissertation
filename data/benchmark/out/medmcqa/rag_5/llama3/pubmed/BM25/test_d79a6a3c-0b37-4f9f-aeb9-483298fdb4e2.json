["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, we need to identify the relevant information regarding the formation of the labial surface. From the provided documents, we can see that 'The skin of the nose is characterized by often conspicuously dilated openings of the ducts of many sebaceous follicles.' This suggests that the labial surface may not be related to the formation of sebaceous glands or ducts. Next, we look at the document on histology and cytochemistry of human skin. It mentions that 'All hair follicles on the surface of the nose and in the vestibule are completely invested with nerve end organs.' This implies that the labial surface may not be related to hair follicles either. Finally, we can refer to the document on the movement of entire cell populations during renewal of the rat incisor. It discusses the formation of enamel and dentin, but does not provide specific information about the labial surface.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: 4 lobes\""]
