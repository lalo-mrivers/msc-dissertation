["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the function of fluoride flux in the soldering process. The relevant documents are Mechanic-technological and metallographical studies on soldering of dental alloys and Biological mechanisms of fluorosis and level and timing of systemic exposure to fluoride with respect to fluorosis. According to these documents, it can be proved that the reliability of soldering is not very high due to the properties of solidity and quality of compounds which vary greatly. This is unavoidable in spite of the most careful execution of the welding and observation of the corresponding soldering directions. Low sigmaB-values are attributable to several factors including insufficient filling of the soldering space, many lacunae in the solder commissures, and poor wettability. Fluoride flux does not seem to be mentioned in this context.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"None of the above\"\n}"]
