["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the nerve supply of the adrenal gland. The relevant document is 'The effect of 2-deoxy-D-glucose and D-glucose on the efferent discharge rate of sympathetic nerves.' This study records efferent discharges from nerve filaments dissected from the adrenal and renal nerves in rabbits. It shows that IV administration of 2-deoxy-D-glucose increases the discharge rate in the adrenal nerve filaments, while glucose decreases it. Transection of the spinal cord abolishes this response. This suggests that there is a pathway from the hypothalamic area to the adrenal nerve cells of the spinal cord, which affects the activity of the adrenal nerve.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
