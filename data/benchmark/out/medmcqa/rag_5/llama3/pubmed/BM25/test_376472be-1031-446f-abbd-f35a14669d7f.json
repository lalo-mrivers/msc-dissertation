["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the treatment of a 8-year-old child who had fractured his maxillary central incisor 10 months ago. The pulp shows no response. There is no periapical lesion in the radiograph. Based on the provided documents, we can infer that the child's tooth has pulp obliteration due to the trauma and lack of response to stimuli. The presence of pulp obliteration suggests that the treatment should focus on apexification rather than pulpotomy or canal treatment. Therefore, the most suitable option is D: Complete debridement and apexification.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
