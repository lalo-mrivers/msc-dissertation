["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the abstracts provided, it is clear that climbing fibers project to Purkinje cells. Therefore, we need to look for information related to the morphology of climbing fiber arbors and their targets. The first abstract discusses the early interactions between afferent axons (climbing fibers) and their target cells (Purkinje cells). It describes how at birth, climbing fibers project into the zone of Purkinje cells before these cells have aligned into a monolayer. This suggests that Purkinje fibers are the targets of climbing fibers.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C: Dentate nucleus\""]
