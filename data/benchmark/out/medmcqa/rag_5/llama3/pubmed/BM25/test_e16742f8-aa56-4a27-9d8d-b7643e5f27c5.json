["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy. The relevant documents describe anoxic-ischemic encephalopathy in the human neonatal period, which mentions that although the brain stem is considered relatively invulnerable to ischemic anoxia, evaluation of 16 cases shows that such involvement is a frequent and characteristic aspect of anoxic encephalopathy in the infant. The pattern of brain stem and thalamic damage appears to follow most acute asphyxial episodes in the human neonate and infant. This suggests that hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy can affect the brain stem and thalamus, but does not provide information about the limbs or muscles.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
