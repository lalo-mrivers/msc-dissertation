["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the effect of prolonged sodium channel inactivation on nerve conduction. From the provided documents, we can see that prolonged inactivation affects the rate of sodium conductance (Inhibition of the sodium inactivation of the nodal membrane by anemonia sulcata toxin II) and shifts the inactivation versus voltage curve (Selective modification of sodium channel gating in lobster axons by 2, 4, 6-trinitrophenol: Evidence for two inactivation mechanisms). This suggests that prolonged inactivation would slow down the recovery of the sodium channels from their inactive state. As a result, it is likely to increase the relative refractory period.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
