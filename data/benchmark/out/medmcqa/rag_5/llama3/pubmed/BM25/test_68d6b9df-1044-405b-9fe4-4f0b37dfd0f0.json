["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about amino acids with a positive charge at physiological pH. We can look at the provided documents for relevant information. The document 'Amino acid conferred protection against melphalan' talks about different amino acids and their effects on melphalan toxicity, but it does not provide direct information about their charges at physiological pH. The document 'Design assembly of an inexpensive, automated microbore amino acid analyzer' discusses the analysis of amino acids in physiological fluids, but again does not mention specific amino acids with positive charges. The document 'Sodium nitroprusside: factors which attenuate its action' talks about the effects of sodium nitroprusside on vascular resistance and the possible attenuation of its action by cyanide and acidity. However, it does not provide information about the charges of amino acids at physiological pH.\n\nThe document 'Changes in plasma amino acid levels during the human menstrual cycle and in early pregnancy' discusses changes in amino acid levels during different physiological events, including the menstrual cycle and early pregnancy. It mentions that some amino acids have a similar pattern of behavior, while others do not. However, it does not provide information about the charges of specific amino acids at physiological pH.\n\nThe only document that provides information about the charges of amino acids is 'Amino acid requirements of premature and newborn infants under conditions of parenteral feeding'. It mentions the importance of tyrosine, proline, and possibly glycine as essential amino acids for young infancy. This suggests that these amino acids may have different properties or charges than other amino acids.\n\nBased on this information, we can conclude that the document 'Amino acid requirements of premature and newborn infants under conditions of parenteral feeding' provides relevant information about amino acids at physiological pH. Therefore, we should look for information in this document about which amino acids have a positive charge.\n\nThe document states that tyrosine is an essential amino acid for young infancy, suggesting that it may have a specific property or charge. Similarly, proline and glycine are also mentioned as possibly being essential amino acids, indicating that they may have distinct properties or charges.\n\nBased on this information, we can conclude that at physiological pH, tyrosine, proline, and glycine are the amino acids with positive charges.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
