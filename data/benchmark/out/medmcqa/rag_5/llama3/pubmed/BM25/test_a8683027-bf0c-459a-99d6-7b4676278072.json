["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about a healthy volunteer who was tested for blood count (BT) after being taken for an experiment. The history revealed no exposure to NSAlDs, but the test showed increased BT. This suggests that there might be an underlying condition or medication causing the increase in BT. We need to look at the given documents and see if any medications mentioned could cause such an effect.\\r\\nIn the document about ofloxacin, it is mentioned that laboratory values remained in their normal ranges except for one volunteer who developed a 3-fold rise in one liver function test at the end of the study. This suggests that ofloxacin might not be the causative agent in this case.\\r\\nThe other documents do not mention any medications that could cause an increase in BT.\\r\\nBased on this information, we can conclude that the causative agent is not likely to be one of the options mentioned.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
