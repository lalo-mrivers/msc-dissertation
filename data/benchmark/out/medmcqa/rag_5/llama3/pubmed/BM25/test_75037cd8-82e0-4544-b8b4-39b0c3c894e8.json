["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the methods used for calculation of anatomical dead space. The relevant document is 'Influence of ventilation, exercise, and body position on techniques for determining steady state diffusing capacity'. This document discusses three different methods of measuring steady state diffusing capacity: DLCOss1, DLCOss2, and DLCOss3. Among these, DLCOss2 uses the measured anatomical dead space. Therefore, this method is used for calculation of anatomical dead space.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
