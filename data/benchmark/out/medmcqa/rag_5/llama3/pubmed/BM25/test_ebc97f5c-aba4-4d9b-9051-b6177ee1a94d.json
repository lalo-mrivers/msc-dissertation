["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Afterload reduction is a treatment that targets the resistance to blood flow as it exits the left ventricle. The question asks what is the best index to measure cardiac afterload. In the provided documents, we see that afterload reduction was achieved using various methods such as nitroprusside, hydralazine, and angiotensin. These agents were used to lower mean aortic pressure, left ventricular end-diastolic pressure, and systemic vascular resistance.\n\nFrom these data, it is clear that cardiac afterload is related to the resistance to blood flow as it exits the left ventricle. Therefore, the best index to measure cardiac afterload would be an indicator of peripheral resistance. The document that best supports this answer is the first one, which states: 'The drug significantly lowered mean aortic pressure, pulse pressure, left ventricular end-diastolic pressure and left ventricular volume.' This suggests that the study was focused on reducing afterload through nitroprusside therapy.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer would be D: Total peripheral resistance.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
