["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has normal LDL receptors but high levels of LDL. This suggests that the issue is with the function or processing of the LDL receptors rather than their quantity. The papers provided discuss various aspects of LDL receptor function, including processing and degradation.\n\nThe proline664-leucine mutant LDL receptor was found to be slowly processed to mature receptors and then degraded at a faster rate than normal. This could potentially lead to low levels of functional LDL receptors despite normal receptor quantity.\n\nPravastatin sodium, a tissue-selective inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase, was found to increase hepatic LDL receptor activity and mRNA levels in homozygous Watanabe heritable hyperlipidemic rabbits. This suggests thatpravastatin can affect LDL receptor function.\n\nUrsodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) increased LDL binding, uptake, and degradation in isolated hamster hepatocytes. This could potentially lead to an increase in the degradation of LDL receptors, resulting in lower levels of functional receptors despite normal receptor quantity.\n\nDesialylated low density lipoprotein (LDL) was found to be atherogenic and had a 2.5-5-fold lower content of sialic acid compared to native LDL. This suggests that a deficiency in sialic acid could affect LDL receptor function.\n\nIn the present study, we have previously established that LDL of most patients with coronary atherosclerosis differs from the LDL of most healthy subjects by its ability to cause primary atherosclerotic changes, i.e., the accumulation of intracellular cholesterol in the cells of smooth muscle origin cultured from unaffected intima of human aorta. Patients' LDL has a 2.5-5-fold lower content of sialic acid as compared with the LDL of healthy subjects.\n\nThe method of isolation of primary cells and their subculture influences the expression of LDL receptors on pigeon and chicken embryo cells in culture. Previous studies from this laboratory have shown that pigeon embryo fibroblasts in culture, derived from embryo explants, do not express LDL receptors. In contrast, pigeon peritoneal macrophages and pigeon hepatocytes in culture express LDL receptors.\n\nIn summary, the step-by-step thinking suggests that the issue is with the function or processing of the LDL receptors rather than their quantity. The papers provided discuss various aspects of LDL receptor function, including processing and degradation. The most probable cause is an accelerated turnover or degradation of LDL receptors, which could be due to a variety of factors such as the proline664-leucine mutant LDL receptor, pravastatin sodium, ursocholic acid (UDCA), desialylated low density lipoprotein (LDL), and the method of isolation of primary cells.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
