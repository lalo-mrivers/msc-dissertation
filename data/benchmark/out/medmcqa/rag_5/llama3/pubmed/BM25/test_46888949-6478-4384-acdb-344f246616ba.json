["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the type of bond found in Glass Ionomer Cement (GIC). Since GIC is a dental material composed of glass particles and an acidic monomer, it does not involve covalent bonds between atoms. Ionic bonds are not applicable as GIC is not an ionic compound. Hydrogen bonding is possible but not exclusive to GIC as it can occur in various materials. Therefore, considering the composition and properties of GIC, the most plausible answer is D: Metallic bond.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
