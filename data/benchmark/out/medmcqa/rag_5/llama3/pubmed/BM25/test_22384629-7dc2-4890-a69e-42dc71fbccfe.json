["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the type of fibers that are principal fibers of the PDL. From the provided documents, we can see that Sharpey's fibers showed a similar branching structure and increased in thickness as traced superficially in the cementum. Additionally, it was suggested that the principal fibers increased in thickness by means of the aggregation of fiber bundles. The development of cellular cementum was divided into two phases on the basis of the fiber arrangement. Early cementum contained a few Sharpey's fibers and many randomly arranged intrinsic fibers, while late cementum contained thicker Sharpey's fibers with branches and intrinsic fibers which appeared to encircle Sharpey's fibers and/or meander among them. This information suggests that principal fibers are composed of collagenous and elastic fibers.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: Collagenous and elastic\""]
