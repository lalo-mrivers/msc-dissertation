["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant document is [The effect of elastase on aminonucleoside nephrosis--on renal vascular system]. It describes the constriction of efferent arterioles and its effects on glomerular function. According to the study, constriction of the efferent arteriole can lead to decreased GFR (glomerular filtration rate), increased glomerular hydrostatic pressure, and possibly even decreased blood flow in peritubular vessels. However, there is no mention of increased oncotic pressure in peritubular vessels as an effect of efferent arteriole constriction.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
