["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about Class-II inlay gingival margins preparation. The provided documents do not specifically discuss the preparation of Class-II inlay gingival margins. However, we can look at the relevant documents that describe cavity finishing methods and their effects on marginal leakage and gingival health. From [The effect of cavity finishing on the initial sealing capacity of amalgam fillings in vitro], we know that different finishing methods can affect marginal leakage. In [The effect of placement of cervical margins of class II amalgam restorations on plaque accumulation and gingival health], we see that supragingival finishing of Class-II cavities results in improved gingival health. These documents do not provide information about removal of weak enamel rods, metal burnishability, or lap sliding fit of metal margin.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
