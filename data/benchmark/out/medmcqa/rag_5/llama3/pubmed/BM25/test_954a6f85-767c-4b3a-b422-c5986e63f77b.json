["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about excessive occlusal forces that can be superimposed. Looking at the relevant documents, we see that the forces exerted on the occlusal surface seldom exceeded 10 to 15 pounds (Functional occlusal forces: an investigation by telemetry). Forces directed away from the implants were noted in all subjects (The influence of occlusal surface material on peak masticatory forces using osseointegrated implant-supported prostheses). In general, masticatory forces are light and fleeting, suggesting that they may not pose a significant threat to bone preservation. However, bruxing forces must be adequately attenuated to ensure bone preservation (A biomechanical rationale for the use of short implants).\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
