["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The main mechanism of action for tramadol is the stimulation of mu opioid receptors. However, it also has a non-opioid component that contributes to its analgesic effect. This non-opioid component is the inhibition of serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake. This was demonstrated in the paper 'Interaction of the central analgesic, tramadol, with the uptake and release of 5-hydroxytryptamine in the rat brain in vitro.' The study showed that tramadol inhibited the uptake of [3H]-5-HT into purified rat frontal cortex synaptosomes with an IC50 of 3.1 microM.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A: Serotonin and nor-adrenaline reuptake inhibition\""]
