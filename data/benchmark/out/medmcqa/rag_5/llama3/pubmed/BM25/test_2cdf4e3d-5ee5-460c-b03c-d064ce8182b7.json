["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, it is clear that diphtheria toxin and botulinum toxin are two different types of toxins. Diphtheria toxin is discussed in 'Uptake of diphtheria toxin and its fragment A moiety by mammalian cells in culture' and 'Comparison of diphtheria intoxication in human and nonhuman cell lines and their resistant variants'. Botulinum toxin, on the other hand, is discussed in 'Isolation and properties of highly purified C1. botulinum toxin type E' and 'Absorption of botulinal toxin from the gastrointestinal tract'. There is no mention of bacteriocidal toxin in any of these documents, nor are there any references to a 'zone of contamination', 'zone of infection', 'zone of stimulation', or 'zone of irritation'. Therefore, it appears that the question is referring to a different type of toxin.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
