["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking which characteristic is common to both zinc eugenol cement and polycarboxylate cement. We need to find the commonalities between these two cements from the given documents. Both cements exhibit marginal leakage (in vivo evaluation of marginal leakage of four inlay cements) and are cytotoxic (toxicity of some dental cements in a cell culture system). Additionally, polycarboxylate cement is known to form chemical bonds with tooth structure (adhesion of polycarboxylate cements to dental casting alloys), which is also true for zinc eugenol cement. This characteristic is not mentioned in the context of zinc phosphate cement, so it's unlikely that this is a common feature. Substitution of eugenol by EBA to increase strength of cement is specific to one type of cement and doesn't seem relevant. Polyacrylic acid being liquid is also not directly related to the characteristics of these two cements.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B: Chemical bond to tooth structure\""]
