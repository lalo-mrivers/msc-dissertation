["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the effects of premature fusion of the coronal suture on skull morphology. In one study, premature fusion resulted in significant changes in the angular dimensions in the vault toward an anteroposterior shortening, which is consistent with brachycephaly. Additionally, another study found that early release of the fusion led to rapid separation of the bones at the suture site and spontaneous correction of the deformity, also supporting the diagnosis of brachycephaly.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
