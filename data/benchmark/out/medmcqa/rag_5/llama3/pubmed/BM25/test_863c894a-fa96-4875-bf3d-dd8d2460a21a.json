["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about intrafusal fibres. We need to analyze the given documents to find information related to intrafusal fibres. From the document 'Biometrical and histochemical comparison between extra- and intrafusal muscle fibres following tenotomy', we can see that there is a predominant atrophy of type II extrafusal as well as intrafusal fibres in the period of immobilization, but when the muscle becomes functional again, the intrafusal type II fibres remain atrophic. From the document 'Motor control of nuclear bag and nuclear chain intrafusal fibres in isolated living muscle spindles from the cat', we can see that there are different types of intrafusal fibres, such as nuclear bag and nuclear chain fibres. The document also explains how these fibres are controlled by fusimotor axons.\n\nFrom the document 'Cinematographic analysis of contractile events produced in intrafusal muscle fibres by stimulation of static and dynamic fusimotor axons', we can see that different types of intrafusal fibres have different properties, such as contraction speed and strength. The document also explains how these fibres are innervated by static and dynamic gamma axons.\n\nFrom the document 'Muscle spindles in denervated and reinnervated m. soleus of the rat. II. Changes in the extra- and intrafusal muscle fibers', we can see that there are changes in intrafusal fibres after denervation and reinnervation, such as atrophy and hypertrophy.\n\nFinally, from the document 'Fast and slow intrafusal fibre type systems in chicken leg muscle spindles', we can see that intrafusal fibres can be classified into different types based on their properties.\", \n\"answer_choice\": D"]
