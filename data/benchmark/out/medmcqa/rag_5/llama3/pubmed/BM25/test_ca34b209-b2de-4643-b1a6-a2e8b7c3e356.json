["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about observing an occluded submandibular salivary duct. The documents provided discuss congenital anomalies of the submandibular gland and duct, but they don't explicitly mention occlusion. However, one document mentions that diagnosis can be made on physical examination. Since palpation is a common method for examining the mouth and neck area, it's possible that occlusion could be observed by palpation. Another option to consider is sialography, which involves injecting dye into the salivary duct to visualize its path. The other options, occlusal X-ray and thermography, don't seem directly related to observing an occluded submandibular salivary duct.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
