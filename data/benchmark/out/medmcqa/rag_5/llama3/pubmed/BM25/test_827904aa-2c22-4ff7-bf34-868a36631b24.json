["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the given documents, we can see that Reed Sternberg cells are mentioned as a characteristic of Hodgkin's disease. In the first document, it is stated that Reed Sternberg cells in 3 out of 20 cases of Hodgkin's disease exhibited cell membrane staining for TCR (all nodular sclerosis type). This suggests that these cells may be derived from T cells. Additionally, in the second document, it is mentioned that immunohistochemical findings were consistent with an activated T-cell phenotype for the atypical cells of lymphomatoid papulosis, the Reed-Sternberg cells of Hodgkin's disease, and the malignant cells of the T-cell lymphoma. This further supports the idea that Reed Sternberg cells in Hodgkin's lymphoma are derived from T cells.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
