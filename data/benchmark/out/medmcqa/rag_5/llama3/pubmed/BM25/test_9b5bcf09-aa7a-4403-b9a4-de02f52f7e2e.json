["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about a pregnant diabetic female who has been shifted from oral hypoglycemics to insulin. First, let's consider the fact that sulfonylureas cross the placenta and increase fetal insulin production, which could potentially cause fetal hyperglycemia and macrosomia. However, this patient is being switched to insulin, which does not significantly cross the placenta. Therefore, it can be expected that the fetus will not be exposed to a significant amount of insulin.\n\nRegarding the issue of increased insulin requirement during pregnancy, it is well established that blood glucose levels increase in pregnant women due to various physiological changes. However, this patient has already been shifted from oral hypoglycemics to insulin, so her insulin requirements would likely continue to increase as she progresses through her pregnancy.\n\nTolbutamide, a sulfonylurea, does cross the placenta and can cause fetal hyperglycemia and macrosomia. Therefore, it is not suitable for use in pregnant diabetic women.\n\nLastly, while tolbutamide has been associated with preeclampsia (PIH) in some studies, there is no conclusive evidence to support this claim.\n\nBased on these facts, option B 'During pregnancy insulin requirement increases and cannot be provided with sulphonylureas' appears to be the correct answer.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
