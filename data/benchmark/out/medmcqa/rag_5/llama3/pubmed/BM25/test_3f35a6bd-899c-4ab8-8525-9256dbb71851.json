["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about dense irregular connective tissue. Looking at the provided documents, we can find mentions of collagen fibrils with 67 nm periodicity in subcutaneous connective tissue (document 1). This suggests that there may be a type of connective tissue that has a unique structure. In document 2, it is mentioned that the pelvic connective tissue in female fetuses can best be studied in middle-aged fetuses (19-28 weeks of gestation). We here report that no supportive ligaments of the uterus are found in fetuses of that age group... A triangularly-shaped plate of dense connective tissue is situated at each lateral border of the cervix uteri. Dorsally it is continuous with the circularly running fibres of the rectouterine pouch.\" This suggests that there may be a type of dense connective tissue present in this region. Document 3 talks about changes in biogenic amines and connective tissue in the process of chemical carcinogenesis, but does not specifically mention dense irregular connective tissue.\",\n\"answer_choice\": A"]
