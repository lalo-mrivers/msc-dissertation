["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the maximum contribution to the refractive power of the eye. From the provided documents, we can see that there are three main components of the eye that contribute to its refractive power: the cornea and the crystalline lens, which work together to compensate for the axial length of the eye.\n\nCrystalline Lens Power in Myopia suggests that the reduction in crystalline lens power tends to reduce myopia. The document also states that there is a significant difference (p < 0.05) in crystalline lens power between myopic and emmetropic subjects.\n\nThe regulation of Eye Growth and Refractive State: An Experimental Study of Emmetropization implies that the growth of the eye, including the axial length, is regulated by a complex process involving visual and non-visual mechanisms.\n\nEmmertopizing and Iseikonic Implant Lens: Computer Calculation of the Refractive Power and its Accuracy suggests that the preoperative calculation of the power of a lens prosthesis requires accurate measurement of the axial length.\n\nTherefore, considering all these documents, it can be inferred that the maximum contribution to the refractive power of the eye is by the Crystalline Lens.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
