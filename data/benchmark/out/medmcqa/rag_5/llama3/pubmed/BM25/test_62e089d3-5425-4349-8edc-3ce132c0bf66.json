["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking which process doesn't occur from 5' to 3'. DNA repair occurs by removing pyrimidine dimers through the action of exonucleases V and VII. DNA replication also proceeds in a 5' to 3' direction as it involves the synthesis of new DNA strands. RNA editing, on the other hand, is a process that can occur in either a 3' to 5' or 5' to 3' direction, depending on the type of editing involved. Transcription, being the synthesis of RNA from DNA, also occurs in a 3' to 5' direction.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: Transcription\""]
