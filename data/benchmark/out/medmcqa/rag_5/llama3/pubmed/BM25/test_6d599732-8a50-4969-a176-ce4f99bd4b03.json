["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the given documents, it is clear that epidemiological surveillance refers to the monitoring of disease cases, their trends, and patterns. This concept is discussed in multiple documents. The relevant points are: (1) Surveillance is aimed at the ecosystem of the disease rather than just the cases, which suggests a broader scope than just tracking individual cases. (2) The vertical structure involves various organizations, ministries, and territorial epidemiologists, indicating that this surveillance system has multiple levels. (3) Epidemiological surveillance permits prognostication of the epidemiological situation, implying that it is used to predict future trends and patterns.
