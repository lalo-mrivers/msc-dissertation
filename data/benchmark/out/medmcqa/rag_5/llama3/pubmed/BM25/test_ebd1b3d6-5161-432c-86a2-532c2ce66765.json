["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about Japanese encephalitis vaccine. None of the provided documents discuss Japanese encephalitis vaccine directly. However, they provide information on the disease itself and its antigens. Since there is no information about vaccine administration or schedules in the given documents, we need to rely on general guidelines for vaccine administration. According to WHO recommendations, Japanese Encephalitis (JE) vaccination is recommended for children from 1 year of age in endemic areas. No specific information is provided about booster doses.\n\nComparing this with the available options: A and B are not mentioned in any specific context related to JE vaccine; C mentions booster doses but does not specify the frequency, which matches WHO guidelines. D seems more related to vaccination strategy in endemic areas, and since it does not mention infants less than 6 months, option A is likely not true.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer would be A: Not given for infants less than 6 months.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
