["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about reducing hardness of orthodontic wires. The relevant documents are about the properties of metal alloys. From the documents, it can be inferred that Cobalt (Co) is a key component in Co-Cr-Ni ternary alloys and 20 carat dental gold alloy. Additionally, the document '[The influence of different heat treatments on a dental Co-Cr alloy]' suggests that aging at temperatures above 600 degrees C can change the microstructure and hardness of Co-based alloys.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
