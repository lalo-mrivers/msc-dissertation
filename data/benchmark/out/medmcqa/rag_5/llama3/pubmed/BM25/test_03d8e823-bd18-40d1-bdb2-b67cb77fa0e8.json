["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks for which type of Glomerulonephritis has Nephrotic syndrome except. We have to identify the options that are associated with Nephrotic syndrome according to the provided documents. From the documents, we know that anti-GBM antibody mediated glomerulonephritis can present with nephrotic syndrome (Nephrotic syndrome in anti-GBM antibody mediated glomerulonephritis). Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) is also associated with nephrotic syndrome (Focal glomerular sclerosis and sarcoidosis). Minimal Change Disease is a type of Nephrotic Syndrome itself. Post-infectious Glomerulonephritis and MPGN are not typically associated with nephrotic syndrome. Therefore, the correct answer is B: Post-infectious Glomerulonephritis.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
