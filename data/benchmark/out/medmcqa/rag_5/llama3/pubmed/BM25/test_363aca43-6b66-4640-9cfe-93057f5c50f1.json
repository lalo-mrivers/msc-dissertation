["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the major mechanism of action of nitrates in an acute attack of angina. We can look at the relevant documents for information on nitrates and their role in myocardial ischemia. The document 'Endogenous and exogenous nitrates and their role in myocardial ischaemia' explains that nitrates release nitric oxide, which interacts with vascular smooth muscle and platelets to produce vasorelaxation, dysaggregation of platelets, and prevention of platelet adhesion.
