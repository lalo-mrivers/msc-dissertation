["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, we need to calculate the total number of neonatal deaths including stillbirths. Number of neonatal deaths is given as 450, and number of stillbirths is 212. Therefore, total number of neonatal deaths including stillbirths is 450 + 212 = 662. Then, we can calculate the total number of births, which includes both live births and stillbirths. The total number of live births is given as 12,450, and the number of stillbirths is 212. Therefore, the total number of births is 12,450 + 212 = 12,662. Finally, we can calculate the neonatal mortality rate by dividing the total number of neonatal deaths including stillbirths (662) by the total number of births (12,662), and multiplying by 1,000. This gives us a neonatal mortality rate of approximately 56 per 1,000.\", \"answer_choice\": D}"]
