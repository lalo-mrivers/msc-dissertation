["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the innervation of stretch fibers in striated muscle. We know that substance P (SP) containing nerve fibers are found within motor end plates of striated muscle (from document 2). Motor neurons, which release SP, control RNA synthesis in striated muscle (from document 1). This suggests that the innervation is related to motor neurons and not sensory nerves. The choices include A delta fiber, C fiber, unmyelinated fiber, and Gamma fiber. Based on the information provided, we can eliminate A delta fiber and C fiber as they are typically involved in sensory transmission. Unmyelinated fibers can be found in various types of nerve fibers, but it is not specific to motor neurons or striated muscle innervation. Gamma fibers are motor neuron axons that supply extrafusal muscle fibers, which are the ones being referred to here.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
