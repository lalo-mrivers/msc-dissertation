["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about how radiation causes cell death. One of the provided documents is 'Radiation therapy in cancer of the rectum and rectosigmoid' which discusses the use of radiation therapy as an adjunctive treatment for cancer. This suggests that radiation has a direct effect on cells, leading to their death. Another document, 'Damage to the cytoplasmic membrane and cell death caused by dodine (dodecylguanidine monoacetate) in Pseudomonas syringae ATCC 12271', discusses how a fungicide causes cell death through damage to the cytoplasmic membrane. This provides evidence that radiation can cause cell death by damaging cellular structures, rather than other mechanisms such as charring nucleoproteins or destroying mitochondria.\", \"answer_choice\": C}"]
