["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents discuss the detection of intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) using ultrasound evaluation. The Growth Potential Realization Index (GPRI) is used to assess fetal growth and detect IUGR. The GPRI values are also used to determine the Neonatal Growth Assessment Score, which classifies newborns as normal or IUGR based on their birth weight and abnormal birth measurements. Additionally, sonographic methods such as measurement of abdominal circumference, femur length, BPD, HC, AC, FL, and amniotic fluid volume are suggested for identification of abnormal fetal growth patterns.\n\nConsidering the information provided, it is unlikely that a single sonographic parameter will allow an accurate diagnosis of all cases of IUGR. Therefore, multiple parameters such as abdominal circumference, femur length, BPD, HC, AC, FL, and amniotic fluid volume may be more useful in evaluating fetal growth and detecting IUGR.\n\nThere is no specific mention of placental membrane or length of femur as a parameter for ultrasound evaluation of IUGR. However, the documents do suggest that an abnormal ponderal index could indicate growth retardation despite a normal estimate of fetal weight.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
