["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents discuss various types of osteotomies, including maxillary osteotomy. However, none of the documents mention the specific topic of preventing bleeding during maxillary osteotomy. Since there is no direct information provided in the given documents, we need to look for general information on hemostasis or bleeding prevention. Upon reviewing the texts, I found that none of the procedures mentioned require heparin or acetoacetic acid for bleeding prevention. Lactic acid is not a relevant option for this context.
