["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the effect of permanent bending on an orthodontic wire during clinical application. The relevant documents mention various properties of orthodontic wires, such as flexural rigidity (EI), yield stress in bending (sigma o), and pseudo-elastic behavior. Considering these properties, it can be inferred that permanent bending will cause work hardening of the alloy, which may lead to changes in its mechanical properties.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
