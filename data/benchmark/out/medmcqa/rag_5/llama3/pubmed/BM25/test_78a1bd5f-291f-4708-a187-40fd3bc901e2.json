["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for a type of skin carcinoma that spreads by local invasion and has no tendency to metastasize. We can look at the provided documents to find an answer. From the document 'Primary neuroendocrine carcinoma of the skin (Merkel cell tumor)', we know that this type of cancer tends to have early metastasis, which is the opposite of what we're looking for. Basal cell carcinoma, as mentioned in the document 'Local invasion by laryngeal carcinoma--the importance of focal (metaplastic) ossification within laryngeal cartilage', does not typically metastasize and spreads mainly by local invasion. Therefore, our answer is likely B: Basal cell carcinoma.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
