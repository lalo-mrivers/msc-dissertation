["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about gaining access to the Mesiofacial root of permanent maxillary first molar. According to the document 'Root canal morphology of the maxillary first premolar', the maxillary first premolar has one canal, 26%, or two canals, 69%. Since this question is about the maxillary first molar, not premolar, we need to consider the root canal morphology of the molar. Unfortunately, there is no specific information provided in the given documents about the maxillary first molar's root canal morphology. However, we can look at the document 'Tooth morphology following root resection procedures in maxillary first molars'. This document states that the Disto-Buccal root is the most commonly resected root in maxillary molars. Although this does not directly answer our question, it suggests that the Mesiofacial root might be located on the mesiobuccal side of the tooth. Therefore, to gain access to the Mesiofacial root of permanent maxillary first molar, a root canal instrument should be placed in the direction...\", \n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
