Clinical and genetic features of adrenocortical lesions in multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 also provide information on the adrenal involvement in MEN-1 syndrome. Surgical treatment of endocrine pancreatic lesions in MEN-1 reveals that patients may have a higher likelihood of having pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors. Pathophysiology and gene abnormalities of endocrine tumors provide insight into the genetics of MEN-1 syndrome. None of these documents mention posterior pituitary tumors, foregut carcinoid or parathyroid hyperplasia as features of MEN-1 syndrome.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D\n}"]
