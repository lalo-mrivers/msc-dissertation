["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about a 14-year-old rape victim who has come to the hospital at 22 weeks of gestation. The relevant documents provided are studies on attitudes towards rape victims, rape attributions, and reactions to rape victims.\n\nIn the context of providing care to this patient, we need to consider the following factors:\n\n* The patient's age (14 years old) and the fact that she is a minor.\n* The nature of the crime committed against her (rape).\n* The importance of preserving her dignity and avoiding any further trauma.\n\nFrom these considerations, it can be inferred that:\n\n* A male doctor should not examine her without a female attendant present to ensure her comfort and privacy.\n* The gynecologist may need to provide an abortion option upon patient request due to the pregnancy's advanced stage (22 weeks).\n* Vaginal swab collection is necessary for forensic evidence purposes, even if it may cause additional trauma to the victim.\n\nBased on these factors, UPT (urine pregnancy test) would be required to confirm the pregnancy and inform any subsequent medical decisions.\", \"answer_choice\": C}"]
