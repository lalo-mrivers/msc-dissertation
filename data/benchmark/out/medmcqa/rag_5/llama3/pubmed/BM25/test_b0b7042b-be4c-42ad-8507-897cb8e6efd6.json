["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents are related to adenoid cystic carcinoma of the oesophagus, primary adenoid cystic carcinoma of the esophagus, cytologic characteristics of adenoid cystic carcinoma of the cervix uteri, and a radiological study of the adenoid in normal children. The question asks about the position of adenoid. From the documents, I can see that one of them is related to the adenoid, which is mentioned in the title 'A radiological study of the adenoid in normal children'. This document provides information on the size and airway of the adenoid, but not its exact position. Therefore, I will review the other documents to find any mention of the adenoid's position. In fact, one of the documents is about primary adenoid cystic carcinoma of the esophagus, which mentions that 'The lesion was located in the middle third of the esophagus in 10 cases'. Although this is not directly related to the adenoid, it does provide some information on the location of a tumor in the upper part of the digestive tract. Since the question asks about the position of the adenoid, I will look for any mention of it in the radiological study. It mentions that 'the size of the adenoid was found to be the same in both groups though the nasopharyngeal airway was found to be significantly smaller in the children selected for adenoidectomy'. This implies that the adenoid is located in the nasopharynx, which matches one of the options.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
