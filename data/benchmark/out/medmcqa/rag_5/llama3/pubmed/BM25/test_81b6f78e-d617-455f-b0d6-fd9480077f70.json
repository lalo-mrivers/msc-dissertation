["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about cow's milk. We need to evaluate the given documents for relevant information about cow's milk. Document 1 discusses comparative aspects of milk proteins and mentions that most non-bovine milk proteins are homologous with recognized families of those of Bos taurus, alpha S1-caseins, alpha S2-caseins, beta-caseins, kappa-caseins, beta-lactoglobulins, and alpha-lactalbumins. There is no information about whey protein or carbohydrate content in this document. Document 3 discusses breast milk composition in Ethiopian and Swedish mothers, but it does not provide specific information about cow's milk. Document 4 discusses quantitative determination of complex carbohydrates in bovine milk and infant formulas, which is relevant to our question. It states that all structural families of complex carbohydrate micronutrients were performed on bovine milk samples. This suggests that cow's milk contains complex carbohydrates, but it does not provide information about the percentage of whey protein or comparison with mother's milk. Document 2 discusses positional specificity of gastric hydrolysis of long-chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids of seal milk triglycerides and has no relevance to our question.\n\nBased on this evaluation, we can conclude that cow's milk contains complex carbohydrates and possibly some homologous proteins, but there is no information about whey protein or comparison with mother's milk. Therefore, the correct answer is D: All of the above because it includes false statements about cow's milk having 80% whey protein not casein (incorrect) and having less carbohydrate than mothers' milk (no information provided).\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
