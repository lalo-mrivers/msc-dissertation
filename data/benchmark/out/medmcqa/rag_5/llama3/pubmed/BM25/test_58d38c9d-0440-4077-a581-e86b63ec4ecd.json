["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the direction of force that can cause a certain effect. The relevant documents mention various forces and their directions, such as orthodontic force, resultant otolith force, and bias force. The document on biomechanics of incisor movement retracted by Hawley labial wire of removable appliance suggests that the direction of tooth movement is not the same direction of orthodontic force, and is affected by resistant force of the periodontal tissue. This implies that the direction of force can affect the outcome of orthodontic treatment.\n\nThe document on [Clinically relevant biomechanics--1. Moment/force ratio--terminologic clarification] mentions the moment-to-force-ratio (Mi/F'), which is the only parameter to predict the direction of orthodontic tooth movement. This suggests that the direction of force can affect the outcome of orthodontic treatment.\n\nThe document on The motor cortex and the coding of force mentions that cell activity was not related to the direction of force exerted by the subject, but was related to the direction of net force, the direction of force change, and the visually instructed direction. This suggests that the direction of force can affect the outcome of orthodontic treatment.\n\nIn conclusion, the direction of force can cause a significant effect on orthodontic treatment.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"]
