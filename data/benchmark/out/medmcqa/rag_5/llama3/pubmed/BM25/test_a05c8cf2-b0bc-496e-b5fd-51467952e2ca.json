["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the document 'Low antibody avidity in elderly chickenpox patients', we can infer that the patient has low antibody avidity which is associated with susceptibility to reinfection. Since she acquired chickenpox 3 days prior to delivery, her immune system may not be able to effectively combat the virus. Additionally, the article suggests that reactivation of latent VZV presenting clinically as zoster is related to deficiencies in specific cellular immunity, and since this patient has low antibody avidity, it's possible that the baby may also be at risk.
