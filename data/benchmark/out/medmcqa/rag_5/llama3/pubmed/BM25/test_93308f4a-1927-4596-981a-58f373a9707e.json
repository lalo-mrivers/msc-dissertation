["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, I will review the documents to identify relevant information about modulus of elasticity. In the document 'Modulus of elasticity and strength properties of dental cements', it is stated that a zinc phosphate cement had the highest value of compressive strength and modulus. This suggests that zinc phosphate has a high modulus of elasticity.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
