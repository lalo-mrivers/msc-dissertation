["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The study highlights that Golgi tendon organs (GTO) are responsible for detecting forces applied to a muscle's tendon. This is evident from the morphological evidence presented, which shows that the unmyelinated terminal branches of the Ib afferent fiber lie within the spaces between braids of collagen, compressional deformation of which may occur when force is applied. The mechanical events within the GTO appear to explain how it functions as a biological force transducer under static loading conditions.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
