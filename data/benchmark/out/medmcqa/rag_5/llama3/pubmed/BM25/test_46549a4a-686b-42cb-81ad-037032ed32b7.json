["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, we can analyze the properties of high Cu alloys. From [Influence of surface condition upon the cytotoxicity of copper-gold alloy (in vitro) (author's transl)], we know that lower carat alloys (<50% Au-50% Cu) have mild to severe cellular damage and toxicity when heated and treated with certain solutions. This suggests that high Cu alloys may have higher corrosion rates. Additionally, [Studies on high temperature oxidation of noble metal alloys for dental use (I). Formation of oxide layers and oxidation rate (author's transl)] shows that copper in the alloys is selectively oxidized, leading to the formation of CuO overlying Cu2O. This indicates a high risk of corrosion. Therefore, we can conclude that high Cu alloys have high corrosion.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
