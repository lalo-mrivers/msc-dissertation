["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has BCLP with congenital absence of maxillary lateral incisor and impacted canine. The maxillary transverse width is normal. We need to consider the growth pattern of patients with cleft lip and palate, which shows inhibition in transverse maxillary growth compared to normal individuals. Therefore, we should not rely solely on SABG (surgical arch expansion) as it may not be sufficient to achieve adequate expansion. Instead, a combination of orthodontic treatment and surgery is necessary. The study on transverse maxillary growth in combined cleft lip and palate suggests that the spontaneous transverse palatal growth is inhibited in these patients. This indicates that we need to address this issue proactively by using expansion therapy prior to SABG. Hence, the treatment approach should be expansion followed by SABG.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
