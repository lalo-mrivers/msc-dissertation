["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking which option is not a dimorphic fungus. Dimorphic fungi are fungi that can exist in two different forms: mycelial (vegetative) and yeast-like. Based on the provided documents, we have information about sexually dimorphic populations of neurons in rat and fish spinal cords, but no information about fungi. Therefore, we need to look for general knowledge about dimorphic fungi. Pneumocystis jirovecii is a fungus that typically grows as a yeast, not as both mycelial and yeast-like forms. Hence, it's not a dimorphic fungus.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: Pneumocystis jirovecii\"\n}"]
