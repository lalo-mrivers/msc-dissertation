["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, I can see that denture cleaning tablets are mentioned as containing hydrogen peroxide, which is a caustic substance that can cause severe focal to diffuse caustic burns of the esophagus. This information suggests that hydroxide ions are involved in the reaction. Since alkaline material would fit this description, option B could be a correct answer. However, further analysis shows that all products were found to have caused severe focal to diffuse caustic burns of the esophagus due to the concentration of hydrogen peroxide that was liberated by these compounds. This suggests that sodium perborate (option C) would not cause such reactions and is therefore unlikely to be correct. Detergent (option D) does not seem relevant to the context of denture cleaning tablets, which are mentioned as containing hydrogen peroxide. Therefore, I conclude that option B could be the correct answer.\", \"answer_choice\": B}"]
