["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the study of calculus removal and tooth surface changes after using different periodontal instruments. The document [Calculus removal and loss of tooth substance in response to different periodontal instruments] discusses the use of hand curette, ultrasonic curette, rotating diamond and Roto-Pro points to remove calculus and examine the tooth surfaces by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). It describes the damage caused by these instruments on the hard substances of the tooth, particularly the border between enamel and cementum. The document [An electron microscopic study of dental plaque of the rat incisor] provides a unique model for studying how plaque is initially formed, matures and is degraded on the cementum surface. None of these documents suggest the existence of 'Toxic zone', 'Deposit zone', 'Instrumentation zone' or 'Take away zone'. Therefore, we can rule out choices A, B, C, D.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"None of the above\""]
