["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, we can analyze the presence of microvilli in different cell types. In 'Effects of hypophysectomy and short- aing electron-microscopic study', it is mentioned that following PTU administration, the epithelial cells were enlarged, and marked hyperplasia and hypertrophy of the microvilli was present. Similarly, in 'pH regulates the polymerization of actin in the sea urchin egg cortex', it is stated that cortices isolated at pH 7.3-7.5 develop large numbers of microvilli which contain bundles of actin filaments. In 'A quantitative and morphological study of ectodermal microvilli in ten areas in the control and experimental prenatal rat', it is mentioned that some evidence is provided to show that there is an increase in the population of microvilli in the 276 hr (day 11.5) embryo following experimentally induced zinc deficiency and introduction of nicotine in the culture medium.\n\nIn 'Identification of brush cells in the alimentary and respiratory system by antibodies to villin and fimbrin', it is mentioned that these cells are reliably distinguished from other epithelial cells only at the ultrastructural level by the presence of an apical tuft of stiff microvilli and extremely long microvillar rootlets. In 'Electron-microscopic study of the excretory system of hungry females of the tick Hyalomma asiaticum P. Sch. et E. Schl.', it is stated that the cells of the Malpighian tubules and these of the rectal cas have the uniform structure: the apical surface is covered with microvilli.\n\nFrom these documents, we can conclude that microvilli are present in gallbladder (as mentioned in 'Effects of hypophysectomy and short- aing electron-microscopic study'), duodenum ('Identification of brush cells in the alimentary and respiratory system by antibodies to villin and fimbrin'), collecting duct ('pH regulates the polymerization of actin in the sea urchin egg cortex'), proximal convoluted tubule ('Identification of brush cells in the alimentary and respiratory system by antibodies to villin and fimbrin').\n\nHowever, we cannot conclude that microvilli are present or absent in specific areas of the excretory system of the tick Hyalomma asiaticum P. Sch. et E. Schl., as this information is not provided in the given documents.\",\n\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
