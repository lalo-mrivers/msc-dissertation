["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Thiamine is a cofactor for enzymes involved in the metabolism of pyruvate, alpha-keto acids, and branched-chain amino acids. Pyruvate dehydrogenase is one such enzyme that uses thiamine as its cofactor. Alpha ketoglutarate dehydrogenase also uses thiamine as its cofactor. Branched-chain keto-acid dehydrogenase is another enzyme that requires thiamine as its cofactor. Succinate dehydrogenase, on the other hand, does not use thiamine as its cofactor. Therefore, the correct answer is C: Succinate dehydrogenase.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
