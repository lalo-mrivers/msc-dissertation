["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the properties of polymethyl methacrylate. From the provided documents, it is clear that polymethyl methacrylate is a commonly used bone cement, and it has been studied for its potential effects on infection rates and immune mechanisms. However, there is no mention of the chemical stability of polymethyl methacrylate when heated to 260 degree F. Therefore, option B is likely to be true. Additionally, the documents do not provide information about the modulus of elasticity or tensile strength of polymethyl methacrylate, so options C and D cannot be definitively ruled out. Finally, KHN (Knoop hardness number) is a measure of the scratch resistance of a material, and it is mentioned in one of the documents that the KHN of polymethyl methacrylate is 18-20.\", \"answer_choice\": B}"]
