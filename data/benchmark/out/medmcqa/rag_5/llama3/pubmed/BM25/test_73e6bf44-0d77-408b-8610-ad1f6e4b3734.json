["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 6-year-old child with fever 5 days ago which has now subsided. The child's muscle mass, tone, and reflex are normal, but they have pain on palpating muscles. CPK levels are elevated to 2000. This suggests that the muscle damage is significant, but there is no evidence of neurological deficit.\n\nThe patient does not have Guillain-Barr√© Syndrome (GBS) as it typically presents with a more rapid onset and severe symptoms. Dermatomyositis is also unlikely due to the normal muscle mass and tone.\n\nConsidering the age of the child and the elevated CPK levels, Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) seems less likely as it typically affects boys around 3-6 years old, but they would have a more severe muscular dystrophy.\n\nThe patient's symptoms are consistent with acute viral myositis, which is an inflammation of the muscles caused by a virus. The elevated CPK levels support this diagnosis.\n\nTherefore, based on the patient's age and symptoms, the most likely diagnosis is Acute Viral Myositis.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
