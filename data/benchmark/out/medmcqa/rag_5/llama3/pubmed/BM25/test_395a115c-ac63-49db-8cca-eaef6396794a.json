["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 20-year-old male with hard painless testicular swelling. AFP is 3080, indicating a high level of alpha-fetoprotein, which is a tumor marker for germ cell tumors such as teratoma or seminoma. USG shows uniform echotexture and small areas of necrosis surrounding normal structures, suggesting that the testicular lesion may be benign or malignant. The patient does not have any palpable lymph nodes in the para-aortic, iliac, or mediastinal regions.\n\nGiven this information, we should prioritize a biopsy procedure to obtain tissue diagnosis. Since there is no clear lymph node involvement based on physical examination and imaging studies, we can rule out mediastinal lymph node dissection at this point. The primary concern is the diagnosis of the testicular lesion, which requires a tissue sample for analysis.\n\nThe available options are FNAC (fine needle aspiration cytology), Tru-cut biopsy, high inguinal orchidectomy, and PET-CT. While FNAC can provide some diagnostic information, it may not be sufficient to determine the extent of the tumor or rule out other causes such as inflammation or infection. Tru-cut biopsy is a more invasive procedure that can provide histological diagnosis, but it may not be necessary if the patient has already undergone USG and AFP testing.\n\nHigh inguinal orchidectomy would be a definitive surgical procedure that could potentially cure the disease, but it would also require significant recovery time and may not provide immediate diagnostic information. PET-CT is an imaging modality that can help identify distant metastases, but it would not provide tissue diagnosis or rule out other causes of the testicular lesion.\n\nBased on this analysis, Tru-cut biopsy appears to be the most appropriate next step.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
