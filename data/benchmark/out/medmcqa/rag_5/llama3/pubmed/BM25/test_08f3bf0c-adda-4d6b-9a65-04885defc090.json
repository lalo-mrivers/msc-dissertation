["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the binding of mRNA with ribosome in prokaryotes. In the provided documents, there are multiple mentions of mRNA interacting with the ribosome. Specifically, Spatial organization of template polynucleotides on the ribosome determined by fluorescence methods talks about the dynamics of mRNA-ribosome interaction. The document also mentions protein S1 playing a role in the binding of mRNA to the ribosome. Increasing content of poly A(+) mRNA of serum-stimulated cells in the absence of ribosome synthesis doesn't seem directly relevant to this question. The initiation codon AUG binds at a hydrophobic site on yeast 40S ribosomal subunits as revealed by fluorescence studies with bis (1,8-anilinonaphthalenesulfonate) is also not directly related to mRNA binding in prokaryotes. Binding of ribosomal protein S1 of Escherichia coli to the 3' end of 16S rRNA provides insight into how S1 interacts with RNA, which is relevant to this question. Finally, [Rate of ribosome movement along messenger RNA in E. coli under normal and inhibited translation] mentions that under inhibition of protein synthesis by chloramphenicol or amino acid starvation, ribosomes continue their movement along mRNA with a rate comparable with that in the control. However, no peptide bonds are formed ('abortive' translocation). This document suggests that ribosomes can still interact with mRNA even when protein synthesis is inhibited. With this information, we can conclude that the correct answer is B: Shine Dalgarno sequence.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
