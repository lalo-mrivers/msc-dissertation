["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant document mentions embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma of the nasopharynx. The paper describes four tumour cell types: 1. Undifferentiated mesenchymal cells with a big loosely packed nucleus and a small cytoplasmic rim with only few cell organelles; 2. Undifferentiated tumour cells with a broad cytoplasmic body which contains a dense network of nonspecific intermediate filaments with a diameter of about 100 A; 3. Immature rhabdomyoblasts with randomly orientated specific myofilaments; 4. Fully differentiated rhabdomyoblasts with well developed myofibrils often showing a sarcomeric pattern. The paper suggests that these cell types could be distinguished as developmental stages in the development of rhabdomyoblasts which are basically identical to those known from embryogenesis and regeneration of striated muscle.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
