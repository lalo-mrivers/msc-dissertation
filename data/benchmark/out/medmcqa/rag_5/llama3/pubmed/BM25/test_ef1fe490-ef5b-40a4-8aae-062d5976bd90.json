["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"In this question, we are given the average GFR (85 ml/min) and the standard deviation (25). To find the range for 90% confidence interval, we can use the standard formula for calculating the confidence interval. The calculation involves multiplying the standard deviation by the z-score corresponding to the desired confidence level (90%) and then adding and subtracting this value from the average. In this case, the z-score for a 90% confidence interval is approximately 1.645. Therefore, we multiply the standard deviation by 1.645 to get 41.13. Adding and subtracting this value from the average GFR gives us an approximate range of 74-96 ml/min.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C: 75-95\"\n}"]
