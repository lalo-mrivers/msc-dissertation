["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the mobility of sickle cell hemoglobin (HbS) compared to normal hemoglobin on gel electrophoresis. From the documents provided, we know that HbS has an additional intermolecular interaction not found in normal hemoglobin, which reduces its freedom of motion and lengthens the correlation time tauc. This suggests that HbS might have a different mobility than normal hemoglobin on gel electrophoresis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
