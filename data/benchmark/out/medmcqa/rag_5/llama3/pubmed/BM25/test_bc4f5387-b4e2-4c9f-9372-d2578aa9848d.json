["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks where virus is cultured. None of the provided documents mention Sabouraud's agar or Rogosa medium. One document mentions Sendai virus cultured from the tear film in 83% of the stimulated animals' eyes within 48 h, which implies that the virus was cultured from rabbit eyes.
