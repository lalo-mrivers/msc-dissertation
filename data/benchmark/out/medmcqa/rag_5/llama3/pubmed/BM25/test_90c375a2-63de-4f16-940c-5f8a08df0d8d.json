["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The ideal denture base material should have sufficient strength to withstand the forces of biting and chewing. This is supported by the study on mechanical properties of denture base material laminated with organic fiber reinforced plastics which showed that the flexural and fatigue strengths were improved compared to the traditional acrylic resin. Therefore, sufficient strength is not an ideal characteristic for a denture base material.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
