["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the structure of sinus hair muscles in shrews, the tendon organs of cat soleus, effects of mithramycin on repetitive DNA regions, and transduction of circular membrane ruffling by the platelet-derived growth factor beta-receptor. None of these texts describe the insertion of tendons or muscles onto bones to form specific structures.

The only structure that is similar in all three descriptions is a muscle inserting onto another structure to form a specific pattern.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: Cheek\"\n}"]
