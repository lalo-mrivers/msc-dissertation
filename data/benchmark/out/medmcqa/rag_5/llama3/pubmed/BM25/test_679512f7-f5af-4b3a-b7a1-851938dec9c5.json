["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about preventing cross-infection of patients in digital radiography/RVG. The relevant document that might provide the answer is [Double-contrast enema]. The technique used was a solid state digital system (FCR 101) which suggests no mention of patient-to-patient contact or potential for cross-infection. Therefore, it's unlikely that the answer would be related to cleaning or covering with autoclaved cloth, ethyl alcohol, or sodium hypochlorite.\n\nThe closest relevant document is [Epidemiology of Enterococcus faecalis urinary tract infection in a teaching hospital in London, United Kingdom]. This study suggests that cross-infection may occur rarely if at all. However, it does not provide any information on how to prevent such cross-infection in digital radiography/RVG.\n\nThe only relevant document left is [A new technique for continuous sphincter pressure measurement]. The technique described uses a perfused sleeve sensor which measures maximal lower esophageal sphincter pressure continuously and accurately regardless of sphincter length. There's no mention of patient-to-patient contact or potential for cross-infection in this document.\n\nTherefore, the answer is likely to be related to digital radiography/RVG itself and not about patient-to-patient interaction. The best option would be a choice that covers the sensor with an impervious barrier.\", \"answer_choice\": D}"]
