["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the mortality rate associated with emergency abdominal aoic surgery. In the relevant documents, we find that in the paper 'Graft replacement was performed in a 29-year-old man for an abdominal aortic aneurysm associated with Marfan's syndrome.' it says that since the dissecting aortic aneurysm (DeBakey type II) accompanied by disruption of the right coronary artery developed 74 days after operation, the emergency Bentall's operation was successfully carried out. This indicates that mortality is not mentioned in this specific case.\n\nIn the paper 'Abdominal aortic aneurysms surgery in over 75 years old patients.' it says that operative mortality during elective surgery was comparable to that in younger patients, whereas the mortality rate during emergency surgery was notably higher than that in under 75-year-old patients. This suggests that mortality is higher for emergency abdominal aoic surgery.\n\nFinally, in the paper 'Prognostic analysis for postoperative complications of abdominal surgery in the elderly.' it says that the Mortality rate was significantly higher (p < 0.01) in the emergency group (11.9%) and relatively low among the elective abdominal surgery group (3.8%). This further supports the idea that mortality is higher for emergency abdominal aoic surgery.\n\nBased on this analysis, we can conclude that the mortality rate associated with emergency abdominal aoic surgery is likely to be above 10%.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
