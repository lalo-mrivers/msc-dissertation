["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, I will analyze the provided documents to identify any information related to post-transcriptional modifications of RNA. From the documents, I can see that post-transcriptional mechanisms of regulation were examined in the study on growth-regulated expression of vimentin in hamster fibroblasts. This suggests that post-transcriptional modifications may be involved in regulating gene expression. However, none of the specific post-transcriptional modifications mentioned in the documents (splicing, 5' capping, and 3' polyadenylation) are related to glycosylation, which is a process that modifies proteins, not RNA.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: Glycosylation\"\n}"]
