["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the function of a reciprocal clasp arm. The relevant documents are about prosthetic retention, semiprecision rest system, heat treatment on mechanical properties, and dimensional factors on permanent deformation. From these documents, I can see that a reciprocal clasp arm is part of an individually designed prosthetic retention, specifically for distal-extension removable partial dentures. It has either a retention arm and classical guiding or a retention arm and active guiding or two active guiding arms. This suggests that the function of the reciprocal clasp arm is to provide primary retention.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
