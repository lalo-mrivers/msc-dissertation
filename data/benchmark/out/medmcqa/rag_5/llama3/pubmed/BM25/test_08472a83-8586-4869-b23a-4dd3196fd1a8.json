["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about symphyseal fracture with lag screw fixation. The relevant documents discuss different types of fractures and fixation methods. Subtrochanteric fractures are classified into Type I-III based on the fracture pattern. Lag screws can be used to fix comminuted fractures (Type III) by converting them to Type I or II. In mandibular fractures, lag screws are used as tension bands to provide interfragmentary compression and stability. Compression osteosynthesis is a method that uses lag screws to treat various types of mandibular fractures. The document on torque load and types of fractures discusses the use of lag screws in cortical bone.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
