["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the documents provided, it can be seen that the intrinsic pathway of coagulation is associated with factor XII, factor XI, factor IX or factor VIII. The article 'Evidence against collagen activation of platelet-associated factor XI as a mechanism for initiating intrinsic clotting' suggests that collagen does not activate platelet-associated factor XI independently of factor XII. Therefore, a test that measures the intrinsic pathway would likely involve factor XII or one of its associated factors. APTT (activated partial thromboplastin time) is an in vitro assay that measures the intrinsic pathway by measuring the time it takes for blood to clot. It is commonly used as a screening test for bleeding disorders and can be affected by inhibitors of the intrinsic pathway, such as factor XI.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
