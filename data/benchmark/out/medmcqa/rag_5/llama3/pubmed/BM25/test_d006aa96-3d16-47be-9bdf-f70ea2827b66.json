["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking to remove non-working side interference. The relevant document is 'Dog behaviour as related to spinal cord temperature'. In this document, it's mentioned that 1 dog warmed its spinal cord in a hot environment. This implies that the dog tended to behaviorally reduce T (skin temperature) greater than Tspine.cord (spinal cord temperature). Based on this information, we can infer that removing non-working side interference means reducing.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
