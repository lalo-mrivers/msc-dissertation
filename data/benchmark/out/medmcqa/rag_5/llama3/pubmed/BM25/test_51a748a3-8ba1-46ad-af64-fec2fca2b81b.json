["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Since the Caries Assessment Test (CAT) is not mentioned in the provided documents, we need to find a connection between the CAT test and the caries risk assessment models. According to the University of North Carolina Caries Risk Assessment Study: further developments in caries risk prediction document, clinical predictors such as prior DMFS, pit and fissure morphology, and predicted caries risk status were the major contributors to the models.
