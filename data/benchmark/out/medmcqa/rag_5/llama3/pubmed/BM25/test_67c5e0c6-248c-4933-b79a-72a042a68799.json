["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the primary effect of tongue movement. The documents mention the biological properties and clinical application of propolis, which is unrelated to tongue movement. Tongue flap reconstruction in cancer of the oral cavity does not provide direct information on tongue movement's primary effect either. However, the document 'Tongue as a reflector of cerebral and articulatory dysfunction' discusses tongue motility test for three- to five-year-old children, which seems relevant. The document 'Tongue dyskinesia as an early manifestation of Wilson disease' describes involuntary tongue movements during rest and action.
