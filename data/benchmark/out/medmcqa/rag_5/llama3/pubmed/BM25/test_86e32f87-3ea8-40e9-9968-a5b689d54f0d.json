["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about a 26-year-old lady with a history of recurrent abortion. The relevant documents are Ethics for the surgeon, Plugging into technology, Heart tumour in the right atrium: clinical recognition and therapeutical management, and Diagnostic standards in geriatric surgery. None of these documents seem directly related to the question. However, the case study about a 79-year-old lady with a fractured hip in 'Ethics for the surgeon' is not relevant either.
