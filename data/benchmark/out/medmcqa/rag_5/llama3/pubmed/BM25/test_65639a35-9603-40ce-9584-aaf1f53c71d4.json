["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has a history of coronary artery disease and presents with decreased myocardial contractility on Echo. The primary aim during anesthetic management of the patient with coronary artery disease is prevention of imbalance between myocardial oxygen supply and demand. Since oxygen supply is limited by restriction of coronary blood flow, prevention of increases in demand plus maintenance of supply, rather than increases in supply, will achieve this aim. Mechanical factors such as left ventricular wall tension, velocity of contraction, and heart rate are major determinants of myocardial oxygen demand. In this case, the patient has a pulse rate of 48/min which is low, indicating decreased demand. The anesthetic agent that is contraindicated in this situation is one that increases heart rate or blood pressure, leading to increased demand.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C: Ketamine\""]
