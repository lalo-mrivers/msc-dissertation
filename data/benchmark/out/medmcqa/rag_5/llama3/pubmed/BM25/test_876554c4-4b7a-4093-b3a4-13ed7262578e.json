["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about a metabolic condition with phosphaturia and osteomalacia. Phosphaturia is mentioned in several documents provided. The document 'Role of parathyroid hormone in the phosphaturia of extracellular fluid volume expansion' discusses phosphaturia, which suggests that it might be related to the condition being asked about. In this document, it is mentioned that acute expansion of the extracellular fluid volume increases urinary excretion of phosphate, and this is accompanied by increased plasma parathyroid hormone concentration. This information points towards a link between phosphaturia and osteomalacia. Osteomalacia is also discussed in 'Fiber types and metabolic potentials of skeletal muscles in sedentary man and endurance runners', which states that the capacity for adaptation of skeletal muscle fibers is important for the metabolic response as well as performance. This suggests that there might be a link between phosphaturia and osteomalacia.\n\nConsidering the information provided, it seems that the condition being asked about is related to an enzyme deficiency, hereditary tyrosinemia. This condition causes phosphaturia, which is mentioned in 'Succinylacetone effects on renal tubular phosphate metabolism: a model for experimental renal Fanconi syndrome'. Osteomalacia is also associated with this condition, as discussed in the same document. Therefore, it can be concluded that the metabolic condition with phosphaturia and osteomalacia is hereditary tyrosinemia.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
