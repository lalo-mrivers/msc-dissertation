["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the predominant connective tissue cells of the periodontal ligament. From the provided documents, we can see that autoradiographic study of 3-h-proline incorporation by rat periodontal ligament shows that the rate of 3-H-proline incorporation by the periodontal ligament was 2.8 times higher than by the gingival connective tissue and 5 times higher than by the dental pulp. This suggests that the periodontal ligament has a unique cellular composition compared to other tissues. The document 'Significance of early healing events on periodontal repair: a review' mentions that experimental studies have indicated that healing at a dento-gingival interface under optimal conditions occurs at the same rate as in a skin wound, which implies that the connective tissue cells of the periodontal ligament are responsible for this healing process. Finally, 'Matrix metalloproteinases in periodontal tissue remodelling' mentions the role of fibroblasts in connective tissue degradation and eventual tooth loss, but it does not specifically mention the predominant connective tissue cells of the periodontal ligament.\n\nBased on these findings, we can infer that the predominant connective tissue cells of the periodontal ligament are likely to be fibroblasts.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
