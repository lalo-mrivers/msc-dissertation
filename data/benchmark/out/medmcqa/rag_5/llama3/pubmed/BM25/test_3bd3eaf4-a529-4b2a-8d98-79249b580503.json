The relevant document 'The CLED agar option in urine culture routine' states that the sensitivity and specificity of CLED were 98% and 99%, respectively, indicating it's a good medium for detecting bacteria. Additionally, the document mentions that fastidious microorganisms were accurately detected on C agar as well as on BA+MK. Therefore, based on these findings, I conclude that CLED is better than MacConkey medium for processing urine samples.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
