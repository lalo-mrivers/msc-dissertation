["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the effects of unsaturated fatty acid depletion on various cellular processes. In one study, decreasing the unsaturated fatty acid content leads to changes in the phospholipid pattern and membrane fluidity. Another study shows that unsaturated fatty acid depletion uncouples oxidative phosphorylation in yeast mitochondria. Additionally, an unsaturated fatty acid-requiring mutant of cultured mammalian cells has been isolated, which grows normally when oleate or other unsaturated fatty acids are supplemented.\n\nThese studies suggest that the intake of unsaturated fatty acids is essential for maintaining membrane fluidity and cellular functions.\", \"answer_choice\": B}"]
