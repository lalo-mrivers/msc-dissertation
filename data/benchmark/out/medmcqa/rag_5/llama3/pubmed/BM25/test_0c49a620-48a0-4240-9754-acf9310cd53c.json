["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the most common type of Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in the orbit. We look at the relevant documents to find information on orbital lymphomas. In [Orbital lymphomas], it states that diffuse well-differentiated lymphocytic lymphoma (DWDLL) is the most common histological type, accounting for 70% of all orbital tumours. This implies that DWDLL may be a type of Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, as both terms are used interchangeably in some documents. Since [Orbital lymphomas] does not specify whether DWDLL is B-cell or T-cell, we look at other documents to determine the cell type. In [Non-Hodgkin\\'s lymphoma--clinicopathological pattern], it states that follicular lymphoma constituted 8.08% of all cases, and this type of lymphoma was seen only in older age groups. As DWDLL is also mentioned as a common orbital lesion, we can infer that DWDLL may be a B-cell lymphoma, given its association with older age groups and the fact that follicular lymphomas are typically B-cell in origin.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
