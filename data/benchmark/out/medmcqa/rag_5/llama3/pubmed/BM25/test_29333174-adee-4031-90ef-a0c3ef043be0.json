["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe various types of nasal antrostomies. In the first document, 'How good is the inferior meatal antrostomy in chronic maxillary sinusitis?', it is mentioned that 44 inferior meatal antrostomies were performed. In the fourth document, 'Patency rate of endoscopic middle meatus antrostomy', a series of 145 patients with chronic sinusitis were treated with functional endoscopic sinus surgery and patency of the middle meatus was evaluated.
