["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The passage 'Adaptation of amalgams to cavity walls' describes the behavior of different types of amalgam when used to fill cavities. It talks about the dimensional change of the amalgam over time and how this affects its adaptation to the cavity wall. Fillings made from expanding or balanced amalgams mostly had good contact with the cavity wall, while those made from contracting material showed a gradual decrease in quality of adaptation. There is no mention of beveling occlusal margins or any property that would make it undesirable. However, the passage 'Computer simulation on creep of amalgam in Class I cavity' mentions the importance of elastic deformation of the crown and the gap between the cavity and the restorative material. This suggests that the property being looked for is related to how the amalgam deforms under stress.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
