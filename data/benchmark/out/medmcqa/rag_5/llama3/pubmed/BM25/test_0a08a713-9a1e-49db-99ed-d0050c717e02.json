["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the typical crown bulk distal to the faciolingual dissecting plane of a tooth. From the provided documents, we can see that the document 'Development and size of the teeth of Macaca mulatta' mentions measurements of both mesiodistal and faciolingual diameters of the mandibular premolars were found to be the best dimensions in discriminant functions for identifying sex in the absence of permanent canines. This suggests that mandibular premolars have a specific shape and size. The document 'Perio-prosthetic management in restoring teeth with reduced clinical crown in children' does not provide information on crown bulk or faciolingual dissecting plane. The document 'Pre-eruptive movements of the mandibular third molar' discusses the development of the mandibular third molar, but does not mention faciolingual dissecting plane or crown bulk. Finally, the document 'The effects of infraocclusion: Part 1' talks about the effects of infraocclusion on teeth, but this is unrelated to the question.\n\nAs for the answer, we can look at the options and see that mandibular second premolar has a larger crown distal to the faciolingual dissecting plane compared to other options.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
