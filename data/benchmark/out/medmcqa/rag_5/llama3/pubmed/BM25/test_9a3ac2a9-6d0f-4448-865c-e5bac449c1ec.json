["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The latent period of muscle twitch is given as 10 ms. This is the time it takes for the muscle to prepare for contraction. The contraction time is 40 ms, which is the time it takes for the muscle to shorten in response to stimulation. The relaxation time is 50 ms, which is the time it takes for the muscle to return to its resting state after contraction.\n\nTo calculate the tetanizing frequency, we need to consider the total duration of the twitch, which includes the latent period, contraction time, and relaxation time. This is given as 10 + 40 + 50 = 100 ms.\n\nSince there are 1000 ms in a second, we can convert this to Hz by dividing by 1000: 100 / 1000 = 0.1 Hz. Since the tetanizing frequency needs to be higher than this to overcome the muscle's fatigue, it should be at least 25 Hz (5 times the calculated value).\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
