["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the type of periodontal fibres that are consistent and reconstructed even after the destruction of the alveolar bone. Upon reviewing the relevant documents, we can see that periodontal C-fibres were identified as a specific type of nerve fibre in cats. The study found that these C-fibres had a conduction velocity less than or equal to 2.5 m/sec and responded to mechanical forces applied to the tooth from different directions. This suggests that C-fibres are sensitive to changes in the periodontal space.\n\nThe document on alveolar bone regeneration after removal of inflammatory and traumatic factors also mentions that significant amount of alveolar bone regeneration took place after the inflammation was resolved and the trauma stopped. This implies that there is a mechanism for rebuilding or reconstructing the alveolar bone, which is consistent with the findings of periodontal C-fibres.\n\nIn contrast, the other options (Apical, Alveolar crest group, Oblique, and Transseptal) do not seem to be directly related to the question of reconstructive fibres. Apical and Alveolar crest group are descriptive terms for specific locations in the periodontium, while Oblique and Transseptal refer to types of fibre orientation.\n\nTherefore, based on the available information, it seems that periodontal C-fibres are consistent and reconstructed even after the destruction of the alveolar bone.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"]
