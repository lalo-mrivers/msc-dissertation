["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the most consistent feature of rapidly progressing glomerulonephritis (RPGN). The provided documents describe various forms of glomerulonephritis, including rapidly progressing ones. The document [Rapidly progressing glomerulonephritis with antibodies against cytoplasm of neutrophilic leukocytes] describes the clinical and laboratory findings in three patients with RPGN. It mentions examination of ANCA (antibodies against the cytoplasm of neutrophil granulocytes) as an indicator of disease activity and effectiveness of immunosuppressive treatment. This suggests that ANCA positivity might be a consistent feature of RPGN. However, the document does not explicitly state the answer to this question.\",\n\"answer_choice\": A\n}"]
