["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the location of the contractile element in a skeletal muscle. The relevant documents describe the structure of smooth muscles, including airway smooth muscle, and provide information on the regulation of the contractile element. They also discuss the expression of troponin I gene in differentiated skeletal muscle cells. None of these texts explicitly mention the location of the contractile element in skeletal muscles. However, based on our understanding of muscle structure, we can infer that the contractile element is present in myofibrils.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
