["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the arrangement of hydroxyapatite crystals in Enamel rods. The relevant documents are from a study on Amelogenesis imperfecta, which describes teeth with enamel abnormalities. According to this study, enamel abnormalities were related to the shape and irregular distribution of the crystals. Some needle-shaped crystals were found together with large ones, roughly rectangular. 42% of the crystals were distorted. Widened interplanar spacings were evidence of an hypomineralization. However, the interplanar spacings observed in high resolution electron microscopy, as well as the crystalline degree of the crystals, revealed an apparently sound hydroxyapatite. This suggests that the arrangement of hydroxyapatite crystals in Enamel rods is not uniform and may be irregular.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"]
