["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the given documents, we can see that Golgi bodies are involved in protein modification (Ultrastructure of macrogametogenesis of Eimeria mivati), secretory pathway (Morphogenesis of the Hirano body in neurons of the squirrel monkey dorsal horn), and vesicle formation (Effects of induced pinocytotic activity and extreme temperatures on the morphology of Golgi bodies in Amoeba proteus). Additionally, it is mentioned that Golgi complexes are involved in the production of type I wall body material (Ultrastructure of macrogametogenesis of Eimeria mivati) and that vesicles attached to the external surface of Hirano bodies were observed (Morphogenesis of the Hirano body in neurons of the squirrel monkey dorsal horn). These observations suggest that Golgi bodies play a role in protein modification, secretion, and vesicle formation.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
