["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe various aspects of collagen structure and function. The first document describes the ultrastructure of mitral valve chordae tendineae, which shows a network of collagen fibrils. The second document discusses the effect of paraquat on rat lung collagen content, but does not mention long spaced collagen. The third document describes the fine structure of granuloma annulare and mentions the presence of fibrous long spacing fibers, which are formed from collagen. The fourth document investigates the interaction between collagen and alpha1-acid glycoprotein and finds that this interaction leads to the formation of fibrous long spacing fibers. Finally, the fifth document discusses the effects of colchicine on myofibroblasts in fibromatoses and mentions the presence of intracellular widely spaced collagen.\n\nBased on these documents, it is likely that long spaced collagen is present in the following locations: (1) granuloma annulare; (2) myofibroblasts in fibromatoses. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nanswer_choice\": \"C\""]
