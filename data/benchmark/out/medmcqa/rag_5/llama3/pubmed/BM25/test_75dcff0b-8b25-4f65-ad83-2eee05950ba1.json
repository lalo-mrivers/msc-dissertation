["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking to identify what should be reduced when there is a prematurity in centric occlusion but not in eccentric or other movements. The key phrase is 'prematurity in centric occlusion'. This suggests that we are looking at an issue with the relationship between the condyles and the teeth, specifically in the position of centric occlusion. In the provided documents, we can see that centric relation is the position where the condyles are in their most superior position possible in the fossae, and from there the mandible can travel neither forward nor backward without moving downward.\n\nThe TMJ series in the document 'An analysis of controlled mandibular movement' shows that patients with TMJ syndrome have a postero-lateral displacement of the mandible. This suggests that prematurity in centric occlusion could be related to this condition.\n\nIn the document 'Centric relation. Its effect on occluso-muscle harmony', it is stated that an accurate centric relation must be determined and verified before the condyle-occlusion relationship can be evaluated. This implies that any issues with centric occlusion would need to be addressed before considering other aspects of jaw movement.\n\nFinally, in the document 'Occlusion and orthodontics', it is emphasized that the occlusion should be related to centric relation and centric occlusion prior to, during, and at the completion of active treatment. This suggests that any prematurity in centric occlusion would need to be addressed as part of a comprehensive approach to treating jaw movement.\n\nConsidering these points, we can infer that when there is a prematurity in centric occlusion but not in eccentric or other movements, it is likely related to the position and movement of the condyles. Therefore, the reduction should target the opposing fossa or marginal ridge.\", \"answer_choice\": C}"]
