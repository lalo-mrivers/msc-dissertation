["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Cross-linking is a process that creates chemical bonds between molecules. In the context of resins, cross-linking helps to increase the strength of the material by creating a network of interconnected polymer chains. This can also contribute to an increase in hardness and crazing resistance, as the cross-linked structure provides better mechanical properties.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: All of the above\"\n}"]
