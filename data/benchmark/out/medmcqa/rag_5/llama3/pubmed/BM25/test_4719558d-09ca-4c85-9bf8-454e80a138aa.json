["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents highlight the treatment options for cancer of the larynx. The case histories reviewed in 'Current trends in the treatment of cancer of the larynx' provide insights into the results of different treatments, including primary irradiation, radical surgery, and salvage surgery. The document 'Partial laryngectomy as therapy for cancer of the larynx after irradiation failure' presents the evolution of therapy for recurrences of cancer of the larynx after radiation therapy. Although no specific stage-I treatment is mentioned in these documents, other studies provide valuable information.\n\nThe study '[Clinical course of laryngeal cancer in relation to sex]' does not specifically address stage-I cancer but highlights differences in 5-year survival rates between men and women with different stages of disease. The study 'Five-year results of 1000 patients operated on for cancer of the larynx' presents crude survival rates for different tumor locations, but it does not provide information on specific treatment modalities or stages.\n\nThe document '[Selected problems in the evolution of scientific examination of the lymphatic system of the larynx and the surrounding region presented for clinical purposes]' provides insight into changes in the lymphatic system after radiation therapy, which could be relevant to stage-I cancer. However, this study does not address treatment options specifically.\n\nConsidering these documents, it is difficult to determine a clear treatment of choice for stage-I cancer larynx without additional information. Nevertheless, based on current trends and available data, primary radiotherapy or surgery might be viable options for early-stage cancers.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
