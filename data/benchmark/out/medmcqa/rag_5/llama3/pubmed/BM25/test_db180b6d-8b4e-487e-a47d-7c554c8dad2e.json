["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks for materials that show chemical bond with enamel. In the given documents, we have various types of materials mentioned such as composites, resin adhesives, and bonding agents. The document 'Shear bond strength of ceramic brackets with chemical or mechanical retention' mentions ceramic brackets with chemical retention which exhibited significantly higher bond strength than the corresponding bracket with textured base. This suggests that chemical bond is possible with enamel. Similarly, in the report 'Resin adhesion on the young permanent ground enamel', it is mentioned that the highest bond strength was achieved when the enamel was etched with 30 seconds of etching time and then bonded with Photo Bond and Photo Clearfil A. This indicates that a chemical bond can be formed between resin adhesive and enamel. The document 'An in vitro study of the bond strength of two light-cured composites used in the direct bonding of orthodontic brackets to molars' also mentions various bonding systems including Right-on (R), Heliosit-orthodontic (H), and Transbond (T) which are used for bonding orthodontic brackets to molars. These bonding systems likely involve chemical bond with enamel.\n\nTherefore, based on the given documents, it can be concluded that BIS-GMA resins in pit and fissure sealants show chemical bond with enamel.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
