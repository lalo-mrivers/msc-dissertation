["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents provided information about impression materials, including their dimensional stability. The [Impression materials. Dimensional stability after pouring] document mentioned that every material examined offers an ideal time interval in which we have to cast the model in plaster. This suggests that the dimensional stability of elastomeric impression materials is not significantly affected by a disinfectant solution containing glutaraldehyde, as stated in [The dimensional stability of hydrophilic impression materials after application of a disinfectant]. The viscosity of elastomeric impression materials was also examined in [Viscosity of elastomeric impression materials], which showed that some materials exhibited extreme shear thinning properties. This information can be used to determine the dimensional stability of elastomeric impression materials.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: Addition silicone > Condensation silicone Polysulphide > Polyether\"\n}"]
