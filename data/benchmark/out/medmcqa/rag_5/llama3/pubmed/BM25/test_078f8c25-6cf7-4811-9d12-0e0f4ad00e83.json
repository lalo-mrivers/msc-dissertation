["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the most appropriate method to differentiate between a dentigerous cyst and an ameloblastoma. From the provided documents, we can see that both lesions have similar radiographic appearances (as mentioned in the case report of dentigerous cyst of lower incisor). Additionally, aspiration cytology may not be sufficient to make a definitive diagnosis as histologic findings showed that the lesion was an ameloblastoma that is believed to have arisen from the dentigerous cyst wall. Clinical features alone are also not enough to differentiate between the two lesions as both can present similarly clinically. Therefore, the most appropriate method would be through microscopic examination.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
