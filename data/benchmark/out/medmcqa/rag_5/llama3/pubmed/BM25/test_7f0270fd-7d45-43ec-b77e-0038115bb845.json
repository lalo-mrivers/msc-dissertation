["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the transmission of hepatitis B virus (HBV) from mother to child. In one document, it is mentioned that among 372 sera of mother-newborn pairs, seroprevalence of HBs Ag has been around 11% in mothers. The lack of anti-HBc IgM in all sera agree probably with a relative old contamination. Pre-S2 epitope marker has been found in more than 70% of HBs Ag positive mothers and 50% of their children. Large discordance has been noted between the prevalence rate of this marker and the HBe Ag and viral DNA, other markers of HBV replication.\\n\\nAnother document describes a vaccination program that included the use of recombinant vaccine (GenHevac BTM). At one year of the program, 97% of the children had received at least one dose of vaccine, 90% had HBs-antibodies titer higher than 10 mUI/ml, 96% had seroconverted for at least one of the two antibodies (anti-HBs and/or anti-preS2) and any of them was neither HBs Ag carrier nor anti-HBc IgM antibodies carrier.\\n\\nGiven these data, we can infer that the risk of transmission of Hep. B in child is likely to be around 50% due to the presence of both Hbs Ag and HBe Ag markers in the mother.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
