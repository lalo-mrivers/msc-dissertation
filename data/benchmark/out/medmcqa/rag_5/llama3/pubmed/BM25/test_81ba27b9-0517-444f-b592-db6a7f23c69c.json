["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Acetazolamide is a non-competitive inhibitor of carbonic anhydrase enzyme. Non-competitive inhibitors bind to the enzyme at a site distinct from the substrate and prevent the enzyme from functioning. In this case, Acetazolamide binds to the enzyme and prevents it from performing its normal function. This would lead to a decrease in Vmax as the enzyme's ability to catalyze the reaction is impaired.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
