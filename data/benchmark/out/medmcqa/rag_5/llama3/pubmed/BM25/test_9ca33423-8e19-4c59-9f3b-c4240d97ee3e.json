["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about essential amino acids. From the provided documents, we can see that valine is mentioned in [Amino acid composition of Actinomyces mycelium] as one of the most favourable amino acids for synthesis on a chemically defined medium. In [P-aminohippurate accumulation in kidney cortex slices: stimulation by dicarboxylates, amino acids and their oxoanalogues], valine is also listed among the compounds that increase PAH tissue to medium ratio (T/MPAH). Therefore, it can be inferred that valine is an essential amino acid. Additionally, histidine is mentioned in [P-aminohippurate accumulation in kidney cortex slices: stimulation by dicarboxylates, amino acids and their oxoanalogues] as one of the compounds that increase T/MPAH. From [Research on the catabolism of phosphonic acids: biodegradation of the C-P bond by Pseudomonas aeruginosa], there is no relevant information about essential amino acids. Therefore, only valine and histidine are considered as potential essential amino acids.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
