["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the relevant documents, we can see that the posterior part of the tongue is innervated by nerve fibers from the deep layers of the tongue. In 'Neurohistological observations on the tongue of the tufted capuchin', it was noted that the Cebus tongue presents few vallate papilae situated mainly in the posterior and lateral parts, which are supplied with abundant nerve fibers. In 'Vasodilator fibres to the tongue in the chorda tympani proper nerve', we can see that the gustatory fibers from the posterior part of the tongue run in the IX nerve. Therefore, it is likely that the sensory nerve fibers to the posterior one third of the tongue are supplied by the IX cranial nerve.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
