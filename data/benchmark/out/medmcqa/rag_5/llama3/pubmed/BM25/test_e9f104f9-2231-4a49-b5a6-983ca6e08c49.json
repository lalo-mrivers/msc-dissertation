["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The document [Kinetics and load distribution of supported free-end prostheses. IV. Effect of the saddle curvature on the saddle resp. abutment kinetics and the load distribution in prosthesis beds without abutments] describes the effect of the saddle curvature on abutment tooth stress, which is independent of the length of the saddle and/or of the saddle curvature. This suggests that a pier abutment may be affected by the presence of an edentulous space, as described in [Change of the pier distance in saw models dependent on the setting expansion of the base cast].\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
