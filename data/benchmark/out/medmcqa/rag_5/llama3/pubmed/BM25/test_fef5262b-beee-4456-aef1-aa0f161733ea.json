["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe histamine release from various cell types, including leukocytes, basophils, and mast cells. Histamine is also mentioned as a neurotransmitter candidate for Drosophila photoreceptors. In one study, it is noted that histamine increases cytosolic calcium concentration in platelets stimulated with thrombin. However, there is no mention of histamine presence on the surface of erythrocytes or neutrophils. Mast cells are mentioned as releasing histamine, but not necessarily having histamine on their surface. Lymphocytes are not explicitly mentioned in this context.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
