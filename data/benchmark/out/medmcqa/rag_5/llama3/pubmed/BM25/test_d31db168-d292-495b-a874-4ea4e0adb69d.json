["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the shape of the lower 2nd molar. We can rule out option D (H shaped) because none of the provided documents mention H shaped molars. The document 'A pregnancy with a hydatidiform mole, thyreotoxicosis and live-born infant.' does not mention molar shapes. The radiographic study on 2nd premolars does not specifically discuss lower 2nd molars either. The distribution of glycoconjugates during mouse molar root development is also not relevant to the shape of human molars. The 'Cases six years postretention' document discusses cephalometric measurements and orthodontic treatment, but it does not provide information on molar shapes. The study on hemo-genetic polymorphism markers in the Lower Rhine region does not mention molar shapes at all. Therefore, we can rule out options A ('+' shape), B (Distorted '+' shape) and D (H shaped). This leaves us with option C: Y shaped.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
