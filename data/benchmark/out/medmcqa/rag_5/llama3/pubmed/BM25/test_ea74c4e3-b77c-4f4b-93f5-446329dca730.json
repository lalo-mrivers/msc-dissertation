["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, I will analyze each option to determine which one leads to an increase in enzyme activity. Option A (Increase in temperature) is ruled out as it does not match with any of the mentioned scenarios. Options C and D are also excluded as they do not result in increased enzyme activity but rather affect its stability or substrate availability. This leaves us with only one option, B (Decrease in activation energy), which is supported by the study on uridine kinase where cycloheximide led to an enhancement of enzyme activity.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
