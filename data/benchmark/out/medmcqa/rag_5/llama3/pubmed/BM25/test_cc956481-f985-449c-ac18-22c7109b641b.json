["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about measuring variation between two different units. The relevant document is 'Measuring concentrations of C3a or C5a in supernatant blood or serum after contact with the surface has been the most usual way of assessing this activation.' This suggests that we are looking at measuring differences between two quantities, specifically concentrations of protein fragments. In this context, variance is a suitable measure for comparing these differences.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
