["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about a 6-month-old child with Tetralogy of Fallot who develops a cyanotic spell initiated by crying. This scenario reminds me of the 'tet' spells that can occur in children with tetralogy of Fallot, characterized by a sudden increase in pulmonary blood flow and right ventricular pressure. The 'tet' spells are often provoked by crying or other physiological stimuli.\n\nI'm looking for a drug to avoid, which makes me think about the treatment options for these 'tet' spells. Propranolol is often used to manage them because it can help reduce the increased pulmonary blood flow and right ventricular pressure. Therefore, I would avoid using propranolol in this situation.\n\nAdditionally, the fact that the child has Tetralogy of Fallot and develops a cyanotic spell initiated by crying suggests that they have a significant outflow tract obstruction, which is not well addressed by propranolol's mechanism of action.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
