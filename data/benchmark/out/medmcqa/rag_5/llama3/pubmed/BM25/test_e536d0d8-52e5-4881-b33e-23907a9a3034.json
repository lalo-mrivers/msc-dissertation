["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the usual radiographic appearance of osteosarcoma. After reviewing the relevant documents, I found that none of the documents mention a 'sunburst pattern with radiopaque strands extending from the cortical plates' (option C) or a 'cotton wool appearance with an irregular peripheral border' (option D). This narrows down the options to A and B. Roentgen recognition of enlarged hilar lymph nodes does not provide information about osteosarcoma, so we can rule out option B. However, one of the documents (Osteogenic sarcoma after the age of 50: a radiographic evaluation) mentions that the radiographic features are similar to those in younger individuals. Therefore, it is unlikely that the usual radiographic appearance of an osteosarcoma would be a 'discrete radiolucency with regular borders' (option A).\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
