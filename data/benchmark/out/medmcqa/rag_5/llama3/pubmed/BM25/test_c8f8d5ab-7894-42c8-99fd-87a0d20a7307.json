["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the marginal ridge relationships on a specific premolar. The provided documents mention nothing about the size or shape of the mesial and distal marginal ridges of different premolars. However, one document mentions that the orthodontically treated group had a significantly higher percentage of even marginal ridges in the teeth that are customarily banded. This could be related to the question but it's not directly applicable. The other documents discuss topics such as proximal contact relationships, marginal adaptation of amalgam restorations, and microleakage of indirect inlays. None of these topics appear relevant to the question.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
