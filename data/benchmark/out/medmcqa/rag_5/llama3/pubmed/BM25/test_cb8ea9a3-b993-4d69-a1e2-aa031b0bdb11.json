["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the steepest cusp. After reviewing the documents, it is clear that the document 'Cusp size sexual dimorphism, and the heritability of maxillary molar cusp size in twins' provides information on the hierarchy of cusp sizes. According to this document, the mesiolingual cusp is largest, followed by the distobuccal cusp, then the mesiobuccal cusp, and finally the distolingual cusp is smallest. Therefore, the steepest cusp can be inferred as the largest cusp.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
