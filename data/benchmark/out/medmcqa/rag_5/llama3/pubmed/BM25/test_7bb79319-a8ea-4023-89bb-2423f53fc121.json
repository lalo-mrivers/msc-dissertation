["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about structures that may be damaged during surgical excision of the parotid gland. Reviewing the documents, we can see that fibrous histiocytomas and hemangiomas are benign lesions that usually do not require surgical intervention, but in some cases, a wide local excision without sacrificing important structures is the treatment of choice. The document on parotid gland tumors mentions that facial nerve was saved in all cases where resection of the parotid gland was performed, which implies that the facial nerve is an important structure to preserve during surgical excision. Additionally, auriculotemporal nerve is a branch of the mandibular division of the trigeminal nerve and supplies the parotid gland. Therefore, it's possible that this nerve may be damaged during surgery. Considering these points, the most likely answer is B: Facial nerve and auriculotemporal nerve.\", \"answer_choice\": B}"]
