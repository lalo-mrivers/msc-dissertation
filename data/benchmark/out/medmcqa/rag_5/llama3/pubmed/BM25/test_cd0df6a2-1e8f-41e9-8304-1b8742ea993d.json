["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about an anti-epileptic drug that is not associated with congenital malformations when used in pregnant women. The provided documents do not contain direct information on the specific drugs mentioned as options (Phenytoin, Phenobarbitone, Carbamazepine, and Valproate). However, they do provide information on isotretinoin exposure during pregnancy being associated with a high risk of major fetal malformations. Therefore, we can infer that this information is relevant to the question.\n\nThe only conclusion we can draw from the provided documents is that isotretinoin is a drug with a high risk of congenital malformations when used in pregnant women. The other options (Phenytoin, Phenobarbitone, Carbamazepine, and Valproate) are not mentioned in the documents.\n\nBased on this information, we cannot make a definitive statement about the specific anti-epileptic drug that is not associated with congenital malformations when used in pregnant women. However, we can infer that any of the four options (Phenytoin, Phenobarbitone, Carbamazepine, and Valproate) might be safe to use in pregnancy.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
