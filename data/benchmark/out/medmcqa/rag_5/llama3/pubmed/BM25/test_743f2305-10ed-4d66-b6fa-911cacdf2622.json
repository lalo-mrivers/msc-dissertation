["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about which type of Hb (hemoglobin) is not affected by Rh isoimmunisation. The relevant documents mention the presence of Hb F (fetal hemoglobin), Hb A, and Hb A2 in different contexts. In one document, it is mentioned that in beta-thalassemia heterozygotes, there is an increase in percentage of Hb A2 and normal or mildly increased Hb F. This suggests that Hb A2 and Hb F are affected by Rh isoimmunisation. The other options, such as Anti C, Anti E, and Anti Lewis, do not appear to be directly related to the question. However, the document on Rh isoimmunization during pregnancy does mention the presence of different types of hemoglobin, including Hb A. This suggests that Hb A is also affected by Rh isoimmunisation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
