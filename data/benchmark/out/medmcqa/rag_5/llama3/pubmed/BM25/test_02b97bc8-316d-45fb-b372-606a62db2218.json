["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The passage describes the metabolism of vitamin D. The first step is the conversion of vitamin D3 to 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 in the liver. Then, this metabolite can be further converted to either 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 or 24,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 in the kidneys. The latter conversions are regulated by serum calcium through the parathyroid gland system and serum inorganic phosphorus concentration. Based on this information, option C is incorrect because there is no mention of daily requirement for vitamin D in the absence of sunlight. Options A, B, and D are all supported by the passage.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"]
