["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The thermic effect of food is compared in various studies. In the first study, it is found that the ingestion of an isocaloric load of amino acids induced a small thermic effect (4.4% of the energy content of the load in 2 h). This suggests that a significant part of the load is not metabolised or channeled into protein synthesis. In term infants, the weak thermic effect after amino acid and the failure of glucose and lipid to stimulate metabolism may possibly be analogous to the lack of post-prandial thermic effect reported in non-growing children suffering from malnutrition. Therefore, there is no stimulation of energy expenditure to produce a thermic effect.\\n\\nIn the second study, it is found that the TEF was 8.2 +/- 0.50% for obese subjects, and remained unchanged after weight loss (P = 0.341). This suggests that the lower TEF in the obese subjects is uncorrected by weight loss, and thus it is a contributor to obesity rather than a consequence of obesity.\\n\\nIn the third study, separate and sequential effects of exercise and meal ingestion on energy expenditure are examined. It is found that there was no interactive thermic effect from the exercise-food sequence above the thermic effect of the meal alone.\", \n\"answer_choice\": B"]
