["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the first document, 'Very low density lipoproteins in normal and cholesterol-fed rabbits', we can see that VLDL were labelled with 125I in the protein moieties and injected into normal and hypercholesteremic (h.c.) animals. This suggests that VLDL is synthesized in the liver or gut. However, from the second document, 'Effect of coenzyme A on triglyceride and very-low-density lipoproteins secretion in cultured rat hepatocytes', we can see that exogenous CoA decreases plasma VLDL concentration because it reduces VLDL secretion by the hepatocytes. This suggests that VLDL is synthesized primarily in the liver.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
