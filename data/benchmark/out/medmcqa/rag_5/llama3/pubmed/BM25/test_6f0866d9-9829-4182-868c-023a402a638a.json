["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, I will analyze each option to determine which one is the most outer covering of nerve fibres. A: Neurolemma is a layer of Schwann cells that surrounds peripheral nerves, but it's not the outermost covering. B: Perineurium is the connective tissue sheath that surrounds nerve bundles and separates them from the epineurial connective tissue. C: Axolemma is the plasma membrane of the axon, which is the core of a nerve fibre. D: Myelin sheath is a layer of insulating material wrapped around the axon by Schwann cells in peripheral nerves.\n\nAfter analyzing each option, I conclude that B: Perineurium is the most outer covering of nerve fibres.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
