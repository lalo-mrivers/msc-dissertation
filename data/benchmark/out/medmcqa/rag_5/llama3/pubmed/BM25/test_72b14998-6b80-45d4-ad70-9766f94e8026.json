["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The document describes the mechanism of iron transport across the blood-brain barrier. It does not mention the entry of iron into enterocytes. However, another document describes an intracellular transit iron pool where iron which has crossed the cell membrane and has been released from transferrin enters a labile intermediate pool. This suggests that iron may enter enterocytes through a process involving transferrin.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
