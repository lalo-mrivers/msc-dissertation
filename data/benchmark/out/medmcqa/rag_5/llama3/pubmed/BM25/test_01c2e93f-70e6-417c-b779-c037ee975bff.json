["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the release of synaptic vesicle from presynaptic terminal. The relevant information comes from the 'In vitro binding of isolated synaptic vesicles to presynaptic plasma membranes' document. It states that synaptic vesicles bind to presynaptic plasma membranes in the presence of Ca2+ and ATP, and this binding is stimulated by protein kinase C and Ca2+. Therefore, inhibition of calcium influx could be a factor in preventing the release of synaptic vesicle from presynaptic terminal.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
