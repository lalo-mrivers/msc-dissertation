["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents are about the sonic velocity and attenuation in wet compact cow femur for different frequency ranges. The first document mentions the frequency range of 5 to 100 MHz. Another document discusses the use of ultrasonics in endodontics, which implies a frequency range not specified but likely within the audible range (20,000-30,000 Hz). No information is provided about the frequency range used in the other documents. Therefore, the correct answer is based on the first document.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: 10,000 Hz\"\n}"]
