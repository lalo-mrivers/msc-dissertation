["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents discuss different types of cell junctions. Gap junctions are mentioned in the first document as being present in mouse salivary gland acinar cells, allowing for direct passage of small ions and molecules between cells. Cytoplasmic bridges are also discussed, but these seem to be specific to insect cells (document 3). Desmosomes and hemidesmosomes are mentioned in document 4, but these are different types of junctions not directly related to the exchange of cytoplasmic molecules.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
