["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with hand wringing, stereotype movements, impaired language and communication development, breath holding spells, poor social skills, and deceleration of head growth after 6 months of age. The first case report describes a child with cataract, esotropia, nystagmus, malnutrition, micromelia, contracture, and profound mental retardation, which resembles the patient's symptoms. Additionally, both cases have consanguinity in their family history. The second case report describes dissociation of motor development, characterized by dissociation of maturity between the upper and lower extremities, which is not relevant to this patient's presentation.
