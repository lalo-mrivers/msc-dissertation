["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the PHP-M (Personal Hygiene Performance Modified) scoring system for oral hygiene. The document 'An oral hygiene measurement system for possible research and clinical use.' describes this system. According to this document, the examiner subjectivity is reduced by scoring tooth surfaces as clean (0) or dirty (1), determining a percentage of \\\"dirty\\\" surfaces which then becomes the Hygiene Analysis Index. This suggests that each tooth surface is scored separately. Therefore, it's unlikely that only six teeth are selected for scoring.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
