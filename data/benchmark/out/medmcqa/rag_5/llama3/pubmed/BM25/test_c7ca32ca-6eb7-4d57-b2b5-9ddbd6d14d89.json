["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the relationship between Adhesive and Adherent. The relevant document is 'A model for the recruitment of neutrophils at sites of inflammation.' According to this document, adhesive glycoproteins on both neutrophils and vascular endothelial cells mediate adhesive interaction between the two cell types. This means that Adhesive and Adherent are interacting with each other. However, the question asks about the angle between them being zero degrees, which indicates that they are tangent to each other, not just interacting.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"]
