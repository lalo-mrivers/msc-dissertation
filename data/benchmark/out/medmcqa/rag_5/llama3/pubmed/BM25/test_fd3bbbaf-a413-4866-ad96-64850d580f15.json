["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, we know that GTR is a treatment principle that involves placing a physical barrier to exclude undesirable types of tissue. In the document 'Use of a collagen barrier to enhance healing in human periodontal furcation defects', it is mentioned that resorbable collagen barriers were used to treat Class II function invasions. This suggests that collagen-based materials can be used as resorbable GTR barriers.\n\nIn the document 'Guided tissue regeneration and GTAM for periodontal regenerative therapy, ridge augmentation and dental implantology', it is stated that successful results can be achieved around periodontally diseased natural teeth using GTR with correct membrane placement. This implies that not all membranes used in GTR are resorbable.\n\nThe document '[Guided regeneration of the periodontal tissues with resorbable and nonresorbale membranes. I. Clinical evaluation]' compares the results of using resorbable and non-resorbable membranes for guided tissue regeneration therapy. This suggests that both types of membranes can be used in GTR therapy.\n\nGiven this information, we can conclude that all options except one are resorbable GTR materials.\", \n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
