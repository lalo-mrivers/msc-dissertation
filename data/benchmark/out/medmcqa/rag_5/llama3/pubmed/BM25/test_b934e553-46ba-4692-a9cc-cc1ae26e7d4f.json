["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the flow rate of the drug solution, we need to calculate the total amount of the drug needed. Since each ampule contains 200 mg of the drug and we're using 2 ampules, the total amount is 400 mg. We want to make a 250 mL solution, so we can calculate the concentration of the solution by dividing the total amount of the drug (400 mg) by the volume of the solution (250 mL). This gives us a concentration of 1.6 mg/mL. Since we're asked to maintain the patient's BP, we need to deliver the inotrope at a rate that maintains the desired dose. The dose is 10 mcg/kg/min, and since the patient weighs 80 kg, the total dose per minute is 800 mcg (10 mcg/kg * 80 kg). We can calculate the flow rate by dividing the total dose per minute (800 mcg) by the concentration of the solution (1.6 mg/mL), which gives us a flow rate of approximately 12 drops/min.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
