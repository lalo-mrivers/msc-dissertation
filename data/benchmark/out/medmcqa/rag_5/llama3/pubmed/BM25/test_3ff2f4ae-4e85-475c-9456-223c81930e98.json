["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the pattern of enamel prism demineralization. From the given documents, we can see that one of them is related to 'Rate and mechanism of enamel demineralization in situ'. In this document, it is mentioned that for in situ enamel demineralization, the rate-determining step of the demineralization process is the inhibitor-controlled dissolution process at the enamel crystallite surfaces. This suggests that the head and tail of the prisms are not resistant to dissolution, as they are affected by the inhibitor content.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
