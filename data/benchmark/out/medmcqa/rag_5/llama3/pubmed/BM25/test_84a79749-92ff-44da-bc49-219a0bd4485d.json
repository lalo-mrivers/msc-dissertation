["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents provided discuss various properties and characteristics of bacteriocins produced by different bacterial species. Bacteriocins are proteins that exhibit antimicrobial activity against certain bacterial strains. They can be used to type bacteria based on their susceptibility or resistance to these substances. The adsorption of a phage tail-like bacteriocin to isolated lipopolysaccharide of Rhizobium suggests that the receptor activity is necessary for its activity. However, there is no information provided about the role of bacteriocins in adherence of plaque to the tooth surface, their use in therapy of dental caries, or their effect on the growth of other bacteria.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
