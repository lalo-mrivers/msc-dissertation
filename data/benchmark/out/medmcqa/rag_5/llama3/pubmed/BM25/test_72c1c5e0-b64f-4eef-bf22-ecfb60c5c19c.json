["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the relationship between insulin and glucagon. From the provided documents, we know that an imbalance between insulin and glucagon can lead to metabolic derangements, including hyperglycemia. We also see that in diabetes, there is often a prevailing hyperglucagonemia (high plasma IRG values). In contrast, streptozotocin diabetics have characteristically low plasma IRI and high plasma IRG values. This suggests that the IRG:IRI ratio is increased with the progression of diabetes.\n\nWe also see from the document 'Insulin, glucagon, and somatostatin in normal physiology and diabetes mellitus' that insulin deficiency is the primary pathophysiologic disturbance in diabetes, while glucagon may worsen the consequences of insulin lack but is neither sufficient nor necessary for the development of diabetes. This suggests that an imbalance between insulin and glucagon can lead to metabolic derangements.\n\nBased on this information, we can infer that low insulin to glucagon ratio is seen in all of these except...\", \n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
