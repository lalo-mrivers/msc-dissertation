["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for the lower limit of the average IOP that can be expected 95% of times. Since we have a normal distribution with an average (μ) of 30 mm and a standard deviation (σ) of 1.0, we can use the z-score formula to find the value. The z-score is given by (x - μ) / σ, where x is the lower limit of the average IOP that can be expected 95% of times.\n\nWe need to find the z-score corresponding to the 2.5th percentile (since we want to know the value below which 95% of the values lie). Using a standard normal distribution table or calculator, we get the z-score as -1.96.\n\nNow, we can calculate the lower limit of the average IOP that can be expected 95% of times by multiplying the z-score with σ and adding μ: x = -1.96 * 1.0 + 30 = 28\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
