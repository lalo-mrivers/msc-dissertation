["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the document 'Unicystic ameloblastoma: a prognostically distinct entity', we can infer that unicystic ameloblastomas have a lower rate of recurrence compared to multicystic lesions. Additionally, in the document 'Mural ameloblastoma: a review of the literature', it is mentioned that mural ameloblastomas, which are associated with follicular cysts, have a lower frequency of recurrence after simple enucleation compared to ameloblastomas in general.\n\nFrom the document 'Surgical access to multicystic lesions, by sagittal splitting of the lower jaw', we can see that meticulous enucleation is necessary for treating multiloculated cysts due to their high rate of recurrence.\n\nFinally, from the document '[Comparative study of treatment of keratocysts by enucleation, enucleation combined with cryotherapy or fixation of the cyst membrane with Carnoy's solution followed by enucleation: a preliminary report]', we can see that simple enucleation has a higher incidence of recurrence compared to fixation before enucleation.\n\nConsidering all these points, it is likely that the chances of recurrence of multicystic ameloblastoma after surgical enucleation are higher than 10%.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: 18-25%\""]
