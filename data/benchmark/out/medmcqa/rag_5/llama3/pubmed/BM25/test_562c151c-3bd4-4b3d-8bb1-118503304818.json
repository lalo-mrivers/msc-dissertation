["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about endodontically treated posterior teeth being more susceptible to fracture. The provided documents mention that root fracture with dentin-retained posts was observed in some cases, but no significant differences were found between endodontically treated teeth and their contralateral vital pairs in terms of punch shear strength, toughness, hardness, and load to fracture. This suggests that the biomechanical properties of endodontically treated teeth are similar to those of untreated teeth. Therefore, it is unlikely that endodontically treated posterior teeth are more susceptible to fracture due to any specific factor.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
