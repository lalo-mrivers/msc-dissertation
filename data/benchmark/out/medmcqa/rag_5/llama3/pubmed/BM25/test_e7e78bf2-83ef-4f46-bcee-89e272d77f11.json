["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe various aspects of mandibular movement. Analysis of human mandibular movement highlights that lateral jaw motion appears to be prominent during the masticatory phase and throughout the movement cycle. The document 'Mandibular condyle dislocation into the middle cranial fossa' reports a case where strongly limited mandibular movement was observed, but it does not provide information on the mechanism of lateral movement. In contrast, the article 'Positional changes of the mandibular condyle assessed by three-dimensional computed tomography' suggests that 3-D CT is most accurate in detecting inferior condylar movements, while lateral and posterior movements were assessed with less accuracy than the inferior positional changes.\n\nConsidering these findings, it can be inferred that lateral movement of the condyle takes place through a mechanism other than inferior movement. The 'Analysis of human mandibular movement' report suggests that lateral jaw motion is prominent during mastication, which implies that lateral movement of the condyle may occur through contralateral or same side muscles.\n\nBased on this step-by-step thinking and considering the available information, it can be concluded that lateral movement of the condyle takes place primarily due to contraction of the contralateral lateral pterygoid muscle (Option A).\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
