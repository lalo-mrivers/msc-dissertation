["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, specifically 'Anatomical relationship of the mandibular canal to its surrounding structures in mature mandibles', there is no mention of an extra distal root in mandibular first molars. However, it does mention that the mandibular second premolar and second molar are the most likely teeth to be involved in accidental damage to the mandibular canal during root canal therapy. This suggests that the root anatomy of these teeth may be complex. The document 'Mandibular premolar with three root canals--two case reports' mentions the possibility of more than one root canal in lower premolar teeth, but it does not specifically discuss an extra distal root in mandibular first molars.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B\n}"]
