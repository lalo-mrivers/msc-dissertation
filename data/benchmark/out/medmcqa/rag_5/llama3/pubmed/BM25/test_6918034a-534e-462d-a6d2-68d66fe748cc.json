["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about suprasellar cystic mass in children. The relevant document is [Suprasellar granular cell tumor. A case of a suprasellar granular cell tumor, approximately 1.5 cm in diameter, in a 68-year-old woman is described]. This document describes the imaging characteristics of a suprasellar granular cell tumor, which includes a slightly hyperdense suprasellar mass with strong contrast enhancement on computed tomography (CT) and an isointense tumor with non-homogeneous enhancement after intravenous gadolinium diethylene-triamine-pentaacetic acid on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
