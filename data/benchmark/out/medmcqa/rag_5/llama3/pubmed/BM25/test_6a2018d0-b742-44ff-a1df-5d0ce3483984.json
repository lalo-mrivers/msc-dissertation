["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To calculate the sensitivity and specificity of the test, we need to determine the number of true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives. The data provided shows that there are 273 test positive samples with disease and 595 test negative samples without disease. We can calculate the sensitivity by dividing the number of true positives (test positive and diseased) by the sum of true positives and false negatives. Similarly, we can calculate the specificity by dividing the number of true negatives (test negative and non-diseased) by the sum of true negatives and false positives. Based on these calculations, we can determine the sensitivity and specificity of the test.\", \"answer_choice\": A}"]
