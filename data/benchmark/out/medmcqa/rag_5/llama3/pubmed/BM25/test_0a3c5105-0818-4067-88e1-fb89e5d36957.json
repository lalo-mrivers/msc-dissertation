["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the type of prefabricated post preparation system preferred for mandibular molar teeth. We need to analyze the provided documents to determine which option is most relevant. Document 1 describes radiographic appearance of titanium alloy prefabricated posts cemented with different luting materials, but it does not provide information on the type of prefabricated post preparation system used in mandibular molars. Document 2 discusses restoring endodontically treated teeth and mentions various restorative options including prefabricated posts, but it does not specify which type of post preparation system is preferred for mandibular molars. Document 3 compares fatigue life of three core materials under simulated chewing conditions, but it does not provide information on the type of prefabricated post preparation system used in mandibular molars. Document 4 describes an appliance to correct mandibular deviation, which implies that mandibular molars are involved, but it does not provide information on the type of prefabricated post preparation system used. Document 5 discusses furcation morphology relative to periodontal treatment and mentions various types of furcations, including those in mandibular molars, but it does not provide information on the type of prefabricated post preparation system preferred for these teeth. Therefore, based on the provided documents, we cannot determine which type of prefabricated post preparation system is preferred for mandibular molar teeth.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"Not applicable (N/A)\"\n}"]
