["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, I will look at the root canal therapy study. It says that the frequency of curved canals is rather high, averaging 59% in the sample of posterior teeth. The most common localization of the curved canals was found to be at the apical third part (53.9%). Then, I will consider the morphology of perforating cartilage canals in the proximal tibial growth plate of the chick. It does not provide information about accessory canals or their distribution. Next, I will look at the fine structure of the retinal epithelium and tapetum lucidum of the opossum. It describes the structure of the retinal epithelium but does not mention anything about accessory canals. Finally, I will examine Retinal pigment epithelial fine structure in the red-tailed hawk. This study also focuses on the retinal epithelium and does not provide information about accessory canals or their distribution.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
