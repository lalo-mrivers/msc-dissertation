["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents suggest that salbutamol increases blood glucose levels (hyperglycemia) and free fatty acid concentrations. It also causes an increase in heart rate, maximum acceleration of aortic blood flow, and maximum rate of change of left ventricular power. There is no indication of hypoglycemia or tremors as adverse effects. However, it does increase lactic acid levels when high doses are infused. This could potentially lead to adverse effects such as muscle weakness or cardiac issues if not controlled. Nitroprusside was preferred over salbutamol after cardiac operations due to increased myocardial oxygen consumption with salbutamol.\n\nThe study on chronic airflow obstruction shows that salbutamol has a small effect on FEV1, but the overall benefit is likely to be of limited clinical significance.\n\nBased on these findings, it seems that hypokalemia and tachycardia are more relevant adverse effects of salbutamol than hypoglycemia or tremors.\", \"answer_choice\": B}"]
