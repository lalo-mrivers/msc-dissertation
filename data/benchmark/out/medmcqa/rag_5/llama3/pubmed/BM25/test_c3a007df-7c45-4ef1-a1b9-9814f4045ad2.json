["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents describe the microwave processing of denture resins, which provides several advantages over conventional processing methods. In particular, microwave processing reduces processing time to less than 1 hour (Microwave processing of permanent soft denture liners) and allows for equal or better dimensional accuracy (Dimensional accuracy of denture resin cured by microwave energy). Additionally, microwave processing can reduce warpage of the denture base (Microwave processing of permanent soft denture liners). Based on this information, it appears that the microwave method provides an advantage in terms of time savings and dimensional accuracy.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
