["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks which statement about developing a dental radiograph is false. The provided documents are related to dental radiographs, but none of them specifically describe the process of developing a dental radiograph. However, it is known that dental radiographs do not involve chemically precipitating metallic silver, as this would be a description of film development in photography. Similarly, high temperatures would not cause fogging or over-darkening in dental radiography. The statement about sodium thiosulphate containing developer is also true, as this is a common component in photographic developers used for dental radiographs. Finally, the length of time does not directly affect the darkness of a dental radiograph.\", \"answer_choice\": A}"]
