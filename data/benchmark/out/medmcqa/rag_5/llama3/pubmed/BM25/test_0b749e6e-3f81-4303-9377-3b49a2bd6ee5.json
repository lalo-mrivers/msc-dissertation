["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the tooth structure affected by Vit-A deficiency during formation. We need to analyze the provided documents to find the relevant information. In the document 'Dietary supplementation of vitamin E protects heart tissue from exercise-induced oxidant stress', we can see that Vit A (Vit AD) was tested for its inhibitory effects on the mutational specificity of antineoplastic drugs, but it did not show any effect. This suggests that Vit-A deficiency may affect other structures during formation.\n\nIn the document 'Development of the cell contact-mediated accessory function for T-cell proliferation in a human promyelocytic leukaemia cell line, HL-60, by 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3', we can see that Vit-A (Vit AD) is mentioned as one of the vitamins tested for its inhibitory effects on the mutational specificity of antineoplastic drugs, but it did not show any effect. This suggests that Vit-A deficiency may affect other structures during formation.\n\nIn the document 'Comparative clinical studies on 2 toothbrushing methods--Roll and Bass technic', we do not find any information related to Vit-A deficiency or its effects on tooth structure.\n\nIn the document 'The classification of single-rooted, pulpless teeth', we do not find any information related to Vit-A deficiency or its effects on tooth structure.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"]
