["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about anchorage not being applied. We need to find the context where anchorage is used. In the provided documents, we see that anchorage is mentioned as a concept related to orthodontic treatment in 'The use of the occlusogram in planning orthodontic treatment' and again in 'Dental implants coated with isotropic carbon'. Anchorage is also discussed in the context of cell biology in 'Anchorage dependent changes in transport of glucose, adenosine, uridine and leucine in 3T3 cells'. However, in 'Spontaneous extradural haematomas', anchorage refers to the aneurysm of the middle meningeal artery with a small parietal dural angioma. The other options do not seem to be related to this concept.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
