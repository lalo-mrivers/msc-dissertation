["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, glomerular capillaries are responsible for filtering waste products from blood. The oncotic pressure of the fluid leaving the capillaries is indeed greater than that of fluid entering it (because proteins and other substances are being filtered out). Glucose concentration in the capillaries is not explicitly mentioned in any of the documents, but it's unlikely to be different from the glomerular filtrate. Constriction of afferent arteriole does decrease blood flow to the glomerulus. Hematocrit of the fluid leaving the capillaries is likely to be less than that of the fluid entering it (because red blood cells are being filtered out). Therefore, option D is not true.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
