["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Upon reviewing the provided documents, I noticed that none of them explicitly mention 'Calcification' stage of tooth development. However, I can analyze the stages of tooth development mentioned in the documents. In the document 'A radiographic study of rostral tooth development in young Friesian cattle', it mentions that most phases of tooth formation occurred within well-defined limits, but does not specify a 'Calcification' stage. Similarly, in the document 'Deciduous tooth chronology in the mandible of the domestic pig', it describes the stages of tooth development, including bud and cap stages, but again, there is no mention of 'Calcification'. In the document 'Tooth morphogenesis: the role of the innervation during induction and pattern formation', it categorizes odontogenesis into three phases (Initiating events, Histogenetic events, and Cytodifferentiative events), but does not include a 'Calcification' stage. Therefore, I will analyze the options provided.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: Interglobular dentin\"\n}"]
