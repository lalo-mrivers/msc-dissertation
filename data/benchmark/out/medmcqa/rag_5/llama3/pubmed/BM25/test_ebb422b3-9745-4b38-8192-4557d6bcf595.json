The oro-antral fistula is mentioned as a common complication of maxillary sinus surgery, particularly after the extraction of a molar tooth.

This suggests that the treatment of an oro-antral fistula resulting from posterior surgery, such as extraction of a maxillary 3rd molar, may involve procedures similar to those used in oral and maxillofacial surgery. One option is the palatal mucoperiosteal flap, which can be used to close oro-antral fistulas.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
