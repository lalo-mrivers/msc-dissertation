["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Papain is a proteolytic enzyme that breaks down proteins. In this case, we are looking at its effect on IgG molecules. The question asks about the fragments formed after hydrolysis of IgG with papain. We know that papain detaches IgG-sensitized erythrocytes from the monocyte surface by virtue of its proteolytic effect on IgG (from 'Effect of papain on the interaction between human monocytes, erythrocytes, and IgG'). This suggests that papain breaks down IgG into smaller fragments. Based on this information, we can infer that papain hydrolyzes IgG to form Fab and Fc fragments.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A: 1 Fc and 2 Fab fragments\"\n}"]
