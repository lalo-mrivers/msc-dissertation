["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about gutta-percha, and we are given four options. We need to go through the provided documents to find relevant information about gutta-percha. From the documents, we know that gutta-percha points can crack off when inserted in small and curved root canals (Relative rigidity of standardized gutta-percha points). We also know that gutta-percha cones can be affected by moisture and aging (Effect of moisture and aging on gutta-percha), which can cause them to become more pliable. Additionally, we find that different brands of endodontic spreaders have varying diameters compared to corresponding sizes of accessory gutta-percha cones (Evaluation of size variation between endodontic finger spreaders and accessory gutta-percha cones). From these findings, it seems that options A and D are not correct, as there is no mention of the composition or forms of gutta-percha. Option B is also unlikely to be true, as heating can cause gutta-percha to become more pliable due to the plasticizing effect of moisture. Therefore, the only option left is C.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
