["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, we can see that there is no direct mention of chronic pulpal infection of primary molars. However, we can analyze the radiographic studies to identify the first radiographic sign of chronic periodontitis in 14-year-old English schoolchildren and ankylosis of primary molars. According to A SEM investigation on pulpal-periodontal connections in primary teeth, scanning electron microscope proved to be an excellent means of evaluating the pulpal floor where failure of pulp treatment often has its cause. We can also look at a radiographic study of the prevalence of chronic periodontitis in 14-year-old English schoolchildren which reported that 51.5% of children examined had radiographic evidence of chronic periodontitis. Although this is not directly related to pulpal infection, it gives us an idea about the radiographic signs of chronic periodontal disease.\n\nFrom these studies, we can infer that changes in the apical periodontal ligament might be a potential sign of chronic pulpal infection. However, based on the available information, there is no definitive answer regarding the first radiographic sign of chronic pulpal infection of primary molars.\n\nConsidering all the above points, I would recommend choosing option D: Widening of apical periodontal ligament as it seems to be a plausible and relevant choice.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
