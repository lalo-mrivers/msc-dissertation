["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the potential consequences of incorporating an excessive amount of monomer into an acrylic resin mixture. One of the relevant documents is 'Evaluation of the level of residual monomer in acrylic denture base materials having different polymerization properties.' This study found that the residual monomer content ranged from 0.22-0.54%. Another document, 'Wear tests of various combinations of acrylic resin and porcelain were made using a machine which was designed to test materials under conditions similar to those of masticatory function by simulating the loads, sliding distances, and contact times encountered in the human masticatory cycle.' This study showed that when a mild abrasive was incorporated in the system, the acrylic resin vs acrylic resin combination wore almost seven times more than porcelain vs porcelain. These findings suggest that excessive monomer incorporation may lead to increased wear.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
