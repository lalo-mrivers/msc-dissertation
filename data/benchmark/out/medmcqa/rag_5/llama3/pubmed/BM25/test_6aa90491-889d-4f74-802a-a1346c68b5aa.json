["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To find the lower limit of the average that can be expected 95% of times, we need to calculate the confidence interval. The problem statement tells us the mean (30 mm) and standard deviation (1), but not the sample size. However, since we are dealing with a population parameter (mean IOP in glaucoma patients), we can use the z-score method to find the confidence interval. First, we need to determine the critical value for the given confidence level (95%). For a two-tailed test, this is approximately 1.96.\n\nNext, we multiply the standard deviation by the critical value and subtract it from the mean to get the lower limit of the confidence interval: 30 - 1 * 1.96 = 28.14. Since we want to find the average that can be expected 95% of times, we round this value down to 28, which is the correct answer.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
