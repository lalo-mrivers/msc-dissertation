["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"After reviewing the provided documents, I noticed that the role of phospholipase A2 (PLA2) as a mediator between proximal and distal effectors of inflammation is mentioned. Additionally, the study on human monocyte killing of Staphylococcus aureus mentions the modulation of bactericidal activity by cyclic nucleotides such as cAMP and cGMP. Furthermore, the requirement of extracellular complement and immunoglobulin for intracellular killing of micro-organisms by human monocytes is discussed. Finally, the study on cytosolic free calcium's essential role in immunoglobulin G-stimulated intracellular killing of Staphylococcus aureus by human monocytes provides insight into the mechanisms involved. Considering these findings, I deduce that the inflammatory mediator involved in intracellular killing of microbes is... \", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
