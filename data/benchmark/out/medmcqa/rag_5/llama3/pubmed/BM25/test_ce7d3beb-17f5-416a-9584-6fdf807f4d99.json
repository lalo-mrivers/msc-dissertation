["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presented with patchy hair loss without scarring. The scrapings from the scalp showed mild inflammation, peri-follicular hemorrhage and surrounding mild lymphocytic infiltration. This suggests an inflammatory process involved in the alopecia. Loose anagen hair is characterized by a predominance of anagen hair with absence of external root sheaths, which is not consistent with the patient's symptoms. Androgenic alopecia typically presents with gradual thinning and does not have an inflammatory component. Trichotillomania is also unlikely given the presence of peri-follicular hemorrhage and mild lymphocytic infiltration. Given the inflammatory nature of the process and the presence of multiple small broken hairs, the most likely diagnosis is psoriatic alopecia.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
