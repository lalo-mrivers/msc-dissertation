["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the location of the respiratory rhythm generation center. We can refer to the document 'Neural regulation of respiration' which discusses the main respiratory muscles being under both voluntary and involuntary control. The involuntary control arises from rhythmic and non-rhythmic systems located in the brainstem. The medullary respiratory centers are located in the vicinity of the nucleus of the solitary tract (dorsal respiratory group) and the nuclei ambiguus and retroambigualis (ventral respiratory group). Recent studies have associated the classic respiratory centers with specific nuclei in the brainstem, including the pneumotaxic center. The site of generation of eupnic breathing and the mechanism of rhythm generation remain unknown.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
