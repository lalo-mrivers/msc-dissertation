["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking which property the Golgi tendon organ detects. The relevant documents provide information about the contractile properties of motor units and their relationship to the activation of Golgi tendon organs. We can see that there is no correlation between the intensity of discharge of a single tendon organ and the contraction strengths of motor units whose contraction excited the receptor. Instead, it seems that each motor unit contributes one muscle fiber to the receptor capsule, regardless of its contractile strength. This suggests that the Golgi tendon organ detects something other than muscle tension.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A: Muscle Tension\""]
