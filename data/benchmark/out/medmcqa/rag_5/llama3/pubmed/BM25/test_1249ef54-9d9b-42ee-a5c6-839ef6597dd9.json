["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the effectiveness of CHX mouthwash daily use till 2 week for streptococcus mutanus. The relevant documents are related to oral irrigation and mouthwashes, but there is no specific information on the effectiveness of CHX mouthwash for streptococcus mutanus. Therefore, I will analyze the provided options to see if any of them seem reasonable. Option A (14-18 weeks) seems too long a duration for the effect of CHX mouthwash to be effective against streptococcus mutanus. Options B and C (12-14 weeks and 12-16 weeks respectively) are shorter durations, but still seem unlikely as the documents suggest that the effects of using lower concentrations of chlorhexidine digluconate need to be investigated. Option D (12-26 weeks) is too long a duration for CHX mouthwash effect\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
