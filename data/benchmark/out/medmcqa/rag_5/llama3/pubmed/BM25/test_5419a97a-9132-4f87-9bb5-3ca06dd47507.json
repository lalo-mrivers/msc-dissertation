["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The mechanism of acetylcholine (ACh) release is triggered by calcium influx through specific presynaptic Ca2+ channels. The modulation of this calcium influx appears as the main mechanism through which ACh release is regulated. Presynaptic muscarinic receptors can also regulate ACh release, and in one study, it was found that dopamine inhibited the increase in evoked release of ACh induced by oxotremorine (Oxo-T).\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
