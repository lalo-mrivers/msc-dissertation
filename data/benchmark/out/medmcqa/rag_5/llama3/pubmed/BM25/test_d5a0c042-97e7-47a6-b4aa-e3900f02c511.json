["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents discuss the release of mercury vapor from dental amalgam. The study focused on experimental and analytical difficulties associated with measuring intra-oral release of mercury vapor. The findings suggest that the diffusion of mercury atoms inside an amalgam restoration results in the formation of a concentration gradient, which is the rate-determining step for mercury vapor release in the long run. This information suggests that the least amount of mercury required is likely to be related to the type of amalgam used.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: Lathe cut alloy\"\n}"]
