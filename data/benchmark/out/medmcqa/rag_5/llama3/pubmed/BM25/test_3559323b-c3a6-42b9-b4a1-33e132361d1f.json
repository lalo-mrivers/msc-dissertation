["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about numbness on shaving after parotidectomy due to which nerve injury. The relevant documents discuss various types of parotid surgeries, including total and radical parotidectomies, as well as the importance of preserving the facial nerve during these procedures. The discussion also mentions the possibility of injuring other nerves in the area, such as the auriculotemporal or greater auricular nerves.
