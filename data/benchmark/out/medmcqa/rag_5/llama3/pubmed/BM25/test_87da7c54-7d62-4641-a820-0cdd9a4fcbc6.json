["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the most characteristic feature of basal cell carcinoma. Basal cell carcinoma has been described in several documents. One document mentions that cytology can be highly diagnostic for basal cell carcinomas if the technique and preparation are adequate, which suggests that histological features may also be characteristic. Another document compares 200 skin lesions suggestive of basal cell carcinoma by cytology and histology, finding that 2 cases were false-negative and 4 cases were false-positive. This implies that there may be some specific features that distinguish basal cell carcinomas from other tumors. Therefore, I will look at the relevant documents to find the most characteristic feature.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
