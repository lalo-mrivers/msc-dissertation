["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine how many divisions to fill in the 2 ml syringe, we need to calculate how much ceftriaxone is needed per division. The l contains 500 mg/5ml of ceftriaxone, so it contains 100 mg/mL (500mg/5mL). Since the syringe has 10 divisions per mL, each division represents 0.1 mL. We need to calculate how many divisions are required for 180 mg of ceftriaxone. The calculation is: 180 mg / 100 mg/mL = 1.8 mL. Since each division represents 0.1 mL, we can divide the total amount needed by the size of each division to get the number of divisions: 1.8 mL / 0.1 mL/division = 18.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
