["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the approved use of Nimodipine. We need to find the relevant information from the provided documents that mentions Nimodipine or its characteristics. The first document talks about Magnetic Resonance Imaging contrast agents, but it does not mention Nimodipine. The second document discusses a new anticholinesterase drug, and the third document is about Combination therapy with nicardipine and beta-adrenergic blockade for angina pectoris. The fourth document is about Teflon-catheter cannulas for direct carotid angiography, but it does not mention Nimodipine either.\n\nThe only relevant information we can find is in the third document, which talks about nicardipine, a second-generation dihidropyridine calcium antagonist.

Therefore, Nimodipine must be approved for use in one of the categories mentioned.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
