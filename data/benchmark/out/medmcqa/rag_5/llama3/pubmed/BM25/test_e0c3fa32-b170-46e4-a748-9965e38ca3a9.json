["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"There is no information provided about electric resistance between oral mucosa and PDL. The documents discuss topics such as the response of rodent oral mucosa and skin to repeated surface trauma, the prosthesis hygiene index, site-specific expression of collagen I and XII mRNAs in the rat periodontal ligament, effects of essential fatty acid deficiency and carbon tetrachloride-induced liver cirrhosis on oral carcinogenesis in the rat, and tetracycline administration increases protein (presumably procollagen) synthesis and secretion in periodontal ligament fibroblasts of streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats. However, none of these topics relate to electric resistance between oral mucosa and PDL.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
