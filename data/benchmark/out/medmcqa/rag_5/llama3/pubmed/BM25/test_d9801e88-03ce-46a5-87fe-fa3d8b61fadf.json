["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, I need to know that the question is asking for a medication that can reduce glucose levels without injections. Since the patient has a history of pancreatitis, we should avoid medications that can cause or exacerbate pancreatitis. Looking at the documents, there is no mention of pancreatitis-related complications with the provided medication options. Therefore, I will focus on the effectiveness and type of each medication.\\r\\n\\r\\nLiraglutide (A) is an injectable medication, which does not fit our criteria. Sitagliptin (B) is a DPP-4 inhibitor that works orally. Canagliflozin (C) is a SGLT2 inhibitor that also works orally. Pioglitazone (D) is a thiazolidinedione that can cause weight gain, which might be beneficial for the patient due to her morbid obesity.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter considering these points, I think the most suitable medication would be Canagliflozin or Pioglitazone because they are oral medications that do not require injections.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C/D\"\n}"]
