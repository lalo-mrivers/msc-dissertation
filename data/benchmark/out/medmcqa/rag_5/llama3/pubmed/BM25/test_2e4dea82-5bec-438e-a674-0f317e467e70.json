["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the gold standard for evaluation of any obstruction in the nasal pathway. We have to look at the provided documents and see what information they provide. In the first document, we learn that nasal airway resistance was evaluated as a useful technique in the clinical evaluation of nasal obstruction. In the second document, we find that patients with normal nasal airway resistance were reviewed, and it is mentioned that the majority of patients were suffering from vasomotor rhinitis. The third document talks about the determination of eosinophil rate after nasal provocation test in allergic rhinitis diagnosis. Finally, the fourth document discusses inhibition of histamine-induced nasal obstruction by cetirizine in allergic rhinitis and mentions objective measurement of nasal airway resistance by posterior rhinomanometry. All these documents suggest that nasal airway resistance is a useful technique for evaluating nasal obstruction.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
