["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The functions of apoproteins are related to their role in lipid absorption and transport. ApoB is involved in chylomicron formation and its synthesis is sustained during prolonged lipid absorption. ApoA-I and apoA-II are found in high-density lipoproteins (HDL) which are synthesized both in the liver and intestine. The functions of these apoproteins include structuring and stabilizing the lipoprotein particles, regulating translation initiation and stability of other chlorophyll apoproteins. There is no evidence that apoproteins function as enzyme cofactors or inhibitors.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
