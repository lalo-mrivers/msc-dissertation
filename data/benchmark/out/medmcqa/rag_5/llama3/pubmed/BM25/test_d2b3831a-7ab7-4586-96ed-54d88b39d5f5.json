["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"After reviewing the documents, I see that there are no explicit mentions of chlortetracycline. However, I can analyze similar antibiotics like tetracaine hydrochloride. According to the document 'Mechanism of action of tetracaine hydrochloride against Pseudomonas aeruginosa', tetracaine acts by damaging the cell membrane, leading to cellular lysis and leakage of intracellular materials. This suggests that its mechanism of action is related to cell wall permeability. As chlortetracycline is a tetracycline antibiotic, I can infer that it likely has a similar mechanism of action, possibly interfering with cell wall formation or membrane function.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
