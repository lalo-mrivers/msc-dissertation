["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"There are several documents provided that discuss various medical conditions. The question asks for a soft tissue cyst that does not produce any radiographic changes. We can look at the documents to see if there is any mention of such a condition. In the document 'Osgood-Schlatter's disease, an emphasis on soft tissue changes in roentgen diagnosis', it discusses Osgood-Schlatter's disease, which is a well-known entity affecting the adolescent knee. However, this condition does not seem to be related to soft tissue cysts that do not produce radiographic changes. The document 'Bronchogenic cyst: a case report emphasizing the role of magnetic resonance imaging' describes a bronchogenic cyst, but it does not mention any specific type of soft tissue cyst that does not produce radiographic changes. Similarly, the documents 'Ultrasound appearance of myositis ossificans', 'Calcified bodies in popliteal cysts: a characteristic radiographic appearance', and 'Combined radiographic and ultrasonographic approach in diagnosis of renal inflammatory lesions' do not mention any specific type of soft tissue cyst that does not produce radiographic changes. Based on this information, it seems unlikely that there is a specific type of soft tissue cyst that does not produce radiographic changes.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
