["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the provided documents, it is clear that sample size calculation for a prevalence study involves considering multiple factors. The main concern seems to be calculating the necessary number of counts to obtain representative data on the quota of structural components in a sample at a certain confidence interval (95%). Additionally, other studies mention various expressions for sample size calculation based on the power function of McNemar's test or unconditional sample size expressions. None of these explicitly state that significance level is required. Therefore, it can be inferred that the significance level is not necessary for calculating the sample size.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"]
