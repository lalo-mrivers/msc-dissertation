["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, there is no specific mention of fixation period for intrusive luxation injury. However, we can draw some inference from the papers. For instance, [Dislocation of the elbow as a clinical problem with reference to rehabilitation] mentions that the reposition and immobilization in the upper arm longer was performed under total anesthesia, which was removed after three weeks. Similarly, [Bipolar luxation of the clavicle. Apropos of a case] reports a good result with only acromio-clavicular joint reduced and fixed surgically. This implies that fixation period can vary depending on the type of injury and treatment approach.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
