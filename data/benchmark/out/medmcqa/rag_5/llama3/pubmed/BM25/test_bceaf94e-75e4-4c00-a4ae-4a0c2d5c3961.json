["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant document is 'Radiographic assessment of proximal infrabony pocket topography'. According to this document, if the transitional zone decreases in width between the 0degree and -20degrees film, then the bony destruction is greater for the buccal plate. Since we have a buccolingual wide proximal box, we are looking for a wedging method that would indicate a greater bone destruction on the buccal plate. Therefore, based on the provided options, the answer is B: Double wedgging.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
