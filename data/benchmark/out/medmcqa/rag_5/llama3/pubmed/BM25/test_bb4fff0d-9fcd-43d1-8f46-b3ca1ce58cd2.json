["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about an epithelial lining being typically found in all of the following except. We need to look at the documents for clues. The first document talks about cysts in the rat intermediate lobe and describes the epithelial lining of naturally occurring cysts. It mentions that S-100-positive cells are intermingled with glandular cells surrounding the cyst lumen, which suggests that an epithelial lining is present. The second document discusses hyalin material bounding dystrophic calcification in odontogenic cysts, which also implies the presence of an epithelial lining. The third document describes salivary gland tissue found in branchial cleft cysts and talks about the epithelial lining of cervical vesicles, which are thought to be associated with the early development of the glossopharyngeal and vagus nerves. Finally, the fourth document examines the epithelial lining of sinus tracts associated with periapical disease and suggests that this lining is derived from the mucosal epithelium adjacent to the opening of the sinus tract.\n\nBased on these documents, we can conclude that an epithelial lining is typically found in sinuses, cysts, and cervical vesicles. However, it is not mentioned as being typically found in fistulae, aneurismal bone cysts, or keratocytes.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer choice would be D: Keratocytes.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
