["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the characteristic property of an impression compound. The relevant documents mention the use of cellulose acetate paper for impression cytology, tissue conditioning materials for denture reconstruction, and the application of bone wax to the divided sternum for haemostasis.
