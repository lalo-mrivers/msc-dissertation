["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the provided documents, we know that the auditory pathway from peripheral to central starts with the cochlear nucleus. Then, it goes through the inferior colliculus, then the medial geniculate body, and finally ends at the auditory cortex. Therefore, the correct sequence is Cochlear nucleus > Inferior colliculus > Medial geniculate body > Auditory cortex.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
