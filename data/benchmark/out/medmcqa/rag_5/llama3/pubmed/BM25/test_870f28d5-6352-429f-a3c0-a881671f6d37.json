["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, there is no direct information about increased intracranial pressure. However, we can look for related topics that might provide some clues. In the document 'Communicating hydrocephalus following the rupture of intracranial aneurysm (author's transl)', it discusses communicating hydrocephalus and its complications. We can see that high intraventricular pressure is mentioned in acute communicating hydrocephalus, but not specifically about increased intracranial pressure. In another document 'On the pathogenesis of bedsores', we find information about external pressure required to stop skin blood flow, which might be related to increased pressure within the body, but again it's not directly talking about intracranial pressure. Therefore, our step-by-step thinking leads us to conclude that there is no direct information about increased intracranial pressure.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D\n}"]
