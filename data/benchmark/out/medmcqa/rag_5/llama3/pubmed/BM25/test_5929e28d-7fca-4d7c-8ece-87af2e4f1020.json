["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, particularly 'A simple model of crack propagation in dental restorations', it can be inferred that tooth structure cutting is preceded by crack propagation due to tensile forces. This is because the document highlights the role of tensile stresses adjacent to cusp loading in natural teeth and discusses how this might predispose composites to fracture.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: All of the above\"\n}"]
