["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents discuss aneuploidy in various contexts. From the provided information, we can infer that aneuploidy is associated with age-related changes, as seen in [Total aneuploidy and age-related sex chromosome aneuploidy in cultured lymphocytes of normal men and women]. This study suggests that premature centromere division may be a mechanism causing non-disjunction, leading to aneuploidy. Additionally, the text mentions that aneuploidy can occur spontaneously during oogenesis [Spontaneous chromosome aberrations in the oogenesis of laboratory rats].\n\nFurthermore, aneuploidy has been linked to prognosis and progression in certain contexts, such as adrenocortical neoplasms [Flow cytometric analysis of DNA aneuploidy in adrenal tumors]. Specifically, DNA aneuploidy was found to be 100% (2/2) in adrenocortical carcinomas, which had poor prognosis. In contrast, pheochromocytoma showed no correlation between DNA aneuploidy and prognosis.\n\nIn the context of oogenesis, hypoploidy can occur spontaneously at a rate of about 0.8% [Spontaneous chromosome aberrations in the oogenesis of laboratory rats]. This is significantly lower than the rate of spontaneous aneuploidy in mice oogenesis.\n\nLastly, multiparameter DNA flow cytometry suggests that keratoacanthoma, a rapidly growing cutaneous lesion, may be a true neoplasm with aneuploid populations [Multiparameter DNA flow cytometry of keratoacanthoma].\n\nConsidering these findings, we can conclude that aneuploidy is not solely age-related and has implications for prognosis in certain contexts. Therefore, option C is incorrect.\n\nThe correct answer is C: Occurrence of aneuploidy has no relation with the progression of mother's age.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
