["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents describe the effects of Nitroglycerin on various aspects such as left ventricular filling pressure, pulmonary artery pressure, cardiac output, systolic and mean arterial pressures, diastolic pressure, total peripheral resistance, heart rate, regional refractoriness, and regional myocardial blood flow. It is clear that Nitroglycerin primarily affects the venous system by causing venodilation and peripheral venous pooling, which leads to a decrease in pulmonary artery pressure and an increase in cardiac output.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
