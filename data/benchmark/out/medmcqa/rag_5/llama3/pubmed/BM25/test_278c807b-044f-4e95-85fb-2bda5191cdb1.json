["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about mechanical advantage to prevent proximal displacement of the restoration in a MO cavity prepared for an inlay. The relevant document mentions MO type restorations on first molars. Since it's an inlay, we're dealing with a Class II cavity preparation. The aim is to compare two methods for beveling the box margins of small proximal cavity preparations. One method uses a modified EVA-System with a total amplitude reduced to 0.4 mm, while the other method uses an axial margin trimmer. It's mentioned that the new device allowed a significant better finishing of the proximal bevel. This suggests that the MO cavity preparation has parallel walls or occlusal dovetail, which would provide mechanical advantage to prevent proximal displacement of the restoration.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D\n}"]
