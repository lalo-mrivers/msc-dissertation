["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the attachment of the middle constrictor of pharynx. The relevant documents describe the anatomy of the pharynx and its muscles. In 'Pharyngeal constrictors and deglutition (apropos of 4 cases]', it is mentioned that the constrictor muscles of the pharynx were quite clearly entirely responsible for the cases described. This suggests that the attachment of these muscles should be considered. The document 'The pharynx of Caenorhabditis elegans' provides information about the anatomy of the pharynx, including its muscle cells and their attachments. However, it does not specifically mention the middle constrictor. The other documents do not provide relevant information either. Therefore, the answer should be based on general knowledge of human anatomy.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
