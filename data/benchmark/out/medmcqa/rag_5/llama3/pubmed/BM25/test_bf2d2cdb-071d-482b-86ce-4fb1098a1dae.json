["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the muscles involved in mandibular movements. The first document discusses the distortion of kinesthesia induced by vibration of human jaw muscles, mentioning the masseter and depressor muscles. The second document presents a functional classification of muscles determining mandibular movements, grouping them into direct and mediated action on the mandible. This classification does not explicitly mention elevators of the mandible. The third document describes paradox activity of masticatory muscles with brain stem lesions, mentioning trismus and trigeminal motor dyssynergy without specifically discussing elevator muscles. The fourth document studies electromyography of external laryngeal muscles in hypokinetic dysphonia patients, not relevant to mandibular elevators. Finally, the last document analyzes TVR and vibration-induced timing of motor impulses in human jaw elevator muscles. Considering all these documents, we can conclude that only one muscle is explicitly mentioned as an elevator of the mandible: Masseter. The other options are either depressors or do not directly relate to mandibular elevation.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
