["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The problem is asking which finger pair is excluded from the recording of 8 fingers. The information provided mentions 'palm prints of 100 fetuses and palm prints of 8 human neonates' but doesn't specify the exact fingers being recorded. However, we can infer that the recording includes the thumb and at least one other finger. The Hypothenar Hammer Syndrome mention suggests that the affected finger is possibly the hypothenar eminence which is located on the little finger side of the hand. Given this information, it's reasonable to assume that the excluded finger pair might be the ring finger.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
