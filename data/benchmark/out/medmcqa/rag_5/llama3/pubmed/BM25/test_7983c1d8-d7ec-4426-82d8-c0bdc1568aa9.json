["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 9-year-old boy with a lytic lesion on the midshaft tibia. The histopathological examination shows grooved nuclei, giant cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm and fibroblastic proliferation. Based on this information, we can rule out Langerhans cell histiocytosis as it typically presents with a characteristic 'michelin tire' appearance on radiograph. Giant cell tumor is also unlikely due to the age of the patient (typically occurs in adults). Chondroblastoma is another possibility but it usually affects younger patients and has a characteristic 'sunburst' pattern on radiograph. Given the combination of histopathological features and radiographic findings, the most likely diagnosis is Osteoid osteoma.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
