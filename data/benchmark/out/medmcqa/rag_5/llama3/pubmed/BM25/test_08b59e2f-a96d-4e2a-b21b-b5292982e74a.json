["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe various experiments on reinforcement, including morphine-based secondary reinforcement and DRL performance. In one experiment, High Naloxone blocked the morphine-based secondary reinforcement, indicating that negative reinforcement was being used. Similarly, in another study, septal lesions impaired DRL performance by enhancing the reinforcing properties of food, which could be seen as a form of negative reinforcement. The concept of denervation or degeneration of a specific 'trigger system' is also mentioned in the context of Negative Symptomatology. These findings suggest that Negative reinforcement plays a role in shaping behavior.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
