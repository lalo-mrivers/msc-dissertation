["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to the paper [Effect of intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation on regional blood circulation], blood flow is proportional to the radius to the power n, where n is a variable that increases with increase of A and decrease of the applied pressure. Since the radius of the blood vessels has increased by 50%, we need to find the new value of n. According to the paper [The flow of human blood through capillary tubes], as the tube bore is decreased, the Fahraeus-Lindqvist effect decreases N, but this is offset by an increase of the anomalous component, A. This results in an increase of the effective blood viscosity in small vessels and of the peripheral resistance. Since we are increasing the radius, not decreasing it, we can assume that the anomaly component A will also increase. Therefore, n will increase as well. Given this information, we can infer that the rise of blood flow is proportional to the increased value of n.\", \"answer_choice\": C}"]
