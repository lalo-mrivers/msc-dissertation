["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presented with progressive jaundice, pruritus, and clay-colored stools for 2 months. The CT scan revealed dilated main pancreatic duct and common bile duct. This suggests that the obstruction is in the extrahepatic biliary system rather than intrahepatic. The history of waxing and waning of jaundice also supports this conclusion. Considering the other options, chronic pancreatitis would not typically cause jaundice, and periampullary carcinoma could also cause dilated pancreatic ducts, but it's less likely to cause isolated common bile duct obstruction. Therefore, the diagnosis is more likely to be a primary tumor or stricture in the extrahepatic biliary system.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
