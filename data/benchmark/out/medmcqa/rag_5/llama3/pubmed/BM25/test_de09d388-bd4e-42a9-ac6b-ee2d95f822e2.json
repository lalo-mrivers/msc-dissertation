["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The case presented is a blue newborn with cyanosis, oligaemic lung field on X-ray chest, and normal sized heart. Ebstein's anomaly, Pulmonary atresia, Transposition of great arteries, and Tetralogy of fallot are all possibilities considering the symptoms and radiological findings. However, considering the presence of oligaemic lung field, it is likely that the diagnosis is related to respiratory distress. The text 'Neonatal respiratory distress' in one of the documents suggests that infants born with micrognathia and glossoptosis may present as a grave emergency, with recurrent bouts of respiratory distress and cyanosis.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is Micrognathia and Glossoptosis.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
