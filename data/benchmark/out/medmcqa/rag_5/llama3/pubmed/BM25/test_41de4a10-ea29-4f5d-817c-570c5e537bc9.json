["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the documents provided, it is clear that implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs) are used to treat tachyarrhythmias. In the case of a patient who develops shock and has an ICD, it would be crucial to assess the position and integrity of the device. Considering the available options, USG (Ultrasound) is not explicitly mentioned as a method for assessing ICDs in the provided documents. CECT (Computed Tomography Scan) and MRI are imaging modalities that could potentially provide information about the ICD's position and integrity, but they are not specifically mentioned in the context of evaluating the device itself. Plain radiograph is often used to confirm the presence of an ICD or other implanted devices, providing a quick and non-invasive method for assessing the device's position.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
