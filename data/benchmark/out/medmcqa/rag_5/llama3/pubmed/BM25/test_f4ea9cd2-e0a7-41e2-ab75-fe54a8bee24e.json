["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for a subantimicrobial dose of doxycycline. Antimicrobial doses are typically above 100 mg. In the Pharmacokinetics and tolerability of a single oral 600-mg dose of doxycycline document, it states that plasma doxycycline levels remained above 1.35 mumol/L for 48 hours. This suggests that the antimicrobial dose is likely to be above 100 mg. Therefore, we are looking for a subantimicrobial dose which would be below 100 mg.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
