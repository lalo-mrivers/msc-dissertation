["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about how direct bonded orthodontic stainless steel brackets derive retention with composite. The relevant information is from the 'Glass ionomer cements used as bonding materials for metal orthodontic brackets' document, which states that the bond strength was considerably lower for glass ionomer cements (GICs) compared with brackets bonded with a composite resin, at all time intervals studied. This suggests that the retention of stainless steel brackets is due to the chemical interlock between the bracket base and the composite.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
