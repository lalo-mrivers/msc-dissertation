["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the number of vision centers under Vision 2020, a national program for control of blindness. There are no relevant documents that provide direct information on this topic. However, we can make an educated guess based on the context. The papers mentioned various surveys and studies on blindness and low vision, but none of them specifically mention Vision 2020 or the number of vision centers under it. We can infer that Vision 2020 is a national program aimed at controlling blindness, which might involve multiple vision centers. Therefore, we are likely to see a relatively large number of vision centers.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
