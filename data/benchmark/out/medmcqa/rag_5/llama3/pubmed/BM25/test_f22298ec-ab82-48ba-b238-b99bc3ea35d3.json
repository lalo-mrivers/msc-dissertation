["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking what an internal occlusal rest does NOT provide. After reviewing the relevant documents, I see that there are no specific mentions of an internal occlusal rest being used to provide horizontal stabilization, retention, vertical stop or occlusal support. However, one of the articles does mention the importance of indirect retainers in preventing occlusal displacement of the denture base. This suggests that internal occlusal rests may be more related to vertical stop or occlusal support rather than providing horizontal stabilization or retention.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: Occlusal support\""]
