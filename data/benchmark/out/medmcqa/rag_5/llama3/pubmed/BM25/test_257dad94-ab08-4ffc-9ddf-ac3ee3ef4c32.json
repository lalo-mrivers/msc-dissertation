["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents discuss various topics such as postoperative make-up techniques, transcatheter occlusive therapy using isobutyl 2-cyanoacrylate (Bucrylate), the development of chick embryo semilunar heart valves, and the effect of contact area size on enamel and composite wear.
