["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the statements related to polymerization shrinkage of composite. The first statement suggests that polymerization shrinkage is greater if bonded surface area is lesser than unbounded surface area, which is a logical but not supported by any of the provided documents. The second statement mentions that polymerization shrinkage is high if within the enamel margins, which is not mentioned in the documents. The third statement suggests that acid etching and priming will decrease polymerization shrinkage, which is also not mentioned in the documents. The fourth statement states that microleakage can occur because of polymerization shrinkage, which is a known effect of polymerization shrinkage as stated in [The effect of polymerization shrinkage during veneer placement].\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
