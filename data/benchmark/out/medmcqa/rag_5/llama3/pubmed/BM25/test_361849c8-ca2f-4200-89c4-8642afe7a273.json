["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about ADA specification for orthodontic wires. I need to find the relevant information from the provided documents. The document 'Bending deformation studies of orthodontic wires' seems relevant, as it talks about measuring properties of orthodontic wires. The document doesn't specifically mention ADA specification numbers, but it does provide a revised expression for Young's modulus and discusses test span length in determining Young's modulus and flexural yield strength. Since the question is asking for an ADA specification number, I will look for documents that might have provided such information. The document 'Preformed arch wires: reliability of fit' doesn't seem relevant to this specific question. The document 'The burnishability of dental casting alloys' also doesn't provide information on orthodontic wire specifications. Therefore, I will focus on the 'Torsional testing of Canal Master U hand instruments' document. This document talks about ADA specification No. 28 and minimum values for certain parameters, but it's not directly related to orthodontic wires. However, since there are no other relevant documents, I will assume that the information provided is sufficient.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B\n}"]
