["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The Snellen chart is used to measure visual acuity. The largest letter in the Snellen chart is typically an 'E' with a height of about 1/60th of the distance being measured from the eye. Since the distance is 6 meters, we need to calculate the angle subtended by this letter. The angle can be calculated using the formula: Angle = Height of letter / Distance. Substituting the values, we get: Angle = (1/60 * 6) = 3 minutes.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
