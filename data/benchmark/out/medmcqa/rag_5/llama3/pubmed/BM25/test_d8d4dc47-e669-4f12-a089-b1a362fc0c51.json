["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, I will analyze the information related to root resorption of primary teeth. In 'Traumatized primary anterior teeth', it is mentioned that pulp necrosis occurred after injury, but there was no developmental disturbance in the permanent successors. In 'Microscopical aspects of root resorption of human deciduous teeth', it is stated that the pressure exerted by a permanent tooth is the most important factor in the differentiation of odontoclasts and that the extent of lacunar (i.e., active) resorption correlates directly with the resorption rate. These findings suggest that the dental pulp plays an initiating role in resorption from the inner surface of roots.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
