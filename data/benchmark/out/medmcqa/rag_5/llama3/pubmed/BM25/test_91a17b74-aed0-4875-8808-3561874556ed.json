["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks which option is NOT true. I will analyze each option to determine which one does not match the facts.\n\nOption A: Actinomycin D is a monoclonal antibody. This is false, as Actinomycin D is an antibiotic, not a monoclonal antibody (according to relevant medical documents).\n\nOption B: Actinomycin D is not cell-specific but it's cycle-specific. This is true, as Actinomycin D inhibits the synthesis of DNA by binding to double-stranded DNA and is specific to the S phase of the cell cycle.\n\nOption C: Vinblastine is not cell-specific but its a cycle/phase specific. This is true, as Vinblastine binds to microtubules and arrests cells in mitosis (M phase).\n\nOption D: None of above. This cannot be correct since one of the options must be false.\n\nTherefore, the answer choice that is NOT true is A: Actinomycin D is a monoclonal antibody.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
