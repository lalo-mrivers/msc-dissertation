["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe various types of teeth, including natal teeth, supernumerary teeth, and primary and secondary deciduous molars. The case report on the extraction of a completely impacted upper second deciduous molar describes the tooth-like object near the germ of the left second premolar as a supernumerary tooth. A radiographic study of roots in extraction sites explains how different root positions affect postretention results. None of these documents explicitly discuss the characteristics of primary and secondary teeth roots, but they do provide information about tooth development and structure.\n\nThe only relevant document is the case report on the extraction of a completely impacted upper second deciduous molar, which describes the supernumerary tooth. The study does not mention any differences between primary and secondary tooth roots.\n\nTherefore, based on the available information, the answer must be D: None of the above.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
