["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The description of the pulp cross-section is triangular with the base located facially and apex located lingually, and the mesial arm is longer than the distal. This suggests a specific tooth morphology that can be found in the provided documents. The only document that mentions the morphology of maxillary second molars is 'Root canals in one-rooted maxillary second molars.' This document describes the root canal cross-sections as non-circular, which could be characterized as C-shaped, Y-shaped, hourglass-shaped or having a greater faciolingual than mesiodistal extension.
