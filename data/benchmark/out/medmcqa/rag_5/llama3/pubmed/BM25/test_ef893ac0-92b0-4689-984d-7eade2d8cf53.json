["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents discuss the porcelain-fused-to-metal restoration, mentioning factors that affect its fracture resistance. The study on 'Design and technique variables affecting fracture resistance of metal-ceramic restorations' highlights the importance of metal design, proper manipulation of materials during fabrication, and the presence or absence of a metal coating agent in determining the ultimate fracture strength. Another study, 'The effect of corrosive environment on the porcelain-to-metal bond--a fracture mechanics investigation', emphasizes the role of corrosive components of the oral environment in enhancing the growth rate of cracks. This information suggests that factors other than occlusal trauma or improper firing schedule may be contributing to repeated fracture of a porcelain-fused-to-metal restoration.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
