["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the documents, we can identify that pneumococcal vaccines are effective against specific serotypes. The most relevant information is from the 'Serotypes of pneumococci in pneumonia, meningitis and other pneumococcal infections' document which states that types 1, 3, 4, 6, 9, 14, 19, and 23 caused 52% of cases of pneumonia and 67% of cases of meningitis. This information suggests that a vaccine covering these serotypes would be effective in preventing pneumococcal infections.\n\nThe 'Pneumococcal bacteremia in infants and children' document states that 90% of isolates belonged to a group of 11 prevalent serotypes, which were the same serotypes isolated from children with sickle-cell disease. This suggests that a vaccine covering these serotypes would be optimal for use in children.\n\nThe 'Comparison otitis media due to types 3 and 23 Streptococcus pneumoniae in the Chinchilla model' document highlights the importance of considering pneumococcal serotypes when designing vaccines, as the pathogenesis of pneumococcal otitis media differs between serotypes. This information supports the idea that a vaccine covering specific serotypes would be effective.\n\nThe 'Effect of pneumococcal vaccine on morbidity from acute lower respiratory tract infections in Papua New Guinean children' document suggests that vaccine efficacy is dependent on the predominant invading serotypes, age at which children develop immunocompetence to specific vaccine serotypes, and levels of naturally acquired specific immunity already present in children. This information supports the idea that a vaccine covering specific serotypes would be effective.\n\nBased on this step-by-step thinking, we can conclude that a 23-serotype pneumococcal vaccine would be most useful for\", \n\"answer_choice\": \"C: Child less than 2 years\""]
