["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant document is 'The language of touch. A conceptual framework is discussed from which to consider the meaning of touch in nursing research and practice.' The question mentions recording PPS (not specified what PPS refers to) while tilting the face down 30 degrees to touch the sternum. This does not seem related to the given documents, except for 'The language of touch'. Therefore, we can infer that PPS likely refers to a process involving human spatial orientation.

The tilting of the face down 30 degrees might be intended to manipulate the pressure cues on the body surface.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
