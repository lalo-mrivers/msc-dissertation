["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with defective hearing and Rinne's test shows air conduction greater than bone conduction on both sides. This suggests a sensorineural hearing loss, as bone conduction thresholds are higher than air conduction thresholds in normal individuals. The Weber test is lateralized to the right ear, which means that sound is perceived more strongly in the right ear compared to the left ear. Given this information, the next logical step would be to evaluate the patient's bone conduction thresholds further.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
