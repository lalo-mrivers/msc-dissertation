["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to the provided documents, we can see that the ANB angle is dependent on both the SNA and NA to Frankfort horizontal. In a study of 298 schoolchildren, it was demonstrated that the angle ANB is linearly dependent on the angle SNA and NA to Frankfort horizontal. This means that if there is a class II malocclusion, which typically has a decreased SNA angle, we can expect the ANB angle to also be decreased.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
