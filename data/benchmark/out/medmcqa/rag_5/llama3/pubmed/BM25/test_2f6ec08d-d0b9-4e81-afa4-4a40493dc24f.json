["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the relevant documents, particularly 'Surface roughness of composite filling materials', it is mentioned that filler particle size affects polishability. Larger filler particles are associated with improved polishability and wear resistance. This information suggests that increasing the size of filler particles in a composite may lead to improvements in strength.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
