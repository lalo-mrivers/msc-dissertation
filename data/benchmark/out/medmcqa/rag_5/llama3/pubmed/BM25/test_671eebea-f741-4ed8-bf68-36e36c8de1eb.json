["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Noise-induced hearing loss is a common phenomenon associated with exposure to loud sounds. The documents provided describe noise levels and their effects on hearing in various industries, including sheet metal construction and boilermaking. Audiometric examinations showed that workers in these industries had hearing losses, particularly in the 3KHz to 6KHz range. This suggests that the noise-induced hearing loss affects the outer hair cells (OHCs), which are responsible for detecting higher frequency sounds. In addition, temporary threshold shifts were observed after a single eight-hour exposure, indicating that even brief exposure to loud noise can cause damage.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
