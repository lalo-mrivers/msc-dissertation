["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to the document 'The importance of environmental conditions, especially temperature, in the operating room and intensive care ward', it is mentioned that for infants and children, the critical ambient temperature desirable is 24 degree C. This implies that a warmer temperature is required for neonates. Additionally, from another document 'Effect of a low protein diet during pregnancy of the rhesus monkey. II. Physiological adaptation of the infant', it is stated that all infants were kept in incubations equipped with a 'servo' control thermal unit that maintained the infants' skin temperature at 37.0 C (98.6 F). This suggests that a warmer temperature is required for neonates to be kept in. Therefore, based on these findings, it can be inferred that the ideal temperature in delivery room for neonates to be kept in would be a warmer temperature.\", \"answer_choice\": A}"]
