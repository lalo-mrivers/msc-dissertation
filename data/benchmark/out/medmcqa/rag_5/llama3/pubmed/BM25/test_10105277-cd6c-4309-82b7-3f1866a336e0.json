["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the provided documents, we can see that Naloxone causes a very small, if at all, respiratory depression and the respiratory centre answers efficiently to carbon dioxide stimulation. This suggests that an increase in arterial carbon dioxide level would be a strong stimulator of the respiratory centre. Additionally, Cheyne-Stokes rhythms are characterized by rhythmic changes of respiratory phases and pauses which are influenced by sensitivity of the respiratory centre to CO2. Therefore, an increase in arterial carbon dioxide level is likely to stimulate the respiratory centre.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
