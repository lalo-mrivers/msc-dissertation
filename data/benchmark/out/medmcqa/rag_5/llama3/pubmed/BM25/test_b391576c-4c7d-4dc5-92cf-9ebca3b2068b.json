["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the morphology and function of different tissues, including skin, retina, calvaria, and bone. The question is about the most metabolically active layer in the bone, which implies that we should focus on the bone-related documents. Among these, Strontium, lead and nickel incorporation into mouse calvaria in vitro suggests that the bone cells are involved in ionic exchange or secondary mineralization phenomenons independent of their activity, but possibly guided by a metabolically active bone membrane. This implies that the endosteum, which is the inner layer of the bone that faces the marrow cavity, might be the most metabolically active layer.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
