["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Lidocaine is used as an antiarrhythmic agent, anti-seizure medication, and for anesthesia. It's not directly related to dentistry. Therefore, I need to look for information that connects lidocaine to dentistry. The documents mention the use of bolus injections of lidocaine during neuroanesthesia, but there is no specific information about its use in dentistry.
