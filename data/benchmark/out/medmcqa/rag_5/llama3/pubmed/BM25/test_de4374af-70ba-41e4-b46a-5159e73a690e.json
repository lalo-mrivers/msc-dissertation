["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"There is no direct information provided about the transmission of occlusal forces to teeth in full tooth-borne dentures. However, we can look for related studies that provide similar information. The [Longitudinal study on occlusal force distribution in lower distal-extension removable partial dentures with circumferential clasps] mentions that oblique forces applied on a tooth borne unilateral prosthesis cause an increase of 65.5 per cent in abutment teeth displacement compared to forces applied to a more favorable bilateral tooth borne prosthesis. This information is relevant as it suggests that tooth-borne dentures may not transmit all occlusal forces to the teeth, possibly due to uneven distribution of force. The study also mentions that the percentage of resorbing periodontal membrane surface of the socket rose through an increase in occlusal forces induced by an amalgam filling in slight occlusal overbite. This information further suggests that tooth-borne dentures may not transmit all occlusal forces to the teeth.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
