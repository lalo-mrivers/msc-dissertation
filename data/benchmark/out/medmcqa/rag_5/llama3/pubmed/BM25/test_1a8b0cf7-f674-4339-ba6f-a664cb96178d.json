The patient developed perichondritis of the thyroid cartilage. This suggests that the tumor has extended beyond the glottis and into the subglottic region, which is consistent with the features described in the literature (specifically, 'Serial sectioning has proved that the weak spot of the laryngeal framework is the anterior midline as far as early tumor invasion of cartilage and extension of tumor outside the larynx through the cricothyroid membrane is concerned.' and 'A metastatic focus of tumor was observed in one lobe of the thyroid in the glottic-subglottic group.') Therefore, it seems likely that this patient's tumor has spread to the thyroid cartilage.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
