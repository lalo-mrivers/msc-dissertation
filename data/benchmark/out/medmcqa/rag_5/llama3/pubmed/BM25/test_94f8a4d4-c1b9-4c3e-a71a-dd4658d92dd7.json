["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks for an obstructive cause of mouth breathing. I need to read through the provided documents to find any information related to causes of mouth breathing. The first document talks about regional ventilation during tidal breathing and doesn't seem relevant. The second document discusses epiglottis prolapse as a cause of airway obstruction, but it's not directly related to mouth breathing. The third document reviews electrical burns of the mouth in children, which isn't an obstructive cause of mouth breathing either. The fourth document talks about obligatory nasal breathing and its effects on snoring and sleep apnoea, but it doesn't provide information on causes of mouth breathing. The fifth document is about surgery of the tongue and floor of the mouth, which also doesn't seem relevant.\n\nI still need to find an answer among the potential choices A-D. I notice that options B and C are physical characteristics that could potentially affect breathing, but they might not necessarily be obstructive causes of mouth breathing. Option D mentions adenoids, which can cause respiratory obstruction, including mouth breathing. Option A refers to a deviated nasal septum, which is also a common cause of nasal congestion and potential mouth breathing.\n\nHowever, I need to find an answer that is NOT an obstructive cause of mouth breathing. This means that options B and C are out because they could potentially affect breathing in some way. Option D mentions adenoids, which can be an obstructive cause of mouth breathing. And option A refers to a deviated nasal septum, which is also a potential obstructive cause.\n\nI think the correct answer is... \",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
