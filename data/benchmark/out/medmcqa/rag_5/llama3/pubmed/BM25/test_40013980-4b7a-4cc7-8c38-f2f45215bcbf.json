["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the origin of tumor cells in chronic lymphocytic leukemia or small lymphoblastic lymphoma (CLL/SLL). From the provided documents, we can see that the patient with B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) developed a B-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma. The cells from the CLL were typical mature B lymphocytes, whereas the cells from the lymphoblastic lymphoma were immature B cells that expressed CD10, CD20, and HLA-DR markers but not surface Ig or cytoplasmic mu chains, and were negative for terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT). This suggests that the tumor cells in CLL/SLL arise from mature B cells.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
