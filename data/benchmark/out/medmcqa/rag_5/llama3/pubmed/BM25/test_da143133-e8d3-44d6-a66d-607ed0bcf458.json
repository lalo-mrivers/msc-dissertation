["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Upon reviewing the relevant documents, we can see that apheresis is a process of platelet separation from whole blood. In the provided document 'Platelet apheresis with Vivacell BT798 DEA, haemonetics V-50 and PCS-Plus: preparation efficiency and product quality using identical donors', it is mentioned that 20 donors underwent all three procedures. This suggests that the donor was not experiencing any adverse effects from the apheresis process initially. However, in our question, we are told that the donor developed perioral tingling and numbness after the first-time apheresis donation. This could be due to several factors mentioned in the document 'Variation in perioral reflex amplitude prior to lip muscle contraction for speech'. Specifically, it is mentioned that during the reaction time interval, there was a precise mechanical stretch applied at the corner of the mouth to elicit the first component of the perioral reflex. This could have caused temporary changes in the donor's nervous system, leading to the tingling and numbness sensation.\n\nFurthermore, we can rule out options A and C as the low platelet count would not typically cause perioral tingling and numbness, and fluid depletion is not a direct result of apheresis. Option D is the most plausible answer as citrate-based anticoagulant could have caused temporary changes in the donor's nervous system leading to the sensation of perioral tingling and numbness.\n\nTherefore, our step-by-step thinking leads us to conclude that option D: Due to citrate based anticoagulant is the most likely cause for the donor's experience of perioral tingling and numbness.\", \"answer_choice\": D}"]
