["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the characteristics of heart muscle.

None of these documents provide information about the structure or characteristics of heart muscle. Therefore, I will rely on general knowledge of cardiology to answer this question.

Branching is not a characteristic of heart muscle.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
