["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents are Veterans Administration Cooperative Dental Implant Study--comparisons between fixed partial dentures supported by blade-vent implants and removable partial dentures. Part IV: Comparisons of patient satisfaction between two treatment modalities. This study compares treatment assessments made by two groups of patients with Kennedy class I or class II mandibular edentulous conditions, who received either a removable partial denture (RPD) (N = 115) or one or two fixed partial dentures (FPDs), each supported distally by a blade implant (N = 113). Two questionnaires were administered, one at 16 weeks after the implant or RPD insertion and at the 6-month interval and the other at 18, 36, and 60 months. Marked functional improvements were perceived by a large majority of patients in both groups after the insertion of prosthesis. At 6 months, a higher percent of patients with RPDs than those with FPDs found it easy to clean their RPDs and experienced chewing discomfort, restriction of food choices, feeling of insecurity with their RPDs, and difficulty with their pronunciation. The exclusion of assessments by 25 RPD patients, whose treatment was judged to be a failure functionally, made the mean differences between the two treatments statistically significant (p less than 0.05) only for ease of cleaning in favor of the RPD and fewer restrictions of food choices in favor of the FPD group. At 60 months, significant differences between the percents of patients with the most favorable responses occurred for perceptions of eating enjoyment, food particles seldom getting under the removable partial denture, and improvement in social life in favor of the FPD treatment and for the ease of cleaning the removable partial denture in favor of the RPD treatment. The results seem to support superiority of the FPD in terms of patient satisfaction, but not enough to favor this type of prosthesis over the RPD without consideration of other pertinent factors.\", \n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
