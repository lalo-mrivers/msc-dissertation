["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The scenario describes a patient undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy who is found to have a stone in the common bile duct. Preoperative evaluation did not suggest the presence of choledocholithiasis, but intraoperative cholangiography showed the stone. Laparoscopically directed, transperitoneal choledochoscopy was performed by passing a 9.4 F flexible ureteroscope through the cystic duct into the distal common bile duct to visualize and remove the calculus. This suggests that laparoscopic exploration of CBD is possible and effective. The papers reviewed also support the idea that laparoscopic exploration of CBD can be done safely and effectively. Therefore, considering the surgeon's experience with laparoscopic cholecystectomy, it would be ideal for him to do a laparoscopic exploration of CBD and removal of stone.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
