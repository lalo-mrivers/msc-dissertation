["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The concept of modulus of elasticity is explained in several documents. In 'Modulus of elasticity and strength properties of dental cements', the authors define modulus of elasticity as a measure of rigidity or stiffness of the material. This definition is consistent with the context of mechanical properties being discussed. Similarly, in 'Thickness and volume constants and ultrastructural organization of basement membrane (lens capsule)', the authors provide elastic constants including Young's Modulus of elasticity, which measures the stiffness of the material. In this context, modulus of elasticity means rigidity or stiffness of the material.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
