["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the undesirable side effect associated with the use of finger spring to tip the crown of a tooth. The relevant document is 'Optimizing anterior and canine retraction.' According to this document, vertical loops or modified vertical loops are used for canine and anterior tooth retraction. The design and selection of a proper loop or retraction spring should be based on several scientific criteria, including a sufficiently high moment-to-force ratio so that root apices are not displaced mesially or anteriorly. Therefore, the undesirable side effect most commonly associated with the use of finger spring to tip the crown of a tooth is the tendency for the root apex to move in the direction opposite from the crown.\", \"answer_choice\": C}"]
