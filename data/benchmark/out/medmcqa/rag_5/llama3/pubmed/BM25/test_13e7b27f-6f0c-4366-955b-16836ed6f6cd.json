["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the anticoagulant used for electrolyte estimation. We can look at the relevant documents to find the answer. The first document talks about the effects of anticoagulants on blood biochemical values, and it mentions that differences in electrolyte concentrations were not significant when plasma from sodium-heparinized blood was compared with plasma from lithium-heparinized blood. This suggests that both sodium heparin and lithium heparin are used as anticoagulants for electrolyte estimation.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
