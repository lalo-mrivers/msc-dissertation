["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about where chylomicrons are formed. According to the documents, specifically [Electron microscopic study of secretion of chylomicrons in the rat by enterocytes in lymphatic capillary lumen], chylomicrons are secreted from intestinal jejunal cells into the lymphatic capillary lumen through breaks in the basal membrane at intercellular space level and penetration into the lymphatic capillary lumen through open junctions of endothelial cells. This process occurs after a lipid meal, which suggests that chylomicron formation is related to fat digestion and absorption. Therefore, it can be concluded that chylomicrons are formed in the GIT (Gastrointestinal Tract).\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
