["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the height of contour of maxillary canine compared to maxillary central incisor. We can rule out options D and C as they are referring to different teeth. Now we need to look for relevant information in the provided documents that compares or describes the shape, size or features of maxillary central incisors and canines. In the first document 'A comparison of intracanal stresses in a post-restored tooth utilizing the finite element method', there is no direct comparison between maxillary central incisor and canine. The second document 'Influence of the maxillary canine on mandibular fracture' does not provide any information about the shape or height of contour of the maxillary canine compared to the central incisor. The third and fourth documents do not mention anything about maxillary canines. Finally, we can find some information in the fifth document 'Polymorphic aspects of male anthropoid honing premolars', but it is about male anthropoids and does not provide any relevant information for our question.\n\nTherefore, based on the provided documents, we cannot make a conclusion that one height of contour is more or less than another. We need to rely on general knowledge about dentistry and teeth anatomy. The height of contour refers to the highest point of the tooth shape. Maxillary canines are generally more pointed and have a different shape compared to maxillary central incisors, which are more rounded.\n\nSo, in comparison to maxillary central incisor, maxillary canine has a height of contour that is\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
