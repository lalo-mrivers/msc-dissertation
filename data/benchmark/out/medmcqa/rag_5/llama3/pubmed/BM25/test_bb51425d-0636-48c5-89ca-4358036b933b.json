["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the effect of multiple firing on the opaque layer of dental porcelain. From the document [Elastic modulus of dental porcelains by dynamic method (author's transl)], it can be seen that the elastic modulus of various kinds of dental porcelain changes according to temperature of fusing. The highest elastic modulus is at a temperature which is 50-100 degrees C lower than the final firing temperature. This suggests that multiple firing could potentially affect the opacity of the layer, but not necessarily crack or become too smooth.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
