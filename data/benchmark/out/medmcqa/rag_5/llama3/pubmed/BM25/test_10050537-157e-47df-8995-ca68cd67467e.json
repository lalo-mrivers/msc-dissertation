["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking which anti-cholinergic drug doesn't cross the blood brain barrier (BBB) and placenta. From the provided documents, we can see that peptides can cross the BBB by different mechanisms. Dacarbazine (DTIC) and biological response modifiers like Interleukin 2 (Il2) don't cross the BBB. Nitrosoureas like carmustine (BCNU) and semustine (CCNU) have been investigated but didn't illustrate their theorical ability to cross the BBB. Radiotherapy is used as a palliative therapy, and Fotemustine (muphoran) can give a response rate up to 28.2% in patients with cerebral metastases. Propeptide analogs are designed to be enzymatically resistant, cross the BBB readily, and accumulate in areas of the brain rich in opiate receptors. Norpropoxyphene does not cross the blood-brain barrier with the same ease as propoxyphene.\n\nLooking at the potential choices for anti-cholinergic drugs that don't cross the BBB and placenta, we can see that none of them are explicitly stated to be excluded from crossing the BBB or placenta. However, based on our analysis of peptides and other substances that have been investigated in relation to crossing the BBB, we can infer that some anti-cholinergic drugs may not cross the BBB and placenta.\n\nConsidering this, let's analyze each option: A) Glycopyrrolate bromide; B) Hyoscine bromide; C) Hyoscine butylbromide; D) Atropine. None of these options explicitly state that they don't cross the BBB or placenta.\n\nHowever, based on our analysis of peptides and other substances that have been investigated in relation to crossing the BBB, we can infer that some anti-cholinergic drugs may not cross the BBB and placenta.\n\nAtropine is mentioned in one of the provided documents as a biological response modifier. Although it doesn't explicitly state that atropine doesn't cross the BBB or placenta, we can infer from our analysis that this might be possible.\n\nGiven these considerations, our answer choice would be D) Atropine.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
