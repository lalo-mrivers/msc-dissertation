["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about cleft palate, which is a result of failure of paired palatal shelves to fuse in the midline. In vitro study on epithelial-mesenchymal interaction shows that contact between two epithelial-covered surfaces is essential for fusion. Facial development and growth are crucial for cleft lip and palate treatment. Arterial distribution in cleft and non-cleft human palates reveals variations, but no specific information about the cause of cleft palate. The Dubowitz syndrome is a recessive condition with intrauterine and postnatal growth retardation, microcephaly, and characteristic facial appearance, but it doesn't specify the exact cause of cleft palate. Cleft abnormality causes underdevelopment and loss of function, which should be restored through primary surgery and correction of secondary deformities.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
