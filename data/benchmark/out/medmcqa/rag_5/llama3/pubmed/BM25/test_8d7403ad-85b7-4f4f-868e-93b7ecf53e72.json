["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about a marker appearing last in MI. After reviewing the provided documents, we can see that Marker chromosome 14q+ is mentioned as being similar to the specific marker of Burkitt lymphoma, but it's not directly related to myocardial infarction (MI). Therefore, we need to focus on the MI-related documents.\n\nThe first document describes the evolution of meningococcal infection in Mongolia. This doesn't seem relevant to the question either.\n\nThe second document discusses stroke following acute myocardial infarction in diabetics. Although it provides some interesting findings, it's not directly related to the marker appearing last in MI.\n\nThe third document explores mitotic activity of granulopoietic precursor cells in chronic myeloid leukaemia. This doesn't seem relevant to the question either.\n\nThe fourth and final document examines the effects of glucose and parathyroid hormone on the renal handling of myoinositol by isolated perfused dog kidneys. Since MI is not related to this topic, we can disregard it as well.\n\nAfter careful consideration, we realize that none of the provided documents directly address the question about the marker appearing last in MI. Therefore, we cannot choose an option from the given choices.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"None\""]
