["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the effects of lidocaine on various physiological processes. Lidocaine is a commonly used antiarrhythmic agent whose pharmacokinetics have been extensively studied. It inhibits rapid axonal transport by depressing oxidative metabolism, and it also affects mitochondrial respiration. The studies suggest that quinetholate is more potent than lidocaine in reversing ouabain-induced ventricular tachycardia, while procainamide shows no significant effect on cardiac depression. Lidocaine's antiarrhythmic effects are due to its ability to impair mitochondrial metabolism.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
