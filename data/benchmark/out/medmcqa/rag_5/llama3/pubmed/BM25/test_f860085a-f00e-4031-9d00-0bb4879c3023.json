["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking which statement about nasal fractures is false. The first option mentions ecchymosis and facial edema, which is mentioned in the 'Nasal fractures in adults' document as a possible complication of acute nasal fractures. The second option talks about reduction for a few weeks, which aligns with the principle to postpone repair of the nasal injury so the patient can be stabilized and totally evaluated while the surgeon plans and prepares to do the optimum nose operation. The third option states that nasal fractures need not be complicated by traumatic telecanthus, which is supported by the 'A classification of injuries of the nasal skeleton' document as it discusses the different types of fractures based on the pattern of impact and subsequent damage sustained. Finally, the fourth option mentions telescoping of the nasal complex into the frontal sinus, which is discussed in the '[Long-term results of fractured nasal bones in adults]' document as a possible outcome when nasal obstruction deformity slowly develops several months after treatment.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
