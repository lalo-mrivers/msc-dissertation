["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks which of the following has a bifid root. We can analyze each option: A, B, C, and D. The relevant documents mention bifid ribs, bifid ureter, and bifid scrotum. Therefore, we are looking for options that refer to parts of the body that have a bifid structure. Options A, C, and D do not seem to fit this description. Option B mentions 31 and 41 which could potentially be related to bifid ribs (document 1) or bifid nasolabial flaps (document 4). However, since there is no direct connection between these options and the concept of bifid root, we can eliminate them as well. The only option left is D, which refers to hemivertebrae C2-3 and C7-T1. This matches our search criteria because a hemivertebra has a bifid structure.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
