["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Metformin is an oral hypoglycemic drug that increases the initial rate of uptake of 2-deoxyglucose and 3-O-methylglucose. It stimulates hexose transport into differentiated muscle cells by acting at a posttranslational level. Metformin decreases intestinal glucose absorption in a dose-dependent manner by effects on mucosal and serosal glucose transfer. It is excreted unchanged in urine and has been well documented to be effective in maturity-onset diabetes as monotherapy or in combination with a sulphonylurea. However, it inhibits cellular respiration in mitochondria which is not mentioned in the provided documents. The document on Metformin-associated lactic acidosis suggests that metformin should not be prescribed in the presence of renal, hepatic or cardiovascular disease. It does not mention its use in decompensated heart failure. Therefore, option A: Inhibits cellular respiration in mitochondria is true about metformin and all other options are false.\", \"answer_choice\": A}"]
