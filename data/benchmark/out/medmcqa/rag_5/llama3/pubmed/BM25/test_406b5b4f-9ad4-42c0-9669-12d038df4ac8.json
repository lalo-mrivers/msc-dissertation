["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the highest concentration of oxygen delivery. Based on the provided documents, it is clear that face masks can deliver high concentrations of oxygen when used with shielded orifices and at flow rates above 15 litres per minute. The document 'Measurement of intratracheal oxygen concentrations during face mask administration of oxygen' specifically states that using a shielded mask allows for delivery of an inspired oxygen concentration of 100%.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
