["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"None of the provided documents relate to the concept of standardization or comparison between populations. Therefore, it is necessary to consider the general principles of standardization. Direct standardization involves adjusting the age structure of the study population to match that of the standard population by applying age-specific rates from the standard population to the study population. Indirect standardization involves using the age-specific rates from the study population and applying them to the standard population. This allows for comparison between two different populations.\", \"answer_choice\": D}"]
