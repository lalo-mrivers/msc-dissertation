["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks for coarse tremors of the tongue, which is mentioned in one of the provided documents as a symptom. The document 'Carcinoma of the anterior tongue in adolescence' mentions that all five lesions were too advanced to cure and did not seem to be related to any contributory factor. Another document 'Effects of diethylcholine in two animal models of Parkinsonism tremors' discusses tremors caused by physostigmine and carbachol injections, which is a different scenario from what we are looking for in this question. The document 'Anatomical and neurohistological observations on the tongue of 60 mm embryo of opossum, Didelphis marsupialis' is irrelevant to the symptoms asked about in this question. The document 'Lymphangioma of the tongue' discusses a rare tumor that affects the tongue but does not mention coarse tremors. Therefore, we can rule out all possibilities except one.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
