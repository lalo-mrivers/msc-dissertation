["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"I will analyze the provided documents to find the answer. The first document talks about infant and child mortality levels in Ghana, but it does not specify the age of the child used in determining the mortality rate. The second document discusses proximate determinants of child mortality in Liberia, but it also does not provide information on the age of the child. The third document studies the relationship between maternal smoking and child morbidity and mortality up to the age of five, which suggests that the age range is 0-5 years. The fourth document measures child mortality in association with a multipurpose birth certificate programme in Papua New Guinea and does not provide specific information on the age range used. The fifth document analyzes social class differences in child mortality in Sweden during 1981-1986 and uses children younger than 16 years, which suggests that the age range is 0-15 years. However, one of the documents specifically mentions that a large proportion of deaths among children aged 0-4 occur in the second year of life, which is mentioned in the first document. This information points towards an answer of D: 0-1 years.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
