["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Mean and standard deviation are measures of central tendency and variability respectively. They can be calculated from data that follows a specific scale. Nominal scale does not have inherent meaning for these calculations. Dichotomous scale is binary, so it's not suitable either. Ordinal scale allows ranking but no meaningful measurement of intervals. Interval/Ratio scale has inherent zero point and equal interval between units, making it possible to calculate mean and standard deviation.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C\n}"]
