["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"After reviewing the documents, I found that the odontoblastic layer is described as 'odontoblastic processes' in [Electron microscopic demonstration of mitochondria in odontoblastic processes in the rat molar dentin]. This suggests a layered or palisade-like structure. Additionally, the same document states that the larger number of mitochondria in the dentin third next to the pulp explains the finding by other authors of a localized activity of mitrochondrially bound enzymes in this part of the dentin. This implies that there is more than one layer. Therefore, I conclude that the odontoblastic layer appears pseudostratified.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
