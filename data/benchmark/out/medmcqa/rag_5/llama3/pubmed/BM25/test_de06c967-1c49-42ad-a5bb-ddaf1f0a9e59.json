["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the phenomenon of vasomotor reversal of Dale. Vasomotor reversal of Dale refers to the increase in blood pressure after stimulation of alpha-adrenergic receptors followed by stimulation of beta-adrenergic receptors. This phenomenon can be demonstrated in an animal model by blocking the alpha-1 receptor and then stimulating the beta-2 receptor. This is because alpha-1 receptor stimulation causes vasoconstriction, while beta-2 receptor stimulation causes vasodilation.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
