["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about increased VDO (vertical dimension of occlusion). Upon reviewing the documents provided, I did not find any direct connection between increased VDO and the given options. However, one of the studies mentioned in document A discusses the determination of vertical dimension of occlusion in edentulous patients. This study found that the mean VDO with both methods (A and B) was not statistically significantly different from the values of the new dentures. No information is provided about the consequences of increased VDO.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: All of the above\"\n}"]
