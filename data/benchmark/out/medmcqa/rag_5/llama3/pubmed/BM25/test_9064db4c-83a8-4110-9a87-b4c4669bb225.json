["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to the documents provided, metal oxides are formed on the surface of alloys after the degassing process. These oxides can influence the bond strength between alloys and porcelains. In one study, it was found that the adherence strengths of the oxides were greater than the reported cohesive strength of opaque porcelain, indicating that the oxides are sufficiently adherent to their substrates to produce adequate porcelain bonds. Therefore, metal oxides are added to provide bonding between the metal and porcelain.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
