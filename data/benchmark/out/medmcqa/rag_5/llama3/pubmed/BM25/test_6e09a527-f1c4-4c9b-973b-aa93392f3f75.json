["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the relationship between the primary target (a protein) and its secondary target. The secondary target should be a protein as well, with similar or identical properties to allow binding. Considering the context of protein-protein interactions, it's unlikely that the secondary target would have an identical primary structure or binding sites. However, the text doesn't provide specific information about the tissue localization of the secondary target. Based on general knowledge of protein-protein interactions, the secondary target could be present in the same tissue as the primary target.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
