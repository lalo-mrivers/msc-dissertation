["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for complications of supracondylar fracture of humerus in children, except one. We need to identify the correct answer from the options provided. Upon reviewing the relevant documents, we see that Brachial artery thrombosis following prompt reduction of a supracondylar fracture of the humerus can lead to Volkmann's ischemia. This is a serious complication. Percutaneous pinning of displaced supracondylar fractures of the humerus in children has been shown to result in regression within six hours, indicating that some complications may be short-term. Late ulnar nerve injury following Kirschner wires fixation of the supracondylar fracture of the humerus is also reported. Treatment of ipsilateral supracondylar and forearm fractures in children highlights the importance of treating displaced supracondylar fractures with percutaneous pin fixation. The operative management of the difficult supracondylar fracture of the humerus in the child emphasizes that closed manipulation should be used routinely as the method of treatment for supracondylar fractures of the humerus in children, except in the difficult case, for which operative treatment should be undertaken.\n\nBased on this information, we can see that compartment syndrome is a potential complication of supracondylar fracture of humerus in children. Myositis ossificans is also mentioned as a complication in the relevant documents. Malunion and non-union are both possible complications of supracondylar fractures.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
