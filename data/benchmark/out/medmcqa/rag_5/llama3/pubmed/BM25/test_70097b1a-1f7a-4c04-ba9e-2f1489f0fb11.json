["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking to find the average number of dental caries cases reported in a town for the last 10 years. The data provided is a list of numbers: 250, 320, 190, 300, 5000, 100, 260, 350, 320 and 160. First, we need to identify the correct average method to use. Since the data contains outliers (e.g., 5000), the arithmetic mean may not be the best choice. The mode is not relevant here as it's used for categorical data. Median is a better option since it's more robust to outliers. Geometric mean is typically used for proportional or logarithmic data, which is not the case here.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
