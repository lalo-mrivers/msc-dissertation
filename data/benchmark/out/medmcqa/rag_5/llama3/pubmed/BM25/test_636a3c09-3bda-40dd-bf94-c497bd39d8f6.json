["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking which drug is not used in heart failure. The relevant documents do not explicitly mention the use of each drug in heart failure. However, based on the information provided about antiarrhythmic drugs and their negative effects on congestive heart failure (CHF), it can be inferred that disopyramide is an antiarrhythmic drug that may worsen CHF.

Therefore, the answer is likely D: Sacubitril, which is an angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitor used in the treatment of heart failure.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
