["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about Vitamin K's antagonizing effect. Based on the documents provided, we can see that Vitamin K is a substrate for a liver microsomal enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of specific glutamyl residues to gamma-carboxyglutamyl residues in a limited number of proteins. These include the vitamin K-dependent clotting factors: prothrombin (factor II), factor VII, factor IX, and factor X. In the absence of Vitamin K, nonfunctional clotting factors are synthesized and hemorrhage can result.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
