["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, we can start by identifying the relevant information about the frontal paranasal sinus. According to the document 'Radiologic anatomy of the paranasal sinuses in the child', the frontal sinus appears as a triangle at the age of four and oversteps the supraorbital margin at the age of six. This suggests that the frontal sinus is connected to the nasal cavity.\n\nThe same document also mentions that the paranasal or accessory nasal sinuses begin their development as evaginations of the mucosa during the 3rd and 4th fetal months, but undergo their major expansion after birth according to the development of the facial cranium and the teeth. This implies that the frontal sinus is part of a larger network of sinuses that drain into the nasal cavity.\n\nAnother relevant document is 'Nasal cavities and paranasal sinuses in newborns and children', which describes how the paranasal or accessory nasal sinuses begin their development as evaginations of the mucosa during the 3rd and 4th fetal months. This suggests that the frontal sinus is part of a larger network of sinuses that drain into the nasal cavity.\n\nFinally, we can look at the document 'Ophthalmic complications in patients with paranasal sinus mucopyoceles', which mentions that ophthalmic signs and symptoms included lid swelling, ocular pain, pseudoptosis, proptosis, displacement of the eyeball, epiphora, slightly blurred vision, severely decreased visual acuity, visual field abnormality, diplopia, disk edema, retinoichoroidal folds, and increased intraocular pressure. None of these symptoms suggest that the frontal sinus drains into any of the options provided.\n\nTherefore, based on all available information, it is most likely that the frontal paranasal sinus drains into\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
