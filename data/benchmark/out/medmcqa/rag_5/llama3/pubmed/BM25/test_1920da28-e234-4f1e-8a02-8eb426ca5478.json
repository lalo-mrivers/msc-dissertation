["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the function of molybdenum in base metal alloys. None of the provided documents explicitly mention the role of molybdenum in these alloys. However, we can look for clues and information that might help us answer this question. The documents do not provide any specific data on the strength of base metal alloys with or without molybdenum. They also do not discuss the effect of molybdenum on corrosion resistance. There is no mention of CTP (what is this?) in the provided texts. Based on the information, we can infer that molybdenum might be present in some base metal alloys, but its function remains unknown.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
