["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about which teeth are least involved in periodontitis. After reviewing the provided documents, we can see that there is a study about root retention in maxillary molars with furcation involvement. This study suggests that considerable emphasis was placed on improving occlusal function and no case had root amputation, hemisection, osseous surgery, or reshaping of the cervical area of the tooth done. This implies that the focus was on preserving the periodontium of these teeth. In another document, we can see a study about orthodontic movement in previously avulsed teeth and partially avulsed teeth. The results show that apical root resorption does occur more readily in these teeth before, during, and after orthodontic treatment. This implies that the focus was on preserving the tooth structure rather than the periodontium. Therefore, we can infer that the teeth least involved in periodontitis are those mentioned in the study about odontodysplasia, which does not mention periodontitis or any related condition.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
