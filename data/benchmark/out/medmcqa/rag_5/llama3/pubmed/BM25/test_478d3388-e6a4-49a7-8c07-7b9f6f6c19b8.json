["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"After reviewing the provided documents, I noticed that none of them specifically mention 'stopko tip irrigation' or its application in cleaning and drying the pulp chamber. However, one document does discuss vitreous surgery and instrumentation for vitrectomy. Although this is not directly related to the pulp chamber, it can be inferred that a similar approach might be used for irrigation in dentistry. According to [Reactions of the pulp-dentin system to drugs], hydrogen peroxide should not be used for cleaning cavities due to its potential inflammatory reaction and irreversible capillary stases. This suggests that a gentler solution might be preferred for cleaning and drying the pulp chamber.\n\nConsidering these points, I will choose an option that does not involve hydrogen peroxide. Option B: 95% alcohol + 17% EDTA seems like a more suitable choice for cleaning and drying the pulp chamber.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
