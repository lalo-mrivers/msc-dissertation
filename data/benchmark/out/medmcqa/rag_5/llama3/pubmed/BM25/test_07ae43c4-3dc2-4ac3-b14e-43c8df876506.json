["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"There are no relevant documents provided that mention blood glucose or anticoagulants used for its measurement. The documents provided discuss pH and blood gas analysis, indirect immunofluorescence test, control of oral anticoagulation in patients using long-term internal jugular catheters, a technique for multiple, high-rate blood samplings via an external cannula in rats, and direct determination of cadmium and lead in whole blood by potentiometric stripping analysis. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the anticoagulant used to send the blood sample for blood glucose measurement.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"\"\n}"]
