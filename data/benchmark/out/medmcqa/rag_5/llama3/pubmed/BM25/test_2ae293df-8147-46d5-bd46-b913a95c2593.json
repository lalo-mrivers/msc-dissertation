["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with amblyopia, exeional chest pain, episodic tachycardia, and extra systoles on FCC. The symptoms of chest pain and tachycardia suggest a cardiac issue. The patient's age is 70 years old, which makes him more likely to have underlying cardiovascular conditions. The absence of other symptoms such as abdominal pain, obstruction, or palpable lump in the case report of Leiomyoblastoma of the stomach suggests that this condition is unlikely. The presence of episodic tachycardia and extra systoles on FCC suggests a cardiac arrhythmia.\n\nThe case reports suggest that ventricular tachycardia can be induced by esophageal stimulation, which raises the possibility of a similar arrhythmic condition in this patient. Additionally, the report on Mitral valve prolapse mentions the association with life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias. Considering these points, it is likely that the patient's symptoms are related to cardiac arrhythmia.\n\nThe options provided do not seem to have any clear relation to the patient's symptoms and medical history. Therefore, it is most likely that the probable cause of the patient's symptoms is a cardiac arrhythmic condition, such as ventricular tachycardia.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
