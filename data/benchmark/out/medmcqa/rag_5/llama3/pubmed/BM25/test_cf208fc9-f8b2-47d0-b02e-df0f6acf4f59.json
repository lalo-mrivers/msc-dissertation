["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, we can start by analyzing the ultrastructure of the red pulp in the spleen. In the pig, smooth-muscle cells were present, and nerve fibres terminated around these cells. In the horse, no smooth-muscle cells were found, but nerve fibres terminated around reticular cells. This suggests that the presence or absence of smooth-muscle cells might be relevant to our question.\n\nNext, let's look at the study on calcitonin gene-related peptide containing sensory neurons. The study showed that different subgroups of CGRP-IR neurons innervate the buccal mucosa and incisor tooth pulp. This suggests that these two oral tissues are innervated by distinct types of nerve fibres.\n\nNow, let's examine the localization of substance P-like immunoreactivity in nerves in the tooth pulp. The study found that SP-positive fibres were present throughout the dental pulp, including near odontoblasts and blood vessels. This suggests that these fibres may be involved in pain transmission.\n\nFinally, let's look at the activation of sympathetic fibres in the pulp by electrical stimulation of rat incisor teeth. The study showed that sympathetic nerve stimulation induced a frequency-dependent reduction followed by an increase in pulpal blood flow, which was blocked by alpha-adrenoceptor antagonists and enhanced by beta-adrenoceptor antagonists. This suggests that there are sympathetic nerve fibres present in the rat incisor pulp.\n\nBased on these findings, it seems likely that the nerve fibres in the pulp are a combination of autonomic parasympathetic and sympathetic fibres.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: Both autonomic parasympathetic and sympathetic fibres\""]
