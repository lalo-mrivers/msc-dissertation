["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant document for this question is 'Occlusion and Orthodontics'. In this document, it discusses the importance of an ideal occlusion and its relationship to centric relation and centric occlusion. The text states that there should be no slide in centric; that is, there should be a stable jaw relationship when occlusal contact is made in centric relation closure. This means that the mandible should not move anteriorly or posteriorly during this position. Therefore, to remove centric interference, we need to reduce the amount of movement between centric relation and centric occlusion.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
