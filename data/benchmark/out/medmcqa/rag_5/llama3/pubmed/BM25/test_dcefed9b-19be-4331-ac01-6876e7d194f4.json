["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the bacteria responsible for the progression of dental caries. The relevant documents mention salivary diagnostics and tests for estimating caries activity due to bad dietary habits (salivary lactobacilli) and establishing the presence of infection (salivary mutans streptococci). This suggests that the bacteria causing caries are present in the saliva. The document on sugar substitutes also mentions the use of non-fermentable sweeteners, which implies that fermentation by certain bacteria may be involved in dental caries progression.\", \"answer_choice\": B}"]
