["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about indirect retention. There are multiple documents provided, but none of them directly relate to indirect retention. However, one document talks about 'retention' in the context of prosthetic retention, which seems to be a different topic. Another document discusses retention in the context of bone osteotomy, which is also not relevant to this question. The only remaining document that might be relevant is the update on nitrate tolerance, where it mentions 'retention' in the context of sodium and water retention. This could be related to indirect retention, but it's unclear without further information. Based on this analysis, it seems unlikely that any of these documents directly relate to indirect retention.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
