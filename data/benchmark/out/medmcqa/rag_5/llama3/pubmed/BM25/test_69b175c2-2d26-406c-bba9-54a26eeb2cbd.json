["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the type of dense fibrous connective tissue that holds bones together. From the provided documents, we can see that the first document discusses spinal cord transection and the formation of a scar matrix. The second document talks about the healing response to TGF-beta 1 in skull defects. The third document examines the structure of capsules around breast prostheses. None of these documents specifically discuss bone structures or types of connective tissue that hold bones together.
