["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the provided documents, we can see that wetting properties are related to contact angles. The document 'Permeability and wetting properties of four cavity liners' states that S.S. White liner has a good wetting property with a low contact angle. On the other hand, Copalite has poor wetting properties with a high contact angle. Therefore, we can conclude that for effective wetting, a bonding agent should have a minimum contact angle.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A: Minimum with dental hard tissue\"\n}"]
