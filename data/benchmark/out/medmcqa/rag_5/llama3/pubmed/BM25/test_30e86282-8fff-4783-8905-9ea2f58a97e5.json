["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the type of Hodgkin's lymphoma where lacunar cells are seen. We can look at the second document, 'Lacunar cells of nodular sclerosing Hodgkin's disease: an ultrastructural and immunohistologic study'. This document discusses the findings in 22 cases of nodular sclerosing Hodgkin's disease. It mentions the presence of lacunar cells and suggests that these cells may be a part of a developmental sequence from lymphocyte to transformed lymphocyte to the abnormal mononuclear Hodgkin's cell, with further progression to the diagnostic Reed-Sternberg cell. Therefore, based on this document, we can conclude that lacunar cells are seen in Nodular sclerosing Hodgkin's disease.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
