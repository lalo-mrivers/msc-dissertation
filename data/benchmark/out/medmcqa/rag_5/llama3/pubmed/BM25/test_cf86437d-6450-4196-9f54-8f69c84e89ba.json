["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking why stress breakers are not used in partial denture construction. We can look at the provided documents for answers. None of the documents mention stress breakers or their usage in partial denture construction. However, we do see discussions about stress and its effects on surrounding bone in the 'Analysis of stress on a fixed partial denture with a blade-vent implant abutment' document. This suggests that stress management is important in partial denture construction, but it doesn't provide information on why stress breakers are not used. The other documents appear to be discussing different topics, such as provisional removable partial dentures or expert systems for treatment planning. Therefore, the answer must come from one of the potential choices provided.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D\n}"]
