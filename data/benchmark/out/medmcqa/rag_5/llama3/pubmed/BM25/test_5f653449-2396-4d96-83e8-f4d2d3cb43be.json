["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the process of transferring information from RNA to proteins. From the given documents, it can be inferred that amino acids were attached directly to the 'messenger' RNA along the backbone as 2'OH aminoacyl esters in an early form of translating. This means that the amino acids were covalently linked to the RNA without the use of tRNA's and ribosomes. Therefore, the process of transferring information from RNA to proteins is called Translation.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
