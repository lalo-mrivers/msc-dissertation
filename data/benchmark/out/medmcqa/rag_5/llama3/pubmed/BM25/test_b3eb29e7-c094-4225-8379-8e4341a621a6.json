["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has fever, headache, and neck stiffness. The CSF analysis shows a glucose level of 55 mg/dl, which is slightly elevated but still within the normal range. Protein levels are also normal at 0.50 g/L. ICT is mildly elevated at 35 cmH2O, but this could be due to various reasons including meningeal irritation.
