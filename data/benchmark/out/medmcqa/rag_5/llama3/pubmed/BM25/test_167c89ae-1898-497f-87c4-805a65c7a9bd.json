["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"There are no relevant documents provided that directly relate to the topic of supporting cusps occluding. However, we can look for any mention of occlusion or blocking in the provided texts. In the first document, Bucrylate is mentioned as being used effectively to occlude vessels with very slow flow, occlude high flow arteriovenous fistulas, and produce permanent vessel obliteration. This suggests that occlusion can occur at different levels of blood flow. The second document talks about the development of semilunar heart valves in chick embryos, but does not mention supporting cusps or occlusion. The third document discusses the wear of composite specimens and their opposing enamel cusps under various contact area sizes, which is unrelated to supporting cusps or occlusion. The fourth document examines the tensile resistance of complete cast crowns cemented on amalgam foundations retained by amalgapins, but does not mention supporting cusps or occlusion either. The fifth document discusses a self-adjusting stent for managing malignant tracheo-oesophageal fistulas, which is unrelated to dental structures like supporting cusps.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
