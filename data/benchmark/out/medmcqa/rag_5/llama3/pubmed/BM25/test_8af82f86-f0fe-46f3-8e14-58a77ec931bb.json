["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about a 4-year-old child with painless genu valgum. The relevant documents mention non-rachitic deformities of the knees in Nigerian children, which could be due to early weight bearing of immature bones or laxity of knee ligaments producing abnormal posture. This suggests that rickets may not be the cause of genu valgum in this child. The patient's age and presentation also make scurvy unlikely. Congenital anomaly is a possible but less likely diagnosis, as it would typically present at birth. Trauma to epiphysis is not relevant to this case, given the painless nature of the condition. Therefore, based on these factors, the most likely diagnosis is non-rachitic genu valgum.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A: Rickets\"\n}"]
