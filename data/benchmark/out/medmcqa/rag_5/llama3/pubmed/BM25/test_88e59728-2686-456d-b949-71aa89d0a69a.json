["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The provided documents describe the movement of the mandibular condyle. In 'Analysis of human mandibular movement', it is mentioned that lateral jaw motion appeared to be prominent during the masticatory phase and throughout the movement cycle. This suggests that lateral movement of the condyle is related to the lateral pterygoid muscle's function. Further, in 'Positional changes of the mandibular condyle assessed by three-dimensional computed tomography', it is mentioned that 3-D CT is most accurate in detecting inferior condylar movements, but lateral and posterior movements were assessed with less accuracy than the inferior positional changes. This implies that the lateral movement of the condyle may not be as accurately detected using this method, but it can still occur. Based on these findings, it is likely that lateral movement of the condyle is caused by the contraction of the pterygoid muscles.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
