["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the excision of the submandibular gland for calculus or tumours, which implies that the surgical approach will be through an incision below the angle of the jaw. This area is closely related to the mandible and hyoid bone. The relevant document [Examination technique in ultrasound calculus detection in the submandibular gland] mentions that as the mandible and hyoid bone present a shadow there is a margin for possible error, but this technique enables these areas to be seen and thus checked: a submandibular calculus may be seen as a third shadow between the other two. This suggests that the angle of the jaw is relevant in this procedure. Therefore, it is likely that the nerve to avoid during excision of the submandibular gland for calculus or tumours is the Mandibular branch of facial nerve.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
