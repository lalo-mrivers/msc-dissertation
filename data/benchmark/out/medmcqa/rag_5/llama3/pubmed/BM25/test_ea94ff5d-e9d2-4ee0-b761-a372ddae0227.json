["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the documents provided, we can identify that increasing the interocclusal distance beyond physiologic limits may lead to issues with condylar path recordings. The study [The effect of the interocclusal space on temporomandibular recordings] suggests that increased interocclusal space only slightly decreases the reproducibility of recording the condylar path, but this is still relevant for our consideration. Additionally, we can infer from [The effect of the interocclusal space on temporomandibular recordings] that both occlusally fixated and paraocclusally fixated trays may lead to erroneous recordings in certain clinical situations. Considering these findings, it is reasonable to assume that increasing the interocclusal distance beyond physiologic limits may result in issues with the mandible or maxilla.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
