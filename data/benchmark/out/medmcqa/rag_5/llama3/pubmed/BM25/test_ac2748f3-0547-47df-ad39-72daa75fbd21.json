["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the disadvantage of using a dry heat oven for sterilization compared to autoclave. The relevant document that discusses dry heat sterilization is [Sterilization in the daily dental practice]. According to this document, it takes 60 minutes to sterilize instruments with dry heat at 176Â°F. This suggests that dry heat sterilization might be time-consuming. However, we also need to consider another document [Effect of three sterilization techniques on finger pluggers] which mentions that after sterilization, the experimental and control finger pluggers were subjected to cyclic bending until fracture and all but one sterilized group had fatigue lifetimes statistically equal to or greater than nonsterilized controls. This implies that dry heat sterilization might not be less effective compared to autoclave.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
