["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking which sensation is NOT perceived by the spinal nucleus of trigeminal nerve. The relevant documents provide information about the function and organization of the spinal nucleus of trigeminal nerve. According to the first document, electro-acupuncture can depress the response of the spinal trigeminal nucleus evoked by electric stimulation of dental pulp. This suggests that the spinal trigeminal nucleus is involved in processing sensory information from the face, including touch and pain. The second document describes the development and organization of the main sensory nucleus of the trigeminal nerve, which is continuous with the spinal trigeminal nucleus posteriorly. This further supports the idea that the spinal nucleus of trigeminal nerve is involved in processing sensory information from the face.\n\nThe third document discusses the distribution of peptide pathways possibly related to pain and analgesia, including enkephalin and substance P. While this does not directly address the question at hand, it provides further evidence for the involvement of the spinal trigeminal nucleus in processing sensory information related to pain.\n\nThe fourth document examines the influences of central gray matter stimulation on thalamic neuron responses to high- and low-threshold stimulation of trigeminal nerve structures. This suggests that the spinal nucleus of trigeminal nerve is involved in processing sensory information from the face, including touch and pain.\n\nFinally, the fifth document describes the central and peripheral ends of substance P-containing sensory neurones in the rat trigeminal system. This provides further evidence for the involvement of the spinal nucleus of trigeminal nerve in processing sensory information related to touch and pain.\n\nGiven this information, it is clear that the spinal nucleus of trigeminal nerve is involved in processing sensations of touch, pain, and possibly temperature (although this is not explicitly stated). The only sensation not mentioned as being processed by the spinal nucleus of trigeminal nerve is proprioception. Therefore, the answer to the question is D: Proprioception.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
