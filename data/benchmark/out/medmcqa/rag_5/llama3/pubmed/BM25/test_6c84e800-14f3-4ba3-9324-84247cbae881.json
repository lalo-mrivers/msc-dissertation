["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents provided are about neuronal structures in the frog tectum opticum, a telescopic system for distance correction, loss of visual suppression of caloric nystagmus in cats, and an aberrant crossed visual corticotectal pathway in albino rats. None of these documents directly relate to the first order neuron of the visual pathway. However, they do discuss various types of neurons such as silent neurons, tectal neurons, and corticotectal axons. The key point is that there is no mention of photoreceptors, bipolar neurons, or the lateral geniculate body in these documents. Therefore, it can be inferred that the first order neuron of the visual pathway is not mentioned.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
