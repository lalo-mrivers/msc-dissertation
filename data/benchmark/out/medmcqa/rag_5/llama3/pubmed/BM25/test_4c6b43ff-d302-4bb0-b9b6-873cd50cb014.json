["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"After reviewing the provided documents, I analyzed the physiological methods of heat loss from the body mentioned in the texts. In the document 'Physiological reaction of men under exercise to radiant heat', it is stated that as there was a close correlation between the indices both at rest and during exercise, it was suggested that for the evaluation of heat tolerance, the radiant heat by the infrared illuminators is applicable as additional heat loading besides hot water bathing or staying in a hot chamber. This implies that physiological methods of heat loss are being discussed. In 'Ergonomics of heat and cold', the avenues of heat exchange between man and his immediate environment are presented, including radiation (r), convection (C), and evaporation (Eev). There is no mention of posture or peripheral vasoconstriction as physiological methods of heat loss. Sweating and vasodilation are mentioned in 'An instrument to monitor physiological and environmental parameters associated with heat stress on an ambulatory subject' as physiological parameters monitored.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
