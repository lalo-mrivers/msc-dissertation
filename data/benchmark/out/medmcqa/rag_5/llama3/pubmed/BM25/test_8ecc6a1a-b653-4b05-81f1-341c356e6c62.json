["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the changes that can be made to the insulin structure with the least change in its function. Upon reviewing the relevant documents, we see that there are no direct references to altering the structure of insulin. However, we do know that changes in adenosine and prostaglandins can affect insulin sensitivity. Therefore, our thinking will focus on what these changes might mean for the structure of insulin.\n\nFrom the [Alterations in insulin receptor in injured rats and the effects of dexamethasone and silybin] document, we see that insulin resistance following injury may be a consequence of receptor defect of the target cells. This suggests that altering the structure of insulin receptors could have an impact on insulin function. However, this is not directly related to changing the structure of insulin itself.\n\nFrom the [Recent developments in metabolism that impinge on research into the nature and treatment of diabetes mellitus] document, we see that changes in adenosine can affect insulin sensitivity. This suggests that changes in the regulatory mechanisms surrounding insulin rather than the structure of insulin itself might be the key to minimalizing changes in insulin function.\n\nTherefore, our thinking is leading us to consider options that are more related to changes in regulation rather than direct alterations to the insulin molecule.\",\n\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: Breaking disulphide linkages\"\n}"]
