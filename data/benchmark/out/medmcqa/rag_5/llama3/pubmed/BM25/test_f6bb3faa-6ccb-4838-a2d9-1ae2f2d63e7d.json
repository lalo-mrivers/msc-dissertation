["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks which type of oral candidiasis does not present with white patch. According to the relevant documents, Candida albicans biotypes were evaluated in patients with erythematous or pseudomembranous oral candidiasis. Pseudomembranous candidiasis is characterized by white patches or plaques. Therefore, it is possible that this type of oral candidiasis presents with white patch. On the other hand, chronic atrophic and chronic hyperplastic candidiasis are not mentioned in relation to white patches. Chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis is a type of oral candidiasis that can cause lesions on multiple sites including the mouth, but it does not necessarily present with white patches. Therefore, considering all the available information, pseudomembranous candidiasis is likely to be the one that presents with white patch.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
