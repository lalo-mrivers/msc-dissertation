["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about vasomotor reversal of Dale. Vasomotor reversal of Dale refers to the phenomenon where adrenaline (also known as epinephrine) causes blood vessels to constrict when the alpha-adrenergic receptors are blocked. This is in contrast to the normal effect of adrenaline, which is to cause blood vessels to dilate.\n\nFrom the provided documents, one can see that clonidine was used to investigate the effects on vasomotor loci in cats. It appears that clonidine inhibited the excitability of these loci, leading to hypotension and bradycardia.\n\nBased on this information, we can infer that adrenaline would cause blood vessels to constrict if the alpha-adrenergic receptors were blocked. Therefore, the correct answer is B: Propranolol followed by noradrenaline.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
