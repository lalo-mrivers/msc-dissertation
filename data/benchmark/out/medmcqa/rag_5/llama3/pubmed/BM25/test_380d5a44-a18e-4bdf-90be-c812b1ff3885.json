["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the potential damage caused by prolonged administration of streptomycin. According to the provided documents, we know that streptomycin can cause vestibular damage followed by renal damage in cats and dogs. We also know that streptomycin can affect the state of the tympanic muscles as a myorelaxant, leading to atrophic changes in the fibres of m. tensor tympani and some atony of m. stapedius. Additionally, we see that prolonged administration of streptomycin may lead to chronic atony of the tympanic muscles, which can result in loosening of the drum membrane tension, impairment of muscle activity coordination, and decreased ability for elimination of auditory ossicle fluctuation.\n\nConsidering these effects, it is likely that prolonged administration of streptomycin will cause damage to the auditory nerve. This is supported by the fact that gentamicin, another aminoglycoside antibiotic, is more toxic to the cochlea than streptomycin or dihydrostreptomycin in cats.\n\nTherefore, based on the provided information, it is most likely that prolonged administration of streptomycin will result in damage to the: C. Auditory nerve.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
