["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the given documents, we can see that vibration threshold determinations were expressed in terms of amplitude of stimulator movement measured by means of an accelerometer. This method was found to be statistically more accurate than using applied voltage. Similarly, in the creatine kinase isoenzyme study, it was concluded that determination of the perception threshold alone may be sufficient in most cases. Therefore, we can infer that a method that measures the amplitude or movement of a stimulator would be best for determining the threshold for diagnosis of a positive test.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C\n}"]
