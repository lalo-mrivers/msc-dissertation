["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To calculate the absolute risk reduction (ARR) and relative risk (RR), we need to first determine the number of patients who developed HT complications in each group. From the table, it is clear that 16 out of 15225 patients in the control group (old drug) developed HT complications, while 12 out of 15225 patients in the intervention group (new drug) developed HT complications. The ARR can be calculated by subtracting the percentage of patients who developed HT complications in the intervention group from those in the control group. This gives us an ARR of (16/15225 - 12/15225) * 100 = 0.0082 * 100 = 0.82%. The RR can then be calculated by dividing the proportion of patients who developed HT complications in the control group by that in the intervention group, which gives us a RR of (16/15225)/(12/15225) = 1.33.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
