["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"None of the provided documents directly address intraocular pressure in pregnancy. However, we can look for indirect clues by examining how various factors affect intraocular pressure. For example, there is a document that shows systemic blood pressure increasing with age and being positively correlated with intraocular pressure. This could imply that increased blood pressure, which occurs during pregnancy, might lead to higher intraocular pressure. Another document demonstrates the effect of osmotic agents on intraocular pressure. Water ingestion increases pressure, while glycerol decreases it. This suggests that changes in fluid balance can affect intraocular pressure. Pregnancy is characterized by significant hormonal and physiological changes. Therefore, we should expect some impact on intraocular pressure.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
