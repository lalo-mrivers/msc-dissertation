["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the phrenic nerve and its functions. Phrenic neuropathy is discussed in relation to various conditions such as cranio-cervical trauma, type 1 diabetic patients with diaphragm weakness, arsenic poisoning, cardiac surgery, and hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy. The studies highlight the importance of phrenic nerve conduction studies in evaluating ventilatory problems and respiratory function. In all these cases, the focus is on the phrenic nerve's role in diaphragmatic function. Therefore, it can be inferred that the phrenic nerve mainly supplies the diaphragm.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
