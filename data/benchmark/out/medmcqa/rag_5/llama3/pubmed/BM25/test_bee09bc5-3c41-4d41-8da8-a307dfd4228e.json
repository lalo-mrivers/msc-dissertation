["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, we can deduce that calcium carbonate is used as an abrasive in dentifrice. In the document 'Four variables affecting magnitude of dentrifice abrasiveness', it is mentioned that a hardness X concentration interaction showed that wear varied widely with concentration for the hard brush but scarcely at all for the soft brush. This suggests that the type of abrasive used in dentifrice can affect its abrasiveness. Additionally, in the document 'Reactivity of fluoride dentifrices with artificial caries. III. Quantitative aspects of acquired acid resistance (AAR): F uptake, retention, surface hardening and remineralization', it is mentioned that a dual-active NaF+MFP dentifrice in a calcium abrasive system exhibited decreased efficacy relative to a silica abrasive formulation due to incompatibility of free fluoride ion. This further supports the use of calcium carbonate as an abrasive in dentifrice.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
