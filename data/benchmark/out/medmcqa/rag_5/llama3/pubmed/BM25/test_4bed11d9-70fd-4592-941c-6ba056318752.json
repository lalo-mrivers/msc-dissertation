["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the effect of Mgo (Magnesium ion) on alginate powder. Since we are considering the properties of alginate power, we can rule out options A and B which seem unrelated to the properties of alginate. Options C and D both relate to the strength or durability of alginate, but option C is more specific to the shear and tear strength which is a measure of how well alginate holds together under stress. Therefore, based on the text it appears that adding Mgo to alginate powder would be expected to increase the shear and tear strength.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
