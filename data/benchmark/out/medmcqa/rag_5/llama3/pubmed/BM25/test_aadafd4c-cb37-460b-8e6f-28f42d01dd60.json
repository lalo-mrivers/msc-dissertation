["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question states that the patient has a large, dilated pupil. The Munchausen's disorder document mentions that a strong cholinergic solution will produce pupillary constriction in normals and neurologic disorders but often will not alter the pupil in cases of pharmacologic pupillary paralysis. This suggests that if topical administration of 1% Pilocarpine failed to produce pupillary constriction, it may be due to pharmacological blockade. Additionally, the Diagnosis of Pupillary Anomalies document states that lesions of the afferent, intercalated, efferent (parasympathetic), and cervical sympathetic arms of the pupillary pathway each tend to produce rather distinctive clinical signs. A large, dilated pupil is not typically seen in Adie's tonic pupil, diabetic III nerve palsy, or uncal herniation. Therefore, the most probable reason for topical administration of 1% Pilocarpine failing to produce pupillary constriction is pharmacological blockade.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
