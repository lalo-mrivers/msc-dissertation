["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the outcome when two screening tests are done in series. From the documents provided, we can see that one of the studies (Comparison between first and second generation tests to determine the frequency of anti-HCV antibodies in uremic patients in replacement dialytic therapy) compares the results of two different tests (1st and 2nd generation). The results show that the 2nd generation test is more sensitive than the 1st generation test, indicating that the sensitivity increases when using the second test. Therefore, we can conclude that the answer is C: Increased sensitivity and increased specificity.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
