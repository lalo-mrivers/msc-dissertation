["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about maintaining parallelism between the object and film to avoid distortion. In one of the documents, it's mentioned that when the focus to object distance is decreased while keeping the field size constant within the object, a limited increase in the mean energy imparted occurs. This statement is valid for the focus to object distances usually applied in diagnostic radiology. Since we want to maintain parallelism between the object and film, we should increase the target to object distance.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
