["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the articulation of the zygomatic bone. The provided documents describe various aspects of the zygomatic bone, including its fractures, attachment of muscles, and cysts. However, none of these documents specifically discuss the articulation of the zygomatic bone with other bones. Therefore, we must rely on general anatomical knowledge to answer this question. The zygomatic bone is part of the facial skeleton and articulates with several bones including the maxilla, sphenoid, temporal, and mandible.
