["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the loss of flexion in the interphalangeal joint of the thumb in a supracondylar fracture. The relevant documents mention congenital absence of the flexor pollicis longus, but this is not related to the current scenario. The other documents discuss dorsal fracture subluxation and extension block splintage, which is not directly applicable either.\n\nThe key to solving this problem lies in understanding the anatomy of the thumb. The flexor pollicis longus muscle plays a crucial role in flexion of the interphalangeal joint. A supracondylar fracture would likely involve damage to this nerve or the surrounding tissues, leading to loss of flexion.\n\nThe possible choices are nerves that supply the muscles involved in thumb movement. Among these, the median nerve is the most relevant because it supplies the thenar muscles, including the flexor pollicis longus muscle. This nerve is also responsible for providing sensation to the palmar surface of the hand and the radial 3.5 fingers.\n\nThe other choices are not directly related to the loss of flexion in the interphalangeal joint of the thumb.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
