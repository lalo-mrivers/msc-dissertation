["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks what properties myelinated nerve fibres have EXCEPT. We need to analyze the provided documents to find information about myelinated nerve fibres. From the document 'Myelinated Herring bodies in the median eminence of the cat', we can see that myelinated nerve fibres contain neurosecretory granules and a few mitochondria. From the document 'Observations on the morphology at the transition between the peripheral and the central nervous system in the cat', we can see that myelinated nerve fibres have nodes of Ranvier, where depolarization occurs only. The document also shows that there is no difference in diameter as it passes from PNS into CNS. From the document 'Differences in the axon composition of nerves supplying the rat knee joint following intra-articular injection of capsaicin', we can see that myelinated fibres were unaffected by capsaicin injection. Now, let's analyze the options: A talks about conduction speed, which is not mentioned in any of the documents; C talks about the outer layer being lipids, which is true according to 'Neurohistological observations on lung of female Perdicula asiatica (jungle bush quail) as revealed by cholinesterase technique' and also seen in 'Myelinated Herring bodies in the median eminence of the cat'; B talks about current discharges at nodes of Ranvier, which is supported by 'Observations on the morphology at the transition between the peripheral and the central nervous system in the cat'; D talks about depolarization occurring only at nodes of Ranvier, also supported by 'Observations on the morphology at the transition between the peripheral and the central nervous system in the cat'. Therefore, the correct answer is A.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
