["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the fate of IDL (Intermediate Density Lipoprotein) in plasma. We need to look for information related to IDL in the provided documents. Unfortunately, IDL is not explicitly mentioned in the documents. However, we can look for mentions of apoproteins and lipoproteins, which might give us clues about the fate of IDL. Apoproteins are known to govern metabolism of lipoproteins. In the first document, it is mentioned that Intralipid acquired an apoprotein complement similar to that found in chylomicrons following plasma incubation or in chylomicrons after alimentary lipemia. This suggests that Intralipid and chylomicrons undergo similar metabolic fates. There is no direct information about IDL, but we can infer that it might be metabolized similarly to chylomicrons.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
