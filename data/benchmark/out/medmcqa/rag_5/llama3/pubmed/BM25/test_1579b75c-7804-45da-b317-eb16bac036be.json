["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the strength of collagen. Collagen's strength is discussed in multiple documents. In the second document, it is mentioned that the great strength of the blood-gas barrier can be attributed to the extracellular matrix, especially the type IV collagen which is predominantly located in the very thin lamina densa. This suggests that the structure and arrangement of collagen fibers contribute to its strength. The fourth document discusses the tensile strength decrease of dermatosparactic collagen due to irregular aggregation of subfibrils to fibrils, suggesting that the arrangement of collagen fibers affects its strength. Additionally, the increase in fibril- and area-density resulting in an augmentation of crosslinks also contributes to increased strength. Therefore, it can be concluded that the strength of collagen is primarily due to its structural organization and arrangement.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
