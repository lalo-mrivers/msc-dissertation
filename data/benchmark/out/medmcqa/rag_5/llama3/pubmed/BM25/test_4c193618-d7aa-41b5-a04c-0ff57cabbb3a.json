["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The most relevant information is found in the 'Causes of perinatal death defined by autopsy at Ramathibodi Hospital' document. It states that more than half of the deaths in the late neonatal period (1,001-2,500 g) group were caused by infection. This suggests that infections may be a contributing factor to post-neonatal mortality. Additionally, the 'Neonatal sepsis in Turkey: the comparison between penicillin plus aminoglycoside and ampicillin plus third-generation cephalosporin chemotherapies' document highlights bacterial infections as a major cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality. This further supports the idea that infections may be a significant contributor to post-neonatal mortality.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
