["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the treatment of choice for an 8-year-old child who had fractured his maxillary central incisor 10 months ago. The pulp shows no response and there is no periapical lesion in the radiograph. This suggests that the tooth has undergone pulp necrosis due to the prolonged trauma, but since there is no periapical lesion, apicoectomy or root canal treatment might not be necessary. The options for pulpotomy (B) and ca(OH)2 pulp capping (A) are not suitable as they would not address the fractured tooth. Conventional root canal treatment (C) might also not be necessary given the absence of periapical lesion. Therefore, the most logical choice is D: Complete debridement and apexification.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
