["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for the diameter of the tip of a periodontal probe. We can look at each document to find the answer. The first document mentions different probe types and their characteristics, but it does not mention the specific diameter of the probe's tip. The second document talks about an automated periodontal probe, but it only mentions the diameter of the fiberoptic cutting tip, which is 100 microns (0.1 mm). This information is not relevant to the question. The third and fourth documents do not mention the diameter of the periodontal probe's tip either. Therefore, we can look at the last document that talks about stereotactic microsurgical resection of intracranial tumors using the electromagnetic field focusing system. According to this document, the EFF probe has a diameter of 0.3 mm at its tip.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"]
