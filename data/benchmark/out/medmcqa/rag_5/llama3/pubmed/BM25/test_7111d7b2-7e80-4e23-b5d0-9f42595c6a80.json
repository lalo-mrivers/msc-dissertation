["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the effect of 2,3-BPG on haemoglobin's affinity for oxygen. Based on the provided documents, it is known that 2,3-BPG binds to specific sites of haemoglobin and affects its affinity for oxygen. In Haemoglobin Rahere, a new high-affinity haemoglobin associated with decreased 2,3-diphosphoglycerate binding, the substitution affects one of the 2,3-diphosphoglycerate binding sites, resulting in an increased affinity for oxygen. On the other hand, Haemoglobin Malm√∂ has a high oxygen affinity due to the formation of a chemical bond between the -SH proton of the beta93 cysteine and the amide of oxygen of the substituted beta97 glutamine. This suggests that 2,3-BPG binding may decrease the affinity for oxygen.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
