["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the features of the color of normal amniotic fluid during delivery. We need to look for information that describes the typical appearance of amniotic fluid. The document 'Surface properties of the amniotic fluid in normal pregnancy' does not provide direct information on the color of amniotic fluid. However, the study 'Evaluation of phenazopyridine hydrochloride as a tool in the diagnosis of premature rupture of the membranes' mentions that the typical orange-to-red discoloration of the urine was seen in all study patients after oral administration of 400 mg of phenazopyridine hydrochloride 4 hours prior to amniocentesis, but this discoloration only became visible when the normal basic pH of amniotic fluid was acidified. Therefore, we can conclude that the color of normal amniotic fluid is not significantly affected by the presence of azo dye.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
