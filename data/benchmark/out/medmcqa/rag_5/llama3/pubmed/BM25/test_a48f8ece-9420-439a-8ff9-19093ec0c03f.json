["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about basic fear in a 2-year-old child during their first visit to the dentist. Considering the articles provided, 'Adolescent dental fear and control: prevalence and theoretical implications' discusses the etiology of severe clinical fear in children, which appears strongly related to direct conditioning in the presence of pain and vulnerability.
