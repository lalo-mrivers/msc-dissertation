["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents discuss various techniques for rebuilding deficient edentulous alveolar ridges with porous ceramic implants or using guided tissue regeneration. None of the provided documents specify minimum width requirements for ridge placement. However, one document (Prospective Review of Integral Implants) mentions that implants placed into thin ridges did not uniformly gain bone attachment levels during the healing period. This suggests that a minimum width is necessary to ensure proper implant placement and integration with surrounding tissue.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: 18 mm\"\n}"]
