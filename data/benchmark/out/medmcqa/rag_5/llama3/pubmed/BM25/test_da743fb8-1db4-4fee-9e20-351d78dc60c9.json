["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presented with edema, oliguria, and frothy urine. He has no past history of similar complaints. The laboratory tests show 3+ proteinuria, no RBCs/WBCs, and no casts in the urine. His serum albumin is low at 2.5 gm/L, while his serum creatinine is normal at 0.5 mg/dL. The combination of proteinuria, edema, and frothy urine suggests a glomerular disorder. The presence of high levels of proteinuria without significant hematuria or casts points towards a membranous or immunoglobulin-related disease. The patient's serum albumin is also low, which further supports the diagnosis of membranous nephropathy. \", \"answer_choice\": B}"]
