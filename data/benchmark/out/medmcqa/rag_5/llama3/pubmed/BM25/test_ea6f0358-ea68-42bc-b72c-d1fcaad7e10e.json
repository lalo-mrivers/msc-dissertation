["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to the study on the muscle response to the oral-screen activator, we can see that during rest with or without the appliance in place, there was no EMG activity in the buccinator and masseter muscles. This suggests that these muscles do not contract significantly under normal conditions. Additionally, the study on modulation of mechanically evoked perioral reflexes during active force mentions that the mentalis muscle is highly activated during spatula exercise, but this does not necessarily imply that it contracts significantly during other activities like swallowing or tongue thrusting. Hence, we can conclude that lip and mentalis muscle contraction are not seen in mature swallow, which aligns with option A.\", \"answer_choice\": A}"]
