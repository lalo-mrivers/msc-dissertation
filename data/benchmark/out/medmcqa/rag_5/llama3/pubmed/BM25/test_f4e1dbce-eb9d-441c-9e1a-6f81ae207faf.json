["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the soft tissue tooth interface that forms after flap surgery in a previously denuded area. The passage 'Healing following simulated fiber retention procedures in rats' provides information on the healing responses of a simulated fiber retention procedure.
