["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant document to answer this question is the one that discusses interosseous muscles. According to this document, the third and fourth fingers of the normal hands of 75 adult subjects were tested for active finger extension with the wrists in neutral position. The study found that 72 subjects could not actively extend the interphalangeal (IP) joints when the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joints were passively and maximally extended. This suggests that the IP joints are controlled by the interossei muscles. Among these fingers, it is mentioned that the dorsal branches of the digital artery supply the proximal phalangeal region with 2-3 branches in this area and 2 branches in the middle phalangeal region. The document does not specifically mention the number of dorsal interossei for each finger. However, based on general anatomy, it is known that the little finger has only one dorsal interosseous muscle, whereas the other fingers (ring, middle, and index) have two dorsal interossei.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
