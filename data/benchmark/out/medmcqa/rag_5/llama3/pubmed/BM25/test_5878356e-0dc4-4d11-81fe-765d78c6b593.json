["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the dimensionality of an arm taper. The relevant documents are about medical studies, swimming, dental restoration, and theoretical analysis of axons. None of these topics seem to be directly related to arm tapers. However, one study mentions the concept of taper in the context of crown retention and stress distribution. It seems that a taper refers to a gradual decrease or increase in a dimension. In this case, I'm assuming that 'arm taper' is referring to a 1-dimensional taper, where the size of the arm decreases gradually from one end to another. Therefore, I'll choose an option based on this assumption.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B: 2 dimension\""]
