["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the effects of excessive forces of occlusion within physiological limits. Based on the document 'Occlusal considerations in periodontal prosthetics', the objective is to minimize lateral forces on the teeth and direct forces along the long axis of the roots, which suggests that excessive forces within physiological limit would not result in an increase or decrease in the width of PDL. Instead, it would likely lead to trauma from occlusion.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
