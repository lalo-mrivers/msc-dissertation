["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking when pulpectomy and pulp capping are more successful in primary teeth. The relevant documents mention the considerations for direct pulp capping procedure in primary teeth, which includes selecting teeth with minimal or no clinical signs of pulpal inflammation, pretreating the carious tooth with a sedative restoration before excavating the caries, disinfecting the cavity floor, etc. The document also mentions that statistically direct pulp capping has been found to be less successful in primary teeth than indirect pulp therapy or coronal amputation (pulpotomy). However, it is acknowledged that vital primary pulp tissue is capable of healing without resorting to complete pulpectomy. This suggests that the success rate of pulpectomy and pulp capping may vary depending on the tooth selection criteria.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
