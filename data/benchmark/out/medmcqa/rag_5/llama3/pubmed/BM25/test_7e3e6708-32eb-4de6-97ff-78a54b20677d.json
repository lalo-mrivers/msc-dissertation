["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the type of secretion in salivary glands. We need to find relevant information from the provided documents. Document 1 talks about kallikrein secretion and its mediation through adrenergic alpha- and beta-receptors. Document 2 discusses epidermal growth factor (EGF) secretion, which is also mediated by adrenergic receptors. Document 3 talks about mucoprotein secretion in Drosophila melanogaster salivary gland cells. Document 4 describes protein synthesis and secretion in rat salivary glands. From these documents, we can conclude that the secretion of salivary glands involves both exocrine (secretion of saliva or other substances) and merocrine (release of preformed secretory product) mechanisms.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
