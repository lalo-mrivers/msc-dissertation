["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about endogenous staining of teeth during development. The provided documents describe various topics such as nerve growth factor, blood-brain relationship for saturated fatty acids, assessment of the preparation Carietest, and comparison of fluorophores. None of these topics are related to endogenous staining of teeth during development. Therefore, we need to consider the question in the context of oral health.
