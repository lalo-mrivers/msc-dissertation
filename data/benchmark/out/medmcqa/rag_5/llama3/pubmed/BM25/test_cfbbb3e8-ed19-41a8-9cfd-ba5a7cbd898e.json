["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the characteristics of high copper dental amalgams. According to the relevant documents, high copper dental amalgams exhibited significant properties such as slow compressive flow at low strain rates and no compressive flow at all loading rates. They also showed improved edge strength due to the absence of the corrosive-prone gamma 2-phase. The physical properties evaluated statistically included static creep, compressive strength, diametral tensile strength, and dimensional change. There is no mention of marginal breakdown, workability at lower Hg-alloy ratio, or resistance to tarnish and corrosion in these documents.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
