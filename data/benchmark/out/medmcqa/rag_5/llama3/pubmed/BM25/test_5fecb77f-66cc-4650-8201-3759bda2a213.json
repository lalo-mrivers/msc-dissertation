["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To calculate the steady state plasma concentration of drug X, we first need to find its clearance rate (CL) which is given as 640 mL/min. Next, we need to convert the infusion rate from mg/min to mg/hour by multiplying it with 60. This gives us an infusion rate of 96 mg/hour. We can then calculate the volume of distribution (Vd) using the formula: Vd = CL / k, where k is the elimination rate constant. Since we know the half-life, we can find k as: k = ln(2) / T1/2, which gives us a value of 0.386 hours-1. Plugging this into the equation, we get Vd = 640 mL/min / (0.386 hours-1) = approximately 1647 L. Finally, using the formula for steady state plasma concentration: Css = infusion rate / CL, we can calculate the steady state plasma concentration.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
