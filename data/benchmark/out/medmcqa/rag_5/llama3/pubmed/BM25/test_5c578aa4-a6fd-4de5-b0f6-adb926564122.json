["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about embalming without issuing a death certificate. I need to look for relevant sections that mention penalties for such an act. The documents provided are case reports and research papers on various medical topics, but none of them seem to be related to the specific issue of embalming or issuance of death certificates. Therefore, I will rely on general knowledge about Indian Penal Code (IPC) sections related to death and burial.\n\nSection 297 of IPC deals with causing a public nuisance by assembling in a manner causing obstruction, annoyance, etc. This section does not seem relevant to the question.\n\nSection 299 of IPC deals with giving false information as to identity of a deceased person. This could be indirectly related to issuance of a death certificate, but it is not directly applicable.\n\nOn the other hand, Section 201 of IPC deals with causing disappearance of evidence of offence, or giving false information to conceal offence. Embalming without issuing a death certificate could be seen as an attempt to cause disappearance of evidence or give false information to conceal the true identity of the deceased person.\n\nSection 498 of IPC deals with cruelty by husband or his relatives. This section is unrelated to the topic of embalming and issuance of death certificates.\n\nBased on this analysis, I believe that the correct answer is C: IPC 299.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
