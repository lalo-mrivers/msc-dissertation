["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about strong familial inheritance. We need to look for any relevant information from the provided documents that mentions genetics or family history. In the document 'Familial versus sporadic breast cancer', it is mentioned that a family history of breast cancer can increase a woman's risk by twofold to threefold, and patients with familial breast cancer have a younger age at diagnosis and have a higher frequency of bilateral disease compared to those with sporadic breast cancer. This suggests that there is a strong familial inheritance component in breast cancer. Similarly, the document 'The role of tumour suppressor genes in familial cancer' mentions that many forms of cancer show Mendelian inheritance, which implies that there is a strong genetic component involved. Based on this information, we can infer that breast cancer has a strong familial inheritance.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
