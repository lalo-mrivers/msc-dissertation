["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the relationship between the variance of Diastolic Blood Pressure (DBP) and Vitamin D, we first need to calculate the variance of DBP. The mean DBP is 110 mm Hg with a standard deviation (SD) of 11 mm Hg. The variance of DBP can be calculated as the square of the SD: 11^2 = 121.\n\nThe mean of Vitamin D is 18 ng/ml with an SD of 3 ng/ml. The variance of Vitamin D can be calculated in the same way: 3^2 = 9.\n\nComparing the two variances, we see that the variance of DBP (121) is significantly greater than the variance of Vitamin D (9). Therefore, option B: Variance of DBP > 4 times Vitamin D is correct.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
