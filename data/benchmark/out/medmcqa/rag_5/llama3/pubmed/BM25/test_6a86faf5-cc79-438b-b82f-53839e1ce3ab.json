["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The regulation and role of epidermal lipid synthesis document suggests that the primary function of the epidermis is to form a barrier between the organism and the outside world. The blood-aqueous barrier in the ophthalmic literature also discusses the concept of barriers in the context of blood-ocular barriers. However, none of these documents explicitly discuss the role of barrier membranes in GTR (Gross Tissue Repair). Therefore, it is necessary to look for a different document that might be relevant to this topic.\n\nUpon reviewing the document 'Role of cytoplasmic ATP in the restoration and maintenance of a membrane permeability barrier in transformed mammalian cells', I found that it discusses the role of cytoplasmic ATP in the restoration and maintenance of a membrane permeability barrier. Although this is not exactly related to GTR, it does mention the concept of a membrane permeability barrier, which might be relevant.\n\nBased on these findings, I conclude that the answer lies in the context of repairing the tissue damage caused by the disruption of the epidermal lipid synthesis or the blood-aqueous barrier. Therefore, the role of the barrier membrane in GTR is to help overall healing.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
