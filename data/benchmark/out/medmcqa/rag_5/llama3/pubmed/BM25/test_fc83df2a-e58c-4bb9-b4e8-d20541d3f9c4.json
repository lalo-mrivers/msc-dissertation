["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The problem is about determining the minimum sample size required to estimate the prevalence of disease in a population with a known proportion (50%). The investigator wants to be confident that the true prevalence lies within a certain range (45-55%) with 95% confidence. We can use the formula for calculating the sample size: n = (Z^2 * p * (1-p) / E^2), where Z is the Z-score corresponding to the desired confidence level, p is the known proportion, and E is the maximum allowed error.\n\nFirst, we need to find the Z-score corresponding to 95% confidence. The Z-score for a two-sided test with 95% confidence is approximately 1.96.\n\nNext, we substitute the given values into the formula: n = (1.96^2 * 0.5 * (1-0.5) / E^2). We can simplify this expression to get: n = (3.84 * 0.25 / E^2).\n\nSince we want the minimum sample size required, we need to find the value of E that corresponds to the desired maximum allowed error. Let's assume a small error of 1% (E=0.01). Substituting this value into the formula, we get: n = (3.84 * 0.25 / 0.0001) â‰ˆ 384.\n\nHowever, since the sample size must be an integer, we round up to the nearest whole number to ensure that our confidence interval is valid. Therefore, the minimum sample size required for the study is approximately 400.\",\n\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: 400\""]
