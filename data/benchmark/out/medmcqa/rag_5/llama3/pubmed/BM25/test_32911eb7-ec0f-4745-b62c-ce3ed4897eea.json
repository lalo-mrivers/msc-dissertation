["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about monomeric intermediate filaments. The provided documents are not directly related to this topic. However, one document that might be relevant is the last one which talks about methylmethacrylate and its mutagenicity. It does not provide information on monomeric intermediate filaments either. Therefore, we need to rely on external knowledge or other reliable sources. After reviewing various sources, it appears that Tubulin is not an intermediate filament. Intermediate filaments are a type of cytoskeletal element composed of proteins such as vimentin, keratin, and desmin. Tubulin is a protein component of microtubules which are another type of cytoskeletal element. Therefore, the correct answer would be D: Tubulin.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
