["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about what to do when complete denture teeth are in edge-to-edge contact in centric occlusion. The concept of an ideal occlusion is important here. An ideal occlusion should provide unhindered closure in centric relation, smooth-sliding lateral and protrusive movements, and an optimal bilateral vertical contact dimension. Based on the documents, it can be inferred that the teeth are not in a functional position because they are in edge-to-edge contact in centric occlusion, which suggests that there is a possibility of temporomandibular joint pain-dysfunction syndrome symptoms to develop in the future. Therefore, some adjustment is needed to bring the mandible into a more physiological border position.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
