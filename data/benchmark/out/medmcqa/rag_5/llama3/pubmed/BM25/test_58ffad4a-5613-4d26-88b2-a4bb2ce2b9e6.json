["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, we can see that withdrawal symptoms are a common phenomenon associated with the discontinuation of various drugs. In the context of antidepressive drugs, the report mentions general somatic distress, anxiety, agitation, sleep disturbances, movement disorders, cardiac arrhythmias, delirium and manic reactions as possible withdrawal symptoms. This suggests that abrupt cessation of antidepressants is not recommended to avoid severe withdrawal symptoms.\n\nIn contrast, the document on Acamprosate does not mention any withdrawal symptoms or difficulties with stopping its use. Therefore, it can be inferred that Acamprosate may not cause significant withdrawal symptoms when discontinued.\n\nThe other options (Fluoxetine, Fluvoxamine, and Seraline) are antidepressants known to have potential withdrawal symptoms. Therefore, they cannot be stopped abruptly without any withdrawal symptoms.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the available information, it appears that Acamprosate may not cause significant withdrawal symptoms when discontinued, making option A a possible answer.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
