["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the documents provided, it is clear that xeroradiography is a technique used for diagnostic radiology. It involves electrostatically charged plates sensitive to X-rays. We can infer from this description that xeroradiography is less sensitive to radiation exposure as compared to conventional film. This is further supported by the fact that xeroradiography has been shown to produce images with lower radiation exposure than conventional film, especially when using higher kV lateral oblique jaw and lateral and anteroposterior skull xeroradiographs.\n\nLooking at the provided options, it seems that option B: Hematopoietic tissue is most sensitive to radiation exposure. The document on Childhood leukaemia following the Chernobyl accident mentions increased risk of leukaemia in children exposed to radiation, which suggests that hematopoietic tissue is highly sensitive to radiation.\n\nThe other options, bone, nerve and muscle do not provide direct information about their sensitivity to radiation exposure. However, it can be inferred from the document on Radiation necrosis of the brain that bone may be less sensitive to radiation exposure as compared to other tissues.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
