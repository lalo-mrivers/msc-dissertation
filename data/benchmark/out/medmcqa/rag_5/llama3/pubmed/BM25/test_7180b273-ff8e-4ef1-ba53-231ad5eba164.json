["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 19-year-old with a swelling over the left angle of the mandible, temperature of 38°C, and negative history of trauma. The first thing that comes to mind is that the symptoms are similar to those described in 'Desmoplastic fibroma of the mandible: case report' where a 2-year-old girl presented with swelling in the region of the mandibular angle which had been wrongly diagnosed several times. The age and rapid development of the tumour, along with accompanying pain, suggested a sarcoma. Given that there is no history of trauma and the patient's age, it seems unlikely to be a spontaneous fracture or pericoronal infection. Mumps can cause swelling in the face, but it does not typically present with a temperature of 38°C without other systemic symptoms. Sjogren's syndrome may also cause facial swelling, but it is an autoimmune disorder that typically affects the exocrine glands and would be unlikely to present with fever and a solitary mass.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
