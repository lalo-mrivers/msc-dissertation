We need to look for a relevant document that discusses vitamin C synthesis or its mutants. The provided documents are related to vitamin E and C, but one of them mentions ODS rats, which are unable to synthesize vitamin C. This document is 'Synergistic action of vitamin E and vitamin C in vivo using a new mutant of Wistar-strain rats, ODS, unable to synthesize vitamin C.' According to this document, the ODS rats cannot synthesize vitamin C due to an enzyme deficiency. The relevant enzyme mentioned in the text is L-Gulonolactone oxidase.\", \"answer_choice\": C}"]
