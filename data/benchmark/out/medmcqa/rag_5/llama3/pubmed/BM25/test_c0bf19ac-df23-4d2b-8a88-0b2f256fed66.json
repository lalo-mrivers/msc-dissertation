["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The histology of granulation tissue is shown below. We are looking at the collagen production at early stages of wound healing, using histology and two immunohistochemical procedures on cross sections of rat skin harvested 0, 3, 5, 7 and 12 days after full-thickness incisions. The study found that intracellular collagenase was not reliably detectable at day 0, but was prominent at days 3 and 5 and thereafter declined. Double labeling technique showed occasional macrophages producing collagenase in the developing granulation tissue, but most cells labeled as macrophages were negative for collagen. Most activity was found in fibroblasts adjacent to granulation tissue elements. Since the granulation tissue parallels revascularization in a dendritic pattern, a cross section at three days typically shows an annulus of collagenase-positive cells surrounding a branch of the active granulation tissue.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
