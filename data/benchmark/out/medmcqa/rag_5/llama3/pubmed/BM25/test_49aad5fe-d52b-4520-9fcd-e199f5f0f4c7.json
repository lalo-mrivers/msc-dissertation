["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"None of the provided documents discuss the long-term effects of using a vibrator on human tissues. The first document discusses the physical constraints of bone-conduction speech audiometry and the maximum output level attainable with a Radioear B-70-A vibrator. The second document examines the maturation of human fetal responses to vibroacoustic stimulation. The third document describes a hypopharyngeal prosthesis for laryngectomees that uses air flow to stimulate pharyngeal or upper esophageal tissue vibration. The fourth document is unrelated to the use of vibrators on human tissues and discusses causal orientation and personal adjustment in hospitalized veterans. The fifth document investigates response characteristics of the Pr√§citronic KH70 bone vibrator, including masked threshold reproducibility, occlusion effect, and acoustic radiation.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
