["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the curve of occlusion touching the buccal and lingual surfaces of mandibular buccal cuspal teeth. The provided documents are related to dental anatomy and oral pathology. Upon reviewing the documents, I found that none of them specifically mention the curve of occlusion touching the buccal and lingual surfaces of mandibular buccal cuspal teeth. However, I did find a document discussing photoocclusion analysis for the reduction of occlusal table dimension of the pontics. This document divided the occlusal surfaces of molars into four regions buccolingually, which includes the buccal inclines and lingual inclines of the buccal and lingual cusps of the molars. The relationship of sigma epsilon value among these four regions is 3:5:2:0 respectively. This information does not directly relate to the curve of occlusion touching the buccal and lingual surfaces of mandibular buccal cuspal teeth.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
