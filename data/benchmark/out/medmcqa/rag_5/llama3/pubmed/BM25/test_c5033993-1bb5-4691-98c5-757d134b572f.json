["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the salivary gland output in Sjogren's syndrome. The patient selection criteria for electrostimulation of salivary production in the treatment of xerostomia secondary to Sjogren's syndrome indicate that patients with residual salivary tissue in the oral and pharyngeal regions who demonstrate a decrease in the flow rate of saliva are potential candidates for this procedure. This suggests that the salivary gland output is decreased in Sjogren's syndrome. Option C: Decreased output of salivary glands <0.5 ml/min is not explicitly mentioned, but it can be inferred from the context.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
