["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about porosity of methyl methacrylate resin. One of the relevant documents mentions that porosity was compared between denture resin cured by microwave energy and traditional heat method. Another document talks about porosity of resin filling materials, which shows that the use of a syringe reduced porosity content mainly by eliminating big pores. This suggests that porosity can occur due to improper processing or handling of the resin. Therefore, it is likely that porosity would occur if the flask was placed too soon during processing.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
