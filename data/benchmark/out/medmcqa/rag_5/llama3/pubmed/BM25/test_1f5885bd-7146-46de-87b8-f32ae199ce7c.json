["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents provide information on HDL's structure and function. According to the High density lipoprotein document, HDL is a discoidal particle comprising phospholipid, cholesteryl esters, and several apolipoproteins, which serves in transporting cholesterol from the periphery to the liver by the process of 'reverse cholesterol transport'. There is no direct information on where HDL is synthesised. However, we know that HDL promotes the efflux of cholesterol from cells in vitro, and may thus play an important role in the transport of cholesterol from non-hepatic tissues to the liver for excretion. This suggests that HDL synthesis might occur in non-hepatic tissues.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: None of the above\"\n}"]
