["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the properties of light cure composite. The first relevant document discusses the performance of a curing light and polymerization of composite restorative materials. It mentions that light energy absorption by the composite has been examined for its effect on polymerization contraction, and that the distance between the light source and composite sample affects light energy absorption. However, it does not mention any specific distance from tooth. The second document discusses the clinical evaluation of Clearfil photoposterior, a resin composite/bonding restorative system. It mentions that the enamel margins were etched for 60 seconds with 37% phosphoric acid gel, and that a resin composite was placed in three increments with a 20 second light cure of each increment. The third document discusses the polymerization shrinkage of light cure composite resin, but it does not mention any specific distance or time duration. The fourth document discusses computer-controlled differential scanning calorimetry of dental composites, which examines the heat liberated and temperature rise associated with the light cure. It does not mention any specific distance or time duration either.\n\nThe only option that is relevant to the question is D: Adding increments of 1-2 mm. This is because the documents discuss polymerization contraction and its relationship to light intensity, distance between the light source and composite sample, and sample thickness. The other options (A, B, C) are not supported by any information in the provided documents.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
