["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about a driver wearing a seat belt who suddenly applies the brakes to avoid a collision. The literature suggests that seat belts offer remarkable protection for car occupants involved in frontal-impact collisions but can cause injuries in side impacts, particularly chest and pelvic injuries. Since this scenario involves sudden braking to avoid a collision, it's likely to be a side impact or at least a forceful deceleration. Therefore, the body part most likely to be injured is the one that is vulnerable to seat belt-related injuries in such situations.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
