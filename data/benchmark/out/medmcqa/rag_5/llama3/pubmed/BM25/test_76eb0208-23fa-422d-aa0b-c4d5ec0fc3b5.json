["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the lingual cusp of maxillary 2nd premolar's contact point in the intercuspal position. The first relevant document describes the independent movement of cusps during occlusal loading, which does not seem directly related to this question. However, it mentions 'cuspal independence', where the loaded cusp does not demonstrate significant strain when the adjacent cusp is loaded. This implies that each cusp has its own specific contact point. The second document discusses the effects of different occlusal splint contacts on masticatory system, which does not provide direct information about the lingual cusp's contact point. The third document talks about variations in bone mass within the cortices of the mandible, which is also not relevant to this question. The fourth document describes the 'cusp writer' findings and their application to practical and theoretical occlusal problems. This document seems more relevant, as it discusses cusp angulation and its correlation with various occlusal determinants. Specifically, it mentions that steepening or flattening the lingual contour of the upper canine can change the incisal guide angulation, which could affect the lingual cusp's contact point. Finally, the last document describes a hypoglossal reflex elicited by mechanical stimulation of the mandibular mucosa in cats, which does not seem directly related to this question. Based on these documents, we can infer that each cusp has its own specific contact point, and the lingual cusp's contact point is likely related to the angularation of the upper canine.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
