["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the nerve fibers stimulated during pulp stimulation. According to the Role of intradental A- and C-type nerve fibres in dental pain mechanisms document, low-intensity electrical stimulation induces non-painful sensations while high-intensity stimulation evokes pain. The same document states that dentinal stimulation of teeth with healthy pulps induces sharp pain, which is mediated by A-fibres. Additionally, the Activation of sympathetic fibres in the pulp by electrical stimulation of rat incisor teeth document suggests that alpha-adrenoceptor mediated blood-flow responses occur upon monopolar electrical stimulation of teeth.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
