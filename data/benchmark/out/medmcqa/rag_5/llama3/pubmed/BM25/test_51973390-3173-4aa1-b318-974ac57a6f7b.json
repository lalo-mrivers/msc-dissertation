["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about a suitable technique used for diagnosis of posterior interproximal caries in children. None of the provided documents specifically mention posterior interproximal caries or its diagnosis. However, we can look at the techniques mentioned in the documents for diagnosing dental caries in general. The documents do not mention bite wing with Bisecting angle technique, Bite wing with Paralleling technique, or RVG as specific techniques used. Panoramic Radiography is not explicitly mentioned either. Therefore, we need to think of a technique commonly used for diagnosing interproximal caries. In the absence of any information about posterior interproximal caries specifically, we can consider the most common method of diagnosing dental caries in general. The documents mention mirror and probe as a technique used to examine children's teeth. This could be a suitable technique used for diagnosis of posterior interproximal caries in children.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
