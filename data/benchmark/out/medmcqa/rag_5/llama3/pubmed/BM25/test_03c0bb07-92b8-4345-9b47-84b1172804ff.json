["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has a contusion on the anterior chest wall with decreased breath sounds on the left side and trachea deted towards right. This suggests possible lung damage or compression. The heart sounds are normal which implies that there is no immediate cardiac issue. Therefore, the priority is to manage the respiratory compromise first. Needle thoracostomy or pericardiocentesis do not seem relevant in this scenario.

Immediate exploratory thoracotomy might be too drastic at this point.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
