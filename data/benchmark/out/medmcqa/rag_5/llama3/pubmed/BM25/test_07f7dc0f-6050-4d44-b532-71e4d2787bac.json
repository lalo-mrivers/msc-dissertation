["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the muscles that will tend to pull the mandible back following bilateral mandibular fracture in the canine region. From the given documents, we know that the muscles that control the position of the hyoid bone are the anterior belly of digastric, geniohyoid, and mylohyoid muscles. These muscles pull the hyoid bone cephalad and anteriorly. We also know from the same document that the stylohyoid muscles pull this bone cephalad and posteriorly, while the sternohyoid and omohyoid muscles pull it caudally. Since we are looking at mandibular fracture in the canine region, we can assume that these muscles will not be directly affected. However, we know from other documents that the masseter muscle is involved in jaw movement and is located in the canine region.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: Genioglossus and masseter\""]
