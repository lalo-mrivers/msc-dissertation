["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the best method to counteract acidosis during cardiopulmonary resuscitation. The relevant document is 'Effects on ionized calcium of a correction of acidosis with alkalinizing agents. A rational basis for the administration of calcium in cardiac resuscitation.' This document states that the ionized calcium concentration will be below control values when lactic acidosis is corrected, and this effect is even more pronounced when THAM (tris-hydroxymethyl)aminomethane is used. Therefore, it seems that administering alkalinizing agents like sodium bicarbonate or THAM may be a suitable way to counteract acidosis during cardiopulmonary resuscitation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
