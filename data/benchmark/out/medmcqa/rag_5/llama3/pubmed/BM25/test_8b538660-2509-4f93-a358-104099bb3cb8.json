["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to the study 'Laminar analysis of the origin of the various components of evoked potentials in slices of rat sensorimotor cortex', the wave N5 represents excitatory responses of neurons located at various depths in the cortex. Since we are looking for the same component in Brain Stem Evoked Response Audiometry (BERA), it is likely that N5 corresponds to V in BERA. Therefore, the activity represented by 'V' in BERA is likely to be the antidromic activation of cell bodies and possibly of proximal dendrites of neurons situated in layers III, IV and V.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C: Cochlear nerve\"\n}"]
