["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the provided documents, we can see that pure red cell aplasia is associated with lymphoma (Non-Hodgkins lymphoma presenting as pure red cell aplasia), immunosuppressive therapy (Remission of pure red cell aplasia associated with nonthymic malignancy), and possibly a primary immune dysfunction (Primary amyloidosis, pure red cell aplasia, and Kaposi's sarcoma in a single patient). This suggests that lymphoma is an acquired cause of pure red cell aplasia. Additionally, the document 'Acquired chronic pure red cell aplasia successfully treated with intravenous pulse methylprednisolone therapy' does not mention any other specific causes of pure red cell aplasia, only stating that it was associated with hypergammaglobulinemia and positive Coombs' test during the treatment of eosinophilic pneumonia with prednisolone. Therefore, we can conclude that lymphoma is an acquired cause of pure red cell aplasia.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
