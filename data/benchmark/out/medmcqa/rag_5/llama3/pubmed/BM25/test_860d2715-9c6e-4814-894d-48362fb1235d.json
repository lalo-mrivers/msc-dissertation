["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the association between repolarization and certain events in excitable cells. The relevant documents provide information on various aspects of electrophysiology, including cardiac conduction delays, ventricular pre-excitation, and repolarization anomalies. We can focus on the document that discusses synchronized repolarization after defibrillation shocks, as it provides insight into the relationship between repolarization and electrical activity. The study shows that defibrillation shocks cause an additional phase of depolarization followed by slow repolarization, which occurs regardless of the prior electrical activity. This suggests that repolarization is closely associated with a specific event, namely, the shock-induced activation of the myocardium.\", \"answer_choice\": C}"]
