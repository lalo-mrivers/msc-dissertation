["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks for the best biochemical description of glucose. The relevant documents provided are about glucose disappearance, normalization of plasma glucose, and the biochemistry of complement. None of these documents describe glucose as a ketose sugar, so option A is not correct. There is no mention of L form or D form in any of the provided documents, so options B and C can be eliminated. The minimal models of glucose disappearance suggest that glucose production and disposal are affected by insulin and glucose levels, but this does not describe the biochemical structure of glucose. Therefore, option D, which describes glucose as a disaccharide, is incorrect.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
