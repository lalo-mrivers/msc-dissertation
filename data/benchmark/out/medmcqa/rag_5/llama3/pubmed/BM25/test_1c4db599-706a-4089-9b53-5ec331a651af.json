["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about enzymes that play a role in calcification. The relevant documents mention the presence of certain elements like Cr, Fe, Cu, Zn, which may be involved in the mechanism of calcification. The document on 'Trace elements in tissues of normal and vitamin D2-treated rats' suggests that these trace elements may play an important role in calcification, some acting as challengers, others as adjuvants or inhibitors. Therefore, it is likely that enzymes related to these elements are involved in the process of calcification.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
