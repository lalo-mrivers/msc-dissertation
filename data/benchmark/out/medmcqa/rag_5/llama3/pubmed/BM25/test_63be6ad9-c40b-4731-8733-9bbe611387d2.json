["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks for the disadvantage of composite restoration that is not mentioned in the provided documents. We have to go through each document one by one to find out if the options are mentioned or not. The first document discusses the advantages and disadvantages of using composites in core restoration, but it does not mention the given options. The second document talks about post and core restorations, including those made with composite materials, but again, it does not mention the given options. The third document is about the gingival response to well-finished composite resin restorations, which also does not mention the given options. The fourth document presents a technique for fabricating fixed provisional restorations using light-curing acrylic resin, and the fifth document describes a clinical report on combined composite resin and amalgam restoration for posterior teeth. None of these documents mention the option 'D: More time in replacement'. Therefore, it can be concluded that this is not a disadvantage of composite restoration.\", \"answer_choice\": D}"]
