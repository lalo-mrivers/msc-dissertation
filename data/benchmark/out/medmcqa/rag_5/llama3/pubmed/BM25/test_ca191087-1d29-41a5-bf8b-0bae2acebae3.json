["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The provided documents describe various types of condylar fractures. In the document 'Different patterns of condylar fractures: an analysis of 382 patients in a 3-year period.', it is mentioned that medial override occurred both in children and adults, seeming to be the result of more severe trauma to the chin. This suggests that medial dislocation of fractured condyle can occur due to significant force applied to the chin. The document 'Condylar fractures of the mandible.' also mentions that medial angulation of the condylar fragment with lateral override at the fracture level was the typical fracture in adults. This further supports the idea that medial dislocation of fractured condyle is caused by significant trauma.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
