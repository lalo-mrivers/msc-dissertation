["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about a technique to move the tongue away from the post-pharyngeal wall. The documents provided describe various techniques for anesthesia, pharyngeal reconstruction, and cineradiography. However, none of these techniques directly address moving the tongue away from the post-pharyngeal wall.\n\nA related concept mentioned in one of the documents is 'tongue height' which was used to measure the distance from the external neck wall to the anterior pharyngeal wall (APW). This suggests that tongue position or movement might be relevant to the question. Another document describes a technique for pharyngeal reconstruction where the ventral surface of the tubed flap forms the cutaneous covering, which could potentially be related to moving the tongue away from the post-pharyngeal wall.\n\nHowever, none of these techniques directly address moving the tongue away from the post-pharyngeal wall. Therefore, we must look for a technique that is commonly used in clinical practice to achieve this goal.\n\nThe triple maneuver is a well-known technique used to move the tongue away from the post-pharyngeal wall during laryngoscopy or intubation. It involves three distinct steps: head extension, chin lift, and jaw thrust.\n\nTherefore, the most likely answer is B: Triple maneuver.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
