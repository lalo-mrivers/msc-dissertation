["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the transport systems between cementocytes and osteocytes. In the study on Differences in the transport systems between cementocytes and osteocytes in rats using microperoxidase as a tracer, it is mentioned that although extracellular tracer was deposited extensively along the plasma membrane of the deeply positioned cementocytes, uptake by these deep cementocytes was less than that of those close to the surface. In bone, most osteocytes showed uniform uptake. This suggests that resorption of cementum may occur less readily compared to bone.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
