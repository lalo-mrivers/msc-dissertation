["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents suggest that insulin resistance is seen in liver disease. In the document 'Mechanism of insulin resistance associated with liver cirrhosis', it is stated that liver cirrhosis impairs insulin sensitivity and maximum cellular glucose disposal, which suggests that the issue is not related to decreased secretion of insulin or low C-peptide level.
