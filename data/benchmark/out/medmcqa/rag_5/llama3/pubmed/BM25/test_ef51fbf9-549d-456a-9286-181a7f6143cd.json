["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the diffusion capacity of carbon monoxide. From the provided documents, we know that placental membrane diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide decreased at increased carbon monoxide tensions (document 1). Pulmonary diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide was also measured in miners and control subjects, with slight decreases observed in simple coal workers' pneumoconiosis (document 2). No information is provided about the diffusion capacity of carbon monoxide in polycythemia, interstitial lung disease, emphysema, or pulmonary vascular disease. Therefore, we can infer that the diffusion capacity of carbon monoxide is decreased in all except... Pulmonary vascular disease.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
