["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the localization of the receptor of hormone Xis. The provided documents mention Xis as a protein involved in lambda site-specific recombination, but there is no information about its receptor or hormone localization. However, one of the documents compares synthetic nuclear localization signal peptides from the steroid/thyroid hormone receptors superfamily. This suggests that the receptors for some hormones can be localized to the nucleus. Insulin resistance and sensitivity are discussed in another document, but there is no direct connection made between insulin and Xis. Glucocorticoid receptors are mentioned as being found in lung nuclei, which provides further evidence of nuclear localization of hormone receptors. Given this information, it seems unlikely that Xis would be a receptor for one of the commonly known hormones like adrenaline, thyroxine, or FSH.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
