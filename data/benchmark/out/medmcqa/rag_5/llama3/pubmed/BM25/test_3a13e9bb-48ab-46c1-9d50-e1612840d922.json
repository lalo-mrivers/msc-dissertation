["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient went into shock immediately after normal delivery. The relevant documents mention cases of shock due to intestinal haemorrhage from an ulcer, which was diagnosed after fibroscopy. Another case reports a rare occurrence of protracted anaphylactic shock after intravenous injection of methylglucamine iodipamide. However, these cases do not match the scenario described in this question. The patient went into shock immediately after normal delivery and had no underlying condition that would suggest any of these causes. Therefore, I need to consider other possibilities. The case report on management of thrombophlebitis during pregnancy mentions a patient who developed hypovolaemic shock due to intestinal haemorrhage from an ulcer. Although this is not the exact scenario described in the question, it suggests that intestinal haemorrhage could be a possible cause of shock. Finally, considering all the possibilities and excluding the more common causes such as amniotic fluid embolism, PPH, uterine inversion, and eclampsia, I conclude that the most likely cause of shock is an intestinal ulcer.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D\n}"]
