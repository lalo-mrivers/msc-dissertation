["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"There are no documents provided that directly address the question of ankylosis of mandibular molar after autotransplantation. However, one document discusses the etiology and prediction of mandibular third molar impaction, which is a different procedure. Another document discusses dental microdifferentiation, but does not provide any information on mandibular molar transplant or ankylosis. The remaining two documents discuss Hashimoto's thyroiditis and the relations of the mandibular canal with the outer surfaces of the body of the mandible, respectively. None of these documents provide relevant information to answer this question. Therefore, we must rely on our general knowledge of dental anatomy and possible complications after autotransplantation.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
