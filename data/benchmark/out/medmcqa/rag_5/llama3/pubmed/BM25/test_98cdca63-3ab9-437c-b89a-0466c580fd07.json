["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about a continuous murmur. We can identify the causes of continuous murmurs from the provided documents. Continuous murmurs are present in Lutembacher syndrome (accelerated blood flow passing through small atrial septal defect), pulmonary venous obstruction following Mustard operation for transposition of the great arteries, and patent ductus aeriosus.
