["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about master apical files. We have documents related to endodontics and periodontics, but none of them explicitly discuss master apical files. However, we can relate this to the document 'Master cone apical behavior under in vitro compaction' which talks about fitting gutta-percha points into an artificial canal. From this, we can infer that a master apical file is likely used for obturation or preparation of the root canal.\", \"answer_choice\": C}"]
