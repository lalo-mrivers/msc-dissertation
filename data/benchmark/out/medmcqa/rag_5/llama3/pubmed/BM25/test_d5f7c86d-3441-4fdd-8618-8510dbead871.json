["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the maximum number of genes that code for receptors in the mammalian genome. We can look at the provided documents to find relevant information. One document talks about complement receptors and cell-associated complement components, which mentions that many of these components are also present on cell surfaces. This suggests that the function of the complement system may be related to the major histocompatibility complex. Another document reviews how a family of genes coding for nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subtypes was uncovered. These findings do not directly address the question, but they provide context about the types of receptors found in the mammalian genome.\n\nThe other documents discuss mitochondrial genomes and the genetic code, as well as evolution of the mammalian G protein alpha subunit multigene family. While these topics are interesting, they do not provide direct information about the maximum number of genes that code for receptors in the mammalian genome.\n\nThe document 'Gene expression during preimplantation mouse development' discusses the construction of large and representative cDNA libraries from unfertilized eggs and early stage mouse embryos. This study identified several cytokines that are transcribed in the developing embryo, but it does not provide information about the maximum number of genes that code for receptors.\n\nConsidering these findings, we need to look at the provided options to see if any of them match the context of the question. The options include immunoglobulin receptors, interleukins, growth factors, and odorants. While the other documents mention various types of receptors, they do not specifically address the maximum number of genes that code for these receptors.\n\nBased on this analysis, we can conclude that option A: Immunoglobulin receptors is the most relevant choice.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
