["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents discuss sentinel lymph node biopsy in the context of penile cancer. The main point is that sentinel lymph node biopsy is used to stage the disease, particularly in patients with negative biopsies. It is recommended as a preliminary step before inguinofemoral dissection. Since this information is not directly applicable to other types of carcinomas such as cervix, endometrium, vulva, or vagina, we should look for general guidelines on sentinel lymph node biopsy. The document '[CT-guided biopsy of paraaortic lesions: report of three cases]' mentions that CT-guided biopsy provides a high quality specimen for histopathological diagnosis, which is also the goal of sentinel lymph node biopsy. However, this technique is not specific to penile cancer and can be applied to other diseases as well.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
