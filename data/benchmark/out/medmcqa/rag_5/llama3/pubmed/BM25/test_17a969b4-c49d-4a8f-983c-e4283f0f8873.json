["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the effects of acid etching on dentin. From the provided documents, it is clear that acid etching removes the smear layer (mentioned in The effects of acid etching on the pulpodentin complex), exposes collagen (not explicitly mentioned but implied as a result of removing the smear layer), opens dentinal tubules (mentioned in The retentive ability of acid-etched dentin), and increases surface tension (not explicitly mentioned). Therefore, one option that is not true is that it does not increase surface tension.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
