["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Distraction osteogenesis is a technique that grows new bone by stretching existing bones. It has been studied in long bones, but the study on sheep's mandibles suggests that the healing process after mandibular distraction is similar to that of long bones. Therefore, we can infer that distraction osteogenesis may affect pediatric patients' growth rate or rhythm. However, consolidation time and fixation time are not directly related to distraction osteogenesis. Hence, options A or B seem more likely.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
