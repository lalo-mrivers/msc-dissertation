["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents discuss the characteristics of lens proteins in normal and cataractous lenses. The formation of sugar-cataracts has been hypothesized to involve nonenzymatic glycosylation, sulfhydryl oxidation, and aggregation of lens proteins. High molecular weight aggregates have been found in both galactosemic and diabetic cataracts. A major high molecular weight disulfide-linked protein has been isolated from cataractous lenses but not from normal lenses of comparable age. This suggests that the presence of high molecular weight proteins is associated with cataractogenesis, specifically in humans.\", \"answer_choice\": C}"]
