["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about a screening test used in two similar populations. Since the proportion of false positive results among those who test positive is lower in population A compared to population B, this suggests that the specificity of the test is higher in population A. This is because the specificity of a test refers to its ability to correctly identify true negatives (i.e., people without the disease). If the specificity is higher in population A, it means that the test is more accurate in identifying true negatives, which would result in fewer false positive results.\", \"answer_choice\": D}"]
