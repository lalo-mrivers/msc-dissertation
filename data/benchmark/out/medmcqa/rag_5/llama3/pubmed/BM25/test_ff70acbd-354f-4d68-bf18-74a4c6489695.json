["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The first step is to calculate the partial pressure of CO2 (pCO2) from the given value. Since pCO2 = 30 mm Hg, this can be directly used. Next, we need to calculate the bicarbonate concentration (HCO3-) which is already provided as 6 mEq/L. The formula to calculate the base deficit is: Base Deficit = (HCO3- - 24) * (1 - (pCO2/6)). Substituting the values, we get: Base Deficit = (6 - 24) * (1 - (30/6)) = ?\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
