["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to the provided documents, the first document states that acarbose effectively reduces postprandial hyperglycaemia and haemoglobin A1c. This suggests that measuring blood glucose levels over time could be a way to assess long-term glucose control. The second document mentions that studies evaluating control based on blood and urine glucose assessments are complicated by the failure of the data to reflect changes in minute-to-minute regulation, implying that frequent or continuous measurements would be more accurate. Therefore, I conclude that long-term assessment of glucose control can be made by estimating postprandial blood sugar levels.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
