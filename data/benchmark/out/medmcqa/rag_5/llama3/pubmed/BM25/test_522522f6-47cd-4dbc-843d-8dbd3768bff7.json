["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the duration of action of proparacaine. None of the provided documents mention proparacaine, so we cannot find a direct answer. However, we can analyze the information and identify patterns. For example, morphine's duration of antinociceptive action is 6 times that of alpha-l-acetylmethadol (LAM), which has an onset of activity considerably later than morphine or methadone. Similarly, CDRI-85/287 had a duration of antiestrogenic and antiimplantation action of 3-4 days in rats. The pharmacokinetics and metabolism of benzodiazepines show that the duration of drug action is dependent on the kinetics of distribution and elimination of the parent drug and its effective metabolites. Buprenorphine had a very long duration of action, while sulfentanil's later doses showed an extended effect due to cumulation.\n\nConsidering these patterns, we can infer that proparacaine's duration of action might be relatively short or variable depending on individual factors. No specific information is provided to determine the exact duration of proparacaine's action.\", \n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
