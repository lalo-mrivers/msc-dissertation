["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks for the most likely cause when a patient has normal blood glucose level as estimated by glucose-oxidase peroxidase method, but shows positive Benedicts test in urine. The Benedicts test is used to detect the presence of reducing sugars, including glucose, fructose and galactose. Since the patient's blood glucose level is normal, it suggests that there might be another type of sugar present in the urine. Fructosemia could be a possibility as the Benedicts test can also react with fructose, but this would not be consistent with a normal blood glucose level.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: False positive\""]
