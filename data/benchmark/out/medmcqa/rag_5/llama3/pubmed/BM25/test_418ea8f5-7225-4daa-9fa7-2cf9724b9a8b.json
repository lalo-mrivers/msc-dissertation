["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the most common reason for sticking of food in interproximal area with a Disto-oclusal amalgam restoration. From the given documents, we can see that marginal failure of amalgam class II restoration was analyzed and it was found that when stresses were known, creep in the margin of the restoration was calculated. This suggests that the restoration's margin may be a potential cause for sticking of food.\n\nMoreover, the effects of cement bases on the stresses in amalgam restorations suggest that even small changes in the restoration's contact area can have significant effects on the stresses induced in the restoration.\n\nThe study about primary teeth shows that dentists recommend amalgam restoration most often for interproximal surfaces, which suggests that the sticking of food may be related to an inadequate or poorly fitting restoration. A longitudinal study of joint complaints does not seem directly relevant to this question.\n\nBased on these observations, it seems likely that the most common reason for sticking of food in interproximal area with a Disto-oclusal amalgam restoration is due to a problem with the contact area, such as a broad contact area buccolingually (choice A).\",\n\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
