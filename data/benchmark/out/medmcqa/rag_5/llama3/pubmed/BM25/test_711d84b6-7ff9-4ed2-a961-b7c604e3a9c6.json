["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The provided documents are related to the pharmacological effects of monomethoxyamphetamines, the role of 5'-deoxy-5'-methylthioadenosine in growth of microbial B12 requirers, and the metabolism of 5'-methylthioadenosine. However, none of these documents mention the setting time of pro-root MTA or its addition to decrease the setting time.\n\nThe only relevant information is that 5'-methylthioadenosine (MTA) figures in cellular methionine and polyamine syntheses, and it replaces B12 for growth of certain microbial organisms. This information does not provide a clear answer to the question.\n\nTherefore, I will rely on general knowledge or external sources to find an answer. According to dental materials science, adding calcium chloride (CaCl2) can help reduce the setting time of MTA (mineral trioxide aggregate), which is commonly used in endodontics.\n\nBased on this information, my answer would be C: 5% CaCl.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
