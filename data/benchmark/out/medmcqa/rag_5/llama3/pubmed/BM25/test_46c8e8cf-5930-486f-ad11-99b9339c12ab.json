["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the given documents, it is known that collagen tissues have different types of fibers. Reticular fibers are distinguished from collagen fibers by their staining characteristics with ammoniacal silver stain. They have a globular form and are associated with the interfibrillar matrix. In dermal collagen, the unit fibrils are stained rather than the interfibrillar matrix. Therefore, to determine where reticular fibers of collagen tissues are present or absent, we need to look for information on their presence in different tissues.\n\nUpon reviewing the documents, it is found that there is no specific mention of reticular fibers being present or absent in any of the given options (thymus, spleen, bone marrow, lymph node). However, based on general knowledge and understanding of collagen tissue composition, we can deduce that reticular fibers are likely to be present in connective tissues. This suggests that they may not be present in highly specialized tissues like thymus, spleen, or lymph nodes.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D: Lymph node.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
