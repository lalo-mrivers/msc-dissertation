["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about DNA repair on a damaged cell membrane. The relevant documents discuss various methods for detecting DNA repair enzymes and the process of DNA excision repair. Since the damage was caused by micro needle inseion, it's likely that the damage involves double-stranded breaks in the DNA. Based on this information, we can infer that the repair process will involve an enzyme-catalyzed process, as mentioned in the relevant document discussing Schizosaccharomyces pombe repair of UV-damaged DNA.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
