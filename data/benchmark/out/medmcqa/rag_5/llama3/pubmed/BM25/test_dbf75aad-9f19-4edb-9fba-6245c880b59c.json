["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking which of the options show chemical bond with enamel. The relevant document is [Dentin adhesives. An update]. According to this document, acid-etching does not enhance the bond strength of composite resins to dentin, and mechanical bonding to enamel using the acid-etch technique has been successful. This suggests that the focus is on bonding to enamel rather than dentin. Additionally, the other documents provide information on bonding to dentin or ceramic brackets with chemical retention, which are not relevant to this question. Therefore, the answer should be related to enamel.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
