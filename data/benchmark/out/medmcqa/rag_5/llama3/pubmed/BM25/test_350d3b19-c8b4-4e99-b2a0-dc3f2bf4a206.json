["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about Transient tachypnea of new born (TTN) which is not mentioned in the provided documents. However, one of the papers talks about transient changes in blood pressure and heart rate while talking about feelings of hopelessness and helplessness. This does not seem to be related to TTN. Another paper discusses sudden extreme drops in blood pressure in both experimental and clinical situations when a person is talking about or describing situations of hopelessness and helplessness. This also does not seem to be relevant to the question. The other papers discuss topics such as autologous bone marrow transplantation, maturity of personality, family communication, and tissue vitamin content. None of these seem directly related to TTN. Therefore, it seems that none of the provided documents have any information about the causes or situations where TTN is commonly seen.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
