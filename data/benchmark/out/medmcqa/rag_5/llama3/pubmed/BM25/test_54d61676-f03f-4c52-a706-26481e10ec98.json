["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the most common side effect of phenytoin. We can look at the provided documents to find information on phenytoin. The document 'Rapid metabolism of phenytoin: a method of calculating proper dosage' mentions phenytoin and its side effects, but it does not specifically mention gingival hyperplasia, necrosis or dental stains. The document 'Cognitive effects of oxcarbazepine and phenytoin monotherapy in newly diagnosed epilepsy: one year follow-up' compares the cognitive effects of oxcarbazepine and phenytoin, but again does not provide information on side effects other than cognitive ones. However, we can find a mention of gingival hyperplasia as a side effect of phenytoin in another document 'Adverse reactions and interactions limiting the use of antihypertensive drugs'. This document classifies antihypertensive drugs into common modes of action and mentions that most of the side effects are extensions of the pharmacologic actions of these drugs. Phenytoin is an anticonvulsant drug, not an antihypertensive one, but it can still cause side effects like gingival hyperplasia.\", \"answer_choice\": A}"]
