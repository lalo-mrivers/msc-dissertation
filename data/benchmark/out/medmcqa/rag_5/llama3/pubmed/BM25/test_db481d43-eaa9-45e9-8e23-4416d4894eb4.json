["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has undergone transsphenoidal hypophysectomy for pituitary tumour. Now he has low ACTH, TSH, FSH, LH. Considering the documents provided, it can be inferred that the patient's adrenal function is compromised due to the removal of ACTH-secreting cells. Therefore, glucocorticoids are likely to be given to the patient to compensate for the lack of natural cortisol production.\n\nThe other options do not seem to be directly related to the patient's condition: mineralocoicoids (aldosterone) are produced by the adrenal cortex and are unlikely to be affected by the removal of ACTH-secreting cells; levothyroxine is a synthetic form of T4, which is produced by the thyroid gland and is not directly related to the patient's pituitary condition; estradiol is an estrogen hormone produced by the ovaries and is also not directly related to the patient's pituitary condition.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be A: Glucocoicoids.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
