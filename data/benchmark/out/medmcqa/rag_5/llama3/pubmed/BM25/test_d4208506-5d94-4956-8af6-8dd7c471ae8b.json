["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"After reviewing the relevant documents, I found that the management of dengue shock syndrome is discussed in the document titled 'Management of dengue shock syndrome. A prospective study.' According to this document, patients with Grade III disease were given 30 ml/kg bw Lactated-Ringer solution at a free rate, followed by 20 ml/kg bw of synthetic plasma expander (Expafusin) in a rate of thrice the body weight and continued with lactated-ringer and 5% dextrose in 1/2 Saline alternately with a rate of twice the body weight per minute for the remaining first 24 hours. For Grade IV disease, the same fluids were given, except for the amount and infusion rate. The study concludes that close observation, critical assessment, and accurate rapid action are important factors. There is no mention of steroids, platelet transfusion, or antiviral therapy as part of the management of dengue shock syndrome.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
