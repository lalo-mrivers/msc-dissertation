["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has azoospermia on semen analysis, which could be due to testicular failure or vas deferens obstruction. HSG was normal, ruling out epididymal blockage. We need to differentiate between these two possibilities.\\r\\nFrom the given documents, we can see that unilateral vas deferens obstruction is a possibility (document 2). Additionally, document 1 presents a case of 45,X/46,XY mosaicism with bilateral gonadal dysgenesis, which could also lead to azoospermia. Therefore, we need to investigate further.\\r\\nOne possible diagnostic test is vasography or deferentovesiculography (document 2), which can help identify unilateral obstruction of the vas deferens.\\r\\nHowever, this test may not be applicable in all cases, and a more general approach would be needed.\\r\\nThe documents suggest that karyotyping could also be useful in identifying chromosomal anomalies like mosaicisms.\\r\\nBased on these considerations, I think the best diagnostic test to differentiate between testicular failure and vas deferens obstruction is Karyotyping (B).\\r\\n\", \"answer_choice\": B}"]
