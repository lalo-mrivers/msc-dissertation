["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks which fungus exists as yeast at 37째C and hyphae at 25째C. We can find the answer by looking for a fungus that is dimorphic, meaning it has two forms: yeast and hypha. The article 'Chitin synthesis in Candida albicans: comparison of yeast and hyphal forms' provides information about the chitin synthetase activity in both yeast and hyphal forms of Candida albicans. This suggests that Candida albicans is a dimorphic fungus that exists as yeast at 37째C and hyphae at 25째C.\", \"answer_choice\": C}"]
