["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, specifically 'Prevalence and distribution of dental caries in a late medieval population in Finland', it is observed that in the permanent dentition, carious lesions were most frequently observed at the cementum-enamel junction, particularly on the approximal surfaces. This suggests that caries can occur on the proximal surfaces of molars. Moreover, in the primary teeth as mentioned in 'Caries prevalence in primary teeth as a predictor of early fissure caries in permanent first molars', caries is more common on the proximal surfaces. Therefore, it is likely that on a primary 2nd molar, caries occur most commonly on the proximal surface.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
