["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents discuss various topics such as radiographic examinations in pediatric dentistry, fracture-dislocations of the sacrum, axial skeletal changes in paraplegics, pharyngolaryngeal fibroscopy under general anesthesia in children, and cerebrospinal fluid lysozyme activity in patients with central nervous system tumours. Radiographs are mentioned as being useful in some situations, such as detecting carious lesions and development of eruption problems in pediatric dentistry, and helping to determine the extent of forward dislocation in fracture-dislocations of the sacrum. However, there is no mention of radiographs being helpful in diagnosing cementoma, subluxation teeth, acute alveolar abscess, or impacted canines. Therefore, it appears that radiographs are not useful for any of these specific conditions.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
