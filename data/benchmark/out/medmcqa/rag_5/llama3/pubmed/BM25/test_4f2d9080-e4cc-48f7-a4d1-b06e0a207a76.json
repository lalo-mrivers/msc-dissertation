["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the best investigation to prove a rheumatic etiology in a girl with symptoms of involuntary movements. Sydenham's chorea and acute rheumatic fever are suspected, but no evidence of sore throat or other major criteria for rheumatic fever were present. Given that there is no evidence of sore throat, we can rule out options C (thrust culture) and D (PCR for M protein). Antistreptolysin O is often elevated in acute rheumatic fever, so option B seems like a good choice. However, the text also mentions that Sydenham's chorea is considered one of the major manifestations of rheumatic fever, which suggests that the best investigation would be to look for evidence of a previous group A Beta-hemolytic streptococcus infection, such as anti-nucleus caudatus and anti-subthalamic antibodies. Therefore, option B seems like the most logical choice.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
