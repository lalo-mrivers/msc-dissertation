["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with fever, jaundice, yellow-colored urine, and clay-colored stools, which are features of acute liver disease. The patient's history of smoking cessation within a few days of developing symptoms is suggestive of fulminant hepatitis. Given the high levels of serum enzymes (SGOT and SGPT) and bilirubin, it is likely that the patient has an underlying liver disease. Therefore, I would focus on ruling out acute viral hepatitis as the cause of his symptoms.\n\nThe investigations that I would send for are those that can detect IgM antibodies against the various viruses that can cause acute hepatitis. This includes HBV, HCV, HEV, and HDV.\n\nFrom the documents provided, case [A] presents with fever and jaundice, which is similar to the patient's symptoms. The autopsy findings of diffuse caseous necrosis in the liver suggest that the patient may have had underlying liver disease. However, this does not provide information on the etiology of the patient's symptoms.\n\nCase [B] discusses the use of transdermal clonidine for smoking cessation and its effectiveness in reducing withdrawal symptoms. This is not relevant to the patient's symptoms or investigation.\n\nCase [C] presents a case of primary male posterior urethral cancer, which is not related to the patient's symptoms or investigation.\n\nCase [D] discusses the use of alpha interferon in treating hairy cell leukemia. This is also not relevant to the patient's symptoms or investigation.\n\nBased on the information provided, I would focus on ruling out acute viral hepatitis as the cause of the patient's symptoms and send the following investigations: HBsAg, IgM antiHBC, AntiHCV, and AntiHEV.\"}, \n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
