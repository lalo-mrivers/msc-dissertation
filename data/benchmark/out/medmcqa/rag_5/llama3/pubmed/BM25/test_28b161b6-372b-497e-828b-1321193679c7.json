["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The provided documents discuss various aspects of fixed partial dentures, including stress concentrations and distribution. The relevant information is from the 'Fixed cantilever splints on teeth with normal and reduced periodontal support' document, which states that for a cantilever fixed partial denture with either normal periodontal support or a distal abutment with moderate degree of mobility and bone loss, occlusal forces are significantly distributed to only the three teeth closest to the loaded cantilever. This indicates that forces should not be directed as far as possible at right angles to the long axis of the teeth (Option A), but rather parallel to the long axis of the teeth (Option B).\", \"answer_choice\": B}"]
