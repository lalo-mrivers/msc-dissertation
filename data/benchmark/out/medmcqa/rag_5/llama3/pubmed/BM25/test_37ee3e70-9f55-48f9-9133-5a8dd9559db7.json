["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the genetic defect in alpha thalassemia. According to 'Decreased alpha globine mRNA in nucleated red cell precursors in alpha thalassemia', there is a decrease in alpha chain synthesis, which suggests that there is no excess of alpha chains. This decrease is confirmed by hybridization studies of mRNA from bone marrow cells and reticulocytes. Therefore, the correct answer is not B: No alpha chain, as alpha globin genes are still present but their transcription is decreased. Similarly, C: Excess beta chain is also incorrect, as there is no evidence to suggest that there is an imbalance in favor of beta chains.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
