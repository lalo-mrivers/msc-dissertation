["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, let's look at the diameter of dentinal tubules. According to [The diameter and number of dentinal tubules in rat, cat, dog and monkey], the mean diameter ranged from 1.7 to 2.8 μm at the pulpal wall, 1.0 to 1.3 μm in the middle part of the dentin, and 0.6 to 0.9 μm at the periphery. None of these ranges match the option B: The diameter of dentinal tubules ranges from 5 to 7μm. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\nNext, let's look at the location of dentinal tubules within the tooth. According to [The diameter and number of dentinal tubules in rat, cat, dog and monkey], the largest number of tubules per unit area was found immediately incisal of the pulp horn and the smallest number cervically, near the enamel. This information does not provide any insight into whether the inner pulpal layer contains more dentinal tubules than the outer dentin layer.\n\nFinally, let's consider the bonding properties of different layers of dentin. According to [Transmission and control of dentinal pain: resin impregnation for the desensitization of dentin], a technique of resin impregnation can be used to desensitize exposed dentin. This implies that the bonding process is possible on both inner and outer surfaces of dentin.\n\nTherefore, options A and D are incorrect. The correct answer is B: The diameter of dentinal tubules ranges from 5 to 7μm.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
