["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the structure of the dentinal tubule and odontoblast process, which suggest that the apparent limited peripheral extent of the process may be an artefact due to incomplete penetration of fixatives. Additionally, one study found a significantly high correlation between the dentinal tubule morphology and dentin hypersensitivity. Another study examined the effect of dietary factors on intradentinal dye penetration in rats and found that the rate was dependent on dietary factors. In the context of sealer penetration into dentinal tubules, the document on cervical canal leakage after internal bleaching suggests that the extent of dentinal penetration is related to the presence of a base material over gutta-percha.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
