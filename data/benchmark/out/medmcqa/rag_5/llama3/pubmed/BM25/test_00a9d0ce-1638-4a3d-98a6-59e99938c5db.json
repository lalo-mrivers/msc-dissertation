["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking which drug acting on the dilator pupillae has an action similar to that of pilocarpine on the sphincter pupillae. Pilocarpine stimulates the sphincter pupillae and increases the discomfort threshold. We need to find a drug that does something similar for the dilator pupillae.\n\nFrom the documents, we can see that mydriasis caused by activation of the dilator muscle (phenylephrine-induced) initially had no effect on the discomfort threshold but as the pupil responses returned to normal the threshold rapidly increased and then gradually returned to a pre-drug level. This suggests that the dilator pupillae has some role in increasing the discomfort threshold.\n\nTherefore, we are looking for a drug that increases the activity of the dilator pupillae, which is analogous to pilocarpine's action on the sphincter pupillae.\n\nFrom the choices, phenylephrine (B) fits this description. It activates the dilator pupillae and increases the discomfort threshold.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
