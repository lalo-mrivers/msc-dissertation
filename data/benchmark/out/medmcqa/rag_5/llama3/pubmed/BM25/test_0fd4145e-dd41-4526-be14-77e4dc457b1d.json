["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about metallic taste, which is related to the Gustducin gene mentioned in the first document. The second document talks about transduction mechanisms for amino acids, but it doesn't mention metallic taste. The third and fourth documents discuss general taste transduction mechanisms, but they don't specifically address metallic taste either. Therefore, we need to focus on the fifth document which mentions latency of taste nerve signals in frog, and it seems unrelated to our question.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A: Stannous triphosphate\"\n}"]
