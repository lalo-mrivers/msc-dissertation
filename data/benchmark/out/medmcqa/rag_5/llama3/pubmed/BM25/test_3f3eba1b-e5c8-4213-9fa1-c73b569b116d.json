["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about measuring arch perimeter. The provided documents are related to orthodontic expansion, automated perimetry, glaucoma, and neurologic diseases. There is no mention of cephalogram or occlusal radiograph in these documents. Brass wire and Vernier calipers are both measurement tools that could be used for physical measurements. However, the document about Increase in arch perimeter due to orthodontic expansion describes a mathematical model using spline interpolation to fit a smooth curve between assigned molar, canine, and incisor positions. This suggests that the arch perimeter is being measured mathematically rather than physically.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
