["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the given article 'Effect of insulin on ultrastructure and glycogenesis in primary cultures of adult rat hepatocytes', it is clear that both glycogenesis and glycogenolysis are related to the synthesis and breakdown of glycogen. The key enzymes involved in this process are glycogen synthase (which converts glucose into glycogen) and glycogen phosphorylase (which breaks down glycogen into glucose). Both processes involve these two enzymes, making them common between glycogenesis and glycogenolysis.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
