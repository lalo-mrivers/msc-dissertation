["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the amount of blood loss that leads to hypotension in hemorrhagic shock. According to the document 'Hemorrhagic shock with fixed hypotension and with spontaneous recovery of blood pressure', both groups (hypotensive and normotensive) have a continuous outflow of blood into the reservoir until the arterial pressure reaches 40 mm Hg, which is maintained for 1.5 hours. This suggests that hypotension occurs when blood loss is more than 31-32 ml/kg, which corresponds to approximately 15% - 30% of total blood volume.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
