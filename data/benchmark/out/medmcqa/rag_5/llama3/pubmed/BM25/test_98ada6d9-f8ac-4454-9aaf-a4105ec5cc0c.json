["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the biomechanics of a fracture mandible posterior to the site of fracture. According to the provided documents, there are no specific details about this type of fracture. However, we can consider general principles of fracture mechanics and look for relevant information in the provided texts. The document 'Mistakes and dangers in the treatment of facial fractures' does not provide any information about the mandible fracture biomechanics. The other documents discuss various types of fractures and their treatments, but none specifically address the biomechanics of a mandible fracture posterior to the site of fracture. Therefore, we need to rely on general principles of fracture mechanics and consider possible scenarios.\n\nBased on the given information, it is unlikely that the fracture is a 'teardrop' fracture as described in 'The axial load teardrop fracture. A biomechanical, clinical and roentgenographic analysis', as this type of fracture typically occurs in the vertebral body corner.\n\nIt is also unlikely that the fracture is an odontoid fracture or a facial fracture, as these types of fractures are discussed in separate documents.\n\nConsidering general principles of fracture mechanics, we can assume that the posterior loading on the mandible fracture would cause compression forces on the lower surface and tension forces on the upper border. However, without specific information about this type of fracture, it is difficult to determine which option best represents the biomechanics of the fracture.\n\nTherefore, I will choose an answer based on general principles of fracture mechanics and possible scenarios.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A: Tension on upper border\"}"]
