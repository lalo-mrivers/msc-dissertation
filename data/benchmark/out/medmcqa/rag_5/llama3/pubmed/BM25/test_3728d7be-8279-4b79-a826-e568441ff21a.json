["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the Krebs cycle and its interaction with amino acids. Specifically, they discuss the role of transamination reaction in the Krebs cycle. The question asks which amino acid does not enter the Krebs cycle by forming Acetyl-CoA pyruvate. This process involves the conversion of alpha-ketoglutarate to glutamate through a phosphate-dependent glutaminase. Based on this information, we can conclude that glycine is the amino acid that does not enter the Krebs cycle by forming Acetyl-CoA pyruvate.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
