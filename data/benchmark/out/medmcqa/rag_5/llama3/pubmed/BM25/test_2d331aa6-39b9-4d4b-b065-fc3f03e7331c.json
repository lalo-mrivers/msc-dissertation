["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents provided describe the effects of local anesthetics (LAs) on nerve membranes. One document describes the preparation of coated-wire electrodes with LA cation-selective membranes and their properties in vitro. Another document studies the effects of subblocking concentrations of LAs on impulse generation and conduction in single myelinated sciatic nerve axons in frog. A third document examines hormonal regulation of motor unit size and synaptic strength during synapse elimination in the rat levator ani muscle. Finally, a fourth document investigates the effect of angiotensin II (AII) on peritoneal transport during peritoneal dialysis in rats.\n\nFrom these documents, it can be inferred that LAs act on nerve membranes by blocking the conductance of Na+ from exterior to interior.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
