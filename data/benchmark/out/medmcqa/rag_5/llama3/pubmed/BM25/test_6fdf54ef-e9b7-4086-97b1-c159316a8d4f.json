["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the activation of naive T cells. Based on the provided documents, naive CD4+ T cells respond vigorously to soluble antigen presented by dendritic cells (DCs). We also know that DCs are potent stimulators of proliferation and IL-2 secretion at low cell numbers. In addition, we see that naive CD4+ T cells do not respond well to resting B cells or macrophages, but they do respond to high numbers of activated B cells.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
