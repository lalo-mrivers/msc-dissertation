["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the treatment options used to decrease uterine contractility in preterm labor. From the provided documents, we can see that indomethacin and nylidrin are both mentioned as treatments for preterm labor, but they did not affect corticotrophin-releasing hormone (CRH) levels. This suggests that these medications may be used to decrease uterine contractility in preterm labor. On the other hand, magnesium sulphate is also mentioned as a treatment option, but it is not clear from the provided documents whether it is specifically used for decreasing uterine contractility. The other options, methyl alcohol and dexamethasone, are not relevant to the topic of preterm labor or uterine contractility. Therefore, we can conclude that all the above-mentioned treatments (except magnesium sulphate) may be used in preterm labor to decrease uterine contractility.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
