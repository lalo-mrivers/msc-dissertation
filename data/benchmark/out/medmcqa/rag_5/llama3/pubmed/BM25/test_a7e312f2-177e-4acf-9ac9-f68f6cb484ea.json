["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about antibody production in chronic allergy. The relevant documents mention IgG and IgE antibodies specific for soyabean proteins in calves fed heated soyabean flour (document 2). In humans, reaginic bronchial allergy is associated with IgE antibodies in serum to mites (Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus) (document 3).

Therefore, the antibody produced in chronic allergy is likely to be IgE.\", \"answer_choice\": D}"]
