["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents discuss radiation exposure and reduction methods. In [Radiation exposure of the hands and feet during x-ray studies in small animals], it is mentioned that lead gloves are no protection against primary rays. This suggests that primary radiation is a significant concern. [Dose reduction in xeromammography (author's transl)] discusses the use of total filters, including 3 mm of aluminium, to reduce radiation dose. This implies that aluminium filters can be effective in reducing radiation exposure. Considering these points, it appears that placing an aluminium filter in the primary beam is likely intended to reduce radiation exposure to the skin.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
