["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks for the X-ray angle(s) required to take for root fracture. After reviewing the relevant documents, I notice that [Computed tomography of cranio-facial injuries (author's transl)] mentions the use of X-ray survey and radiograms for diagnosis of frontobasal injuries. In [Experimental horizontal fractures of front tooth roots and their endodontic endosseous pin fixation in monkeys], it is mentioned that 45°, 90° and possibly 110° angles might be used to fix a root fracture with endodontal bone pins. However, there is no specific mention of these angles being necessary for diagnosis. Therefore, I will focus on the [Computed tomography of cranio-facial injuries (author's transl)] document which provides information about X-ray usage in diagnosis. According to this document, step 1 recommends a plain X-ray survey and eventually X-ray radiograms of the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses for diagnosis of frontobasal injuries.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: 45°,\t90°, 110°\""]
