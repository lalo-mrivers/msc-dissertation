["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the bonding agent's hydrophobic group. The relevant documents describe the properties of surfaces and adhesion. Hydrophobic surface proteins are mentioned as being involved in the adherence of group B streptococci to epithelial cells. Dental adhesive systems also contain monomers with hydrophilic and hydrophobic groups. Since hydrophobic surface proteins and groups are mentioned, it's likely that the bonding agent's hydrophobic group binds to a surface.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
