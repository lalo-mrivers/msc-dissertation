["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Reichert's membrane is mentioned in multiple documents. In the document 'The disappearance of the decidua capsularis and Reichert's membrane in the mouse', it is stated that Reichert's membrane is intact on the sixteenth day, but has ruptured on the seventeenth day. This suggests that Reichert's membrane is a structure that exists during early embryonic development. In the document 'Induced and genetic mouse middle ear ossicular malformations: a model for human malformative ossicular diseases and a tool for clarifying their normal ontogenesis', it is mentioned that the mouse 'far' (first arch malformation) mutation is responsible for minor ossicular abnormalities which disrupts the normal relationships between the stapes, Reichert's cartilage and stapedial muscle. This suggests that Reichert's cartilage is somehow related to the first arch or pharyngeal arch.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
