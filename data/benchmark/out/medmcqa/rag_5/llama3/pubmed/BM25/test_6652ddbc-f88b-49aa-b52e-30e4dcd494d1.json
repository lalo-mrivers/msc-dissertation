["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Since the provided documents do not mention any specific tooth as an enigma to endodontist, we need to look for any relevant information. The document 'Differential diagnosis of periapical radiolucent lesions' suggests that a clinician should have knowledge on various abnormalities and diseases that occur in the jaws. However, it does not specifically mention any particular tooth as an enigma. Similarly, other documents such as 'Keloids: enigma of the plastic surgeon', 'Tooth crown heights, tooth wear, sexual dimorphism and jaw growth in hominoids' and 'Time, place, event of sudden death' do not provide relevant information on this topic. On the other hand, the document 'Endodontists: a manpower projection' is not relevant to this question as it deals with endodontic programs and manpower projections. Therefore, based on the provided documents, we cannot identify any specific tooth that is known as an enigma to endodontist.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"None of the above\"\n}"]
