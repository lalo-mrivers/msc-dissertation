["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The provided documents describe the metabolic interactions between ethanol and drugs. Ritonavir is an antiretroviral drug that inhibits the metabolism of certain drugs. Since the question asks about ritonavir's effect on the metabolism of specific drugs, we can look for information on ritonavir's inhibition of drug metabolism in the provided documents. Unfortunately, there is no direct mention of ritonavir or its inhibition of drug metabolism in the provided documents. However, one document mentions that ethanol inhibits the metabolism of many drugs, but does not inhibit its own metabolism. This suggests that ritonavir may have a similar effect on drug metabolism. Based on this information, we can make an educated guess about which drugs' metabolism is inhibited by ritonavir.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
