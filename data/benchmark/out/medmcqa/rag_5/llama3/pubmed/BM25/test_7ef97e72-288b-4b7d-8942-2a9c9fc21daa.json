["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the given documents, fibrous histiocytoma has been reported to involve various sites such as orbit, thigh, trachea, bladder, parotid gland, and lung. Based on this information, it can be inferred that fibrous histiocytoma does not specifically involve the eyelid or epibular region. Therefore, options A and B can be eliminated. The documents also suggest a possibility of intraocular involvement as reported in one case of fibrous histiocytoma metastatic to the orbit. However, this is an exception rather than the rule, and intraocular involvement is not a common presentation of fibrous histiocytoma. Therefore, option C can also be eliminated. The most likely answer is therefore D: Orbit, as it is one of the reported sites of involvement and does not involve the other options.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
