["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents discuss the concept of hinge axis location on articulators. The passage 'Hinge-axis location and face-bow transfer for edentulous patients' mentions the importance of locating the hinge axis for edentulous patients by using a modified Loma Linda hinge-axis locator. This allows for accurate alteration of the vertical dimension of occlusion, obtaining valid centric and eccentric relation records, and articulating cusp-form posterior teeth with minimal occlusal correction. The passage does not explicitly state the need to transfer the hinge axis in orthodontics or changing vertical dimensions. Therefore, we can conclude that the compulsory transfer of the hinge opening axis is necessary for edentulous patients.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
