["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the structure of gastric glands and the location of chief cells. The document 'Cell differentiation in human gastric gland as revealed by nuclear binding of tritiated actinomycin' states that all degrees of labelling are observed at various levels with a decreasing proportion of labelling from the surface to the bottom of the gland, where parietal cells are concerned. This suggests that chief cells are located in the lower part of the gland. Additionally, the document '[Epithelial formula and relationship between the chief and parietal cells of fundal gastric glands in gastric and duodenal ulcer]' states that the hyperpepsinogenic cellular shift (a rise of the content of chief cells up to 50% and more) is observed in patients with duodenal ulcer, which implies that chief cells are present in the upper part of the gland.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
