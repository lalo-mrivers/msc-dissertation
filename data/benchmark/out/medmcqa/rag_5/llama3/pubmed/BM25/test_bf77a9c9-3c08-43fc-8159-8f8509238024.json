["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about genomic imprinting, which involves the modification of DNA based on its parent of origin. The provided documents describe the involvement of DNA methyltransferase (DNA MTase) in preimplantation mouse embryos and its role in genomic imprinting. We also know that a gene subject to genomic imprinting maps to chromosome 11q23-qter. Based on this information, we can infer that the modification of DNA involved in genomic imprinting is likely methylation.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B\n}"]
