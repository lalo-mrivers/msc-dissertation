["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks for features of benign intracranial hypertension (BIH) except the ones listed. From the provided documents, we can identify that BIH is characterized by raised intracranial pressure without any underlying structural lesion. This is seen in patients with primary empty sella syndrome, giant intracranial epidermoid tumours, and thoracolumbar intraspinal tumours.\n\nThe options given are proptosis, normal size ventricles, headache, and papilledema. Proptosis can occur due to raised intracranial pressure and is not exclusive to BIH. Headache is a common symptom in patients with BIH, but it's not unique to this condition. Papilledema, which is the presence of fluid in the optic disc, is a characteristic feature of BIH.\n\nThe only option that stands out as not being a feature of benign intracranial hypertension is normal size ventricles.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
