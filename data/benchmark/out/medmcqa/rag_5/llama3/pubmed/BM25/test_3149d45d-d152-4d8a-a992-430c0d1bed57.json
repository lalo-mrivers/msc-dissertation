["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents provided do not directly discuss the number of patients required in a clinical trial to treat a specific disease. However, one document, 'Computer simulation as a tool for clinical trial design', mentions that computer simulations can facilitate the estimation of the number of patients required in a clinical trial. This suggests that the size of the expected treatment effect may be a factor in determining the number of patients needed. Additionally, 'Efficiency in clinical trials of caries preventive agents and methods' discusses the importance of considering the objectives and limitations of an experimental clinical trial when planning it.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
