["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the first sensation to be lost following administration of local anesthetic. The study 'Pain sensation related to local anesthesia injected at varying temperatures' suggests that subjects experienced no difference in pain during injection of warm and cold anesthetic solution given respectively. This implies that pain is not immediately affected by local anesthetics. Similarly, in the study 'Local anesthesia of the knee for arthroscopic surgery', the technique used did not mention any specific loss of pain sensation. Therefore, it can be concluded that the first sensation to be lost following administration of local anesthetic is likely proprioception or touch.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
