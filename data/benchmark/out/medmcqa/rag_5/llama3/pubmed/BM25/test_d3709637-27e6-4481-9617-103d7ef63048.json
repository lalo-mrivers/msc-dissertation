["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The parent is homozygous for the autosomal recessive gene, meaning they have two copies of the recessive allele. The other parent is heterozygous, meaning they have one copy of the recessive allele and one copy of a normal allele. When these parents reproduce, each child has a 50% chance of inheriting the recessive allele from the homozygous parent and a 50% chance of inheriting the normal allele from the heterozygous parent. Therefore, half of the children will inherit two copies of the recessive allele (homozygous) and be affected by the condition.\", \"answer_choice\": C}"]
