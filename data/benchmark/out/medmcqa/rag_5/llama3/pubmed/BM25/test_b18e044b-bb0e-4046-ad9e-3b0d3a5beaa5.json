["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The passage about muscarinic acetylcholine receptors inhibits cell cycle progression of small cell lung carcinoma suggests that activation of mAChR causes exponentially growing SCLC cells to arrest in S and G2/M phases of the cell cycle, concomitant with a decrease in DNA synthesis. This is similar to the effect of cAMP on yeast cell cycle, which increases the critical cell size required for the G1-S transition. Therefore, the gene that inhibits cell cycle is not specific to any particular receptor or protein.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
