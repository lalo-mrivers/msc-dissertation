["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the consumption of a poison that produces bluish discoloration of the stomach during postmortem examination. The relevant documents provided are case histories and research papers on various topics such as hereditary acrolabial telangiectasia, putrefaction, brainstem lesion, endoscopy in lye burns, and biosynthesis of formic acid by the poison glands of formicine ants. None of these documents mention bluish discoloration of the stomach during postmortem examination. Therefore, we cannot find a direct answer to this question. However, the only document that mentions anything related to stomach is 'Endoscopy in lye burns of oesophagus and stomach'. According to this paper, upon ingestion of lye and its compounds, severe corrosive lesions may develop not only in the oesophagus but also of the stomach. Brown-black discoloration of the mucosa of the stomach signifies necrosis through the thickness of the wall which is an indication for immediate resection.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
