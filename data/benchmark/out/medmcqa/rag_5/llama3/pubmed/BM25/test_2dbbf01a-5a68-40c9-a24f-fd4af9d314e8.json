["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Since the question is asking about WHO definition for considering a high endemic area for meningococcal meningitis, I will look for relevant information in the provided documents. The document 'Heterogenity of serotypes of Neisseria meningitidis that cause endemic disease' does not provide the specific criteria for WHO definition of high endemic area for meningococcal meningitis. Therefore, I will rely on general knowledge and search for WHO guidelines or standards related to assessing the magnitude of the xerophthalmia problem, which are also discussed in the document 'Xerophthalmia in North Sumatra'. According to this document, WHO criteria assesses the magnitude of the xerophthalmia problem based on minimum point prevalence rates. However, I will not find specific criteria for considering a high endemic area for meningococcal meningitis within these documents. Therefore, my answer will be based on general knowledge and relevant standards.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
