["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the management of overdosage of Fibrinolytics. Since none of the provided documents discuss Fibrinolytics or its overdose, we have to rely on general knowledge and principles of medical management. Fibrinolytics are a type of antifibrinolytic agent that inhibits plasmin formation. In general, the management of their overdose would involve counteracting the increased fibrinolysis. Epsilon amino Caproic Acid is an antifibrinolytic agent and its use in managing overdosage of Fibrinolytics makes sense. Tranexamic acid is also an antifibrinolytic agent and could be used to manage Fibrinolytics overdose. DDAVP (Desmopressin) is a vasopressin analog that can increase fibrinolysis, so it's unlikely to be used in managing overdosage of Fibrinolytics. Fresh Frozen Plasma (FFP) contains clotting factors and could be used to correct coagulopathy caused by Fibrinolytics overdose.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
