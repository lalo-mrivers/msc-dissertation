["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about axonal transport. Axonal transport refers to the movement of organelles, proteins, or other substances along the length of an axon. In the provided documents, axonal transport is studied in various contexts. For example, in The relation of axonal transport of mitochondria with microtubules and other axoplasmic organelles, it is mentioned that axonal transport of mitochondria is dependent on microtubules. Similarly, in Ascending projections of the locus coeruleus in the rat. I. Axonal transport in central noradrenaline neurons, axonal transport of proteins and metabolites is studied. In Urate transport in the nephron, it is mentioned that urate transport occurs in the proximal tubules. Finally, in Axonal flow blockade induces alpha-CGRP mRNA expression in rat motoneurons, axonal flow is blocked to study its effects on protein synthesis. Based on these documents, it can be concluded that axonal transport refers to the movement of substances along the length of an axon.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
