["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the formocresol pulpotomy technique. The relevant documents describe various methods of pulpotomy, including zinc oxide-eugenol pulpotomy and stainless steel crown restoration, but they do not mention the specific technique of applying cotton to pulpal stumps. Therefore, we need to look for information on formocresol toxicity and its use in pulpotomy procedures. In the document 'Formocresol toxicity: is there a suitable alternative for pulpotomy of primary molars?', it is stated that more work is required before an alternative to formocresol can be recommended, but in the meantime, a 1:5 dilution of the standard formocresol solution should be used. This suggests that using undiluted formocresol may not be the best approach. The document 'A clinical evaluation of root resorption by formocresol treatment in 120 cases of pulpotomy in permanent molars' does not provide information on the technique, but it highlights the potential for root resorption as a complication of formocresol treatment.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
