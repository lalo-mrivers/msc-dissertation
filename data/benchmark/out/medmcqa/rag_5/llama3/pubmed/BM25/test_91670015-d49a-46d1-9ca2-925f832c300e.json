["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the square root of pq/n. The relevant documents mention 'Square' in different contexts: Square eye morphology induced by a P element in somatic tissue of Drosophila melanogaster, Square wave jerks in Friedreich's ataxia, and Codman Square Community Partnership for Health Promotion. However, none of these contexts seem related to the mathematical concept of square root. Therefore, it is unlikely that 'Square' in this question refers to one of those contexts.\", \"answer_choice\": B}"]
