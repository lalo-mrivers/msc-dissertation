["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to the document 'The histogenesis of lymph nodes in rat and rabbit', the development of the lymph node is characterized by the formation of a primitive cortex consisting of an area with evenly scattered lymphocytes among the basic network of reticular cells. This suggests that the cortex of the lymph node contains lymphocytes. In addition, according to the document 'The pattern of human lymph node involvement by the non-Hodgkin lymphomas of B-cell lineage', the lymph nodes studied showed involvement of the B-cell areas in all the lymph nodes, which is consistent with the presence of lymphocytes in the cortex.\", \"answer_choice\": D}"]
