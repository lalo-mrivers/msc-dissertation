["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the lead with maximum R wave voltage for an ECG with 'mean' axis of 90deg. The 'mean' axis indicates that the axis is almost horizontal, which means it's close to +30deg or -150deg (since 0deg is the normal axis). Since it's not exactly +30deg but close to it, we can consider the R wave in lead III as the maximum voltage, because in a 'mean' axis ECG, lead III often shows the largest R wave amplitude.\",\n\"answer_choice\": A\n}"]
