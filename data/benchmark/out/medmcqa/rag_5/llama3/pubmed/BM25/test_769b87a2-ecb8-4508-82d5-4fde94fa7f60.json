["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents suggest that fluoride from fluoridated water accumulates in the enamel of teeth. The article '[Fluoride concentration of drinking water and fluoride content of the enamel in deciduous teeth]' states that if optimal accounts of fluoride are available, the fluoride content in the enamel of deciduous teeth is twice as high as that in teeth of children from areas without fluoridation. This indicates that the fluoride content in the enamel of deciduous teeth is related to the fluoride concentration in the drinking water.\n\nGiven that the child spends 8 years in a temperate climate where the drinking water had fluoride of 3 ppm, we can infer that the fluoride content in the enamel of deciduous teeth will be higher than normal. The article '[Fluoride concentration of drinking water and fluoride content of the enamel in deciduous teeth]' suggests that the optimal fluoride content is twice as high as that in teeth of children from areas without fluoridation.\n\nThe article [Rate of dental caries in youths from communities of both naturally high and low, resp., fluoride content in drinking water (author's transl)] states that the DFS index was 5.3 for test persons aged from 6 to 15 years, in a community with a drinking water supply having a naturally increased fluoride content (Falkenberg/Oberpfalz, 1.8 ppm F').\n\nConsidering these points, we can conclude that the child's teeth will be affected by high fluoride concentration.\", \n\"answer_choice\": C"]
