["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the first paranasal sinus to develop at birth. The relevant documents are about CT scans of the paranasal sinuses, but none of them specifically mention which sinus develops first at birth. However, studying whole-mounted sections of the paranasal sinuses can provide insight into their relationships and anatomy. According to one study, the anterior ethmoidal complex was free of disease in 38.7% of the examined scans, suggesting that this area may not be the main source of chronic and/or recurrent sinusitis. This information does not directly answer the question, but it provides context about the paranasal sinuses' anatomy and relationships.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
