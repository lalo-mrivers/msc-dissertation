["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The key sentence is 'Enzymatic penetration through intact sulcular epithelium.' This suggests that enzymes can pass through the sulcular epithelium. The document also mentions that hyaluronidase has the ability to penetrate through intact nonkeratinized sulcular epithelium, widening the intercellular epithelial spaces and disorganizing the connective tissue ground substance. This means that substances, including bacterial products, can pass into the gingiva from the sulcus. The document also states that 'Hyaluronidase acts unquestionably as a spreading factor.' This implies that once an enzyme passes through the sulcular epithelium, it can spread easily and deeply into the connective tissue. Therefore, it is likely that bacterial products can pass into the gingiva.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
