["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the anatomy of the scalp, the region near the porus acusticus internus, and the accessory meningeal artery. The question is about the main arterial trunk supplying the infra-temporal fossa. We can start by looking at the superficial temporal artery, which is described in one of the documents. However, this document does not specifically mention the infra-temporal fossa. Therefore, we need to look at other possibilities. The maxillary artery is mentioned as a possible origin for the accessory meningeal artery, but it is not clear if this artery supplies the infra-temporal fossa. The deep temporal and posterior superior alveolar arteries are also mentioned, but they do not seem to be directly related to the infra-temporal fossa.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
