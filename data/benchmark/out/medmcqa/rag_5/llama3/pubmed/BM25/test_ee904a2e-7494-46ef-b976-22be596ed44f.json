["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the subantimicrobial dose of doxycycline. In one of the documents, it is mentioned that 16 mg doxycycline or rolitetracycline/kg resulted in a minor short-lasting increase of blood pressure and extension of the P-Q interval in the ECG. This suggests that even a high dose like 16 mg/kg can cause some cardiovascular effects. Therefore, we should look for documents that mention lower doses. In the study on single-dose doxycycline for cholera, it is mentioned that the recommended dose was 200 mg (4 mg/kg in children) and this was effective clinically. This suggests that a dose of around 4-5 mg/kg may be sufficient for clinical treatment. Therefore, we can assume that a subantimicrobial dose would be lower than this.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
