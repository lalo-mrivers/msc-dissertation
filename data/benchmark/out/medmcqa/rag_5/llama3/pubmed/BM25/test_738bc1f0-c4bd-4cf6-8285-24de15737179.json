["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"No relevant information is provided about the morphology or characteristics of upper 1st premolars and 2nd premolars that would allow for a direct comparison. However, we can look at the study 'Spontaneous changes in the rotation of premolar teeth from eruption until the established dentition' which mentions that both upper and lower second premolars which erupted rotated had a tendency to improve over time. This does not provide information about 1st premolars but suggests that 2nd premolars, including those in the upper arch, share some characteristics.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
