["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about myelopathy. None of the options A to D seem directly related to myelopathy. However, the terms 'sensory loss', 'brisk jaw jerk' and 'brisk pectoral jerk' are more relevant to neuropathy or neurophysiology rather than myelopathy.

Hence, it is likely that this option is correct.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
