["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents provide information about Merkel's cells and their structure. The first document discusses the changes in the ultrastructure of Merkel's nerve endings after denervation. It states that the nerve terminal of the Merkel cell has degenerated and was phagocytised by neighbouring keratinocytes, but the Merkel cells themselves did not change in structure. This suggests that Merkel cells are independent of their nerve terminals and do not rely on them for function. The second document is a review article about adnexal neoplasms, including Merkel cell carcinoma. It does not provide any information about the function of Merkel cells. The third document discusses suppressor T-cell function in thyrotoxicosis and has no relevance to Merkel's cells. The fourth document describes peculiar cytoplasmic structures in cytotrophoblast cells in pre-eclampsia, but does not mention Merkel cells at all. Therefore, the information provided suggests that Merkel cells are likely involved in tactile sensation.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
