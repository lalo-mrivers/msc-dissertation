["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the method used to check out the mean of values. In the [Use of the straightened diagram method in morphologic studies] document, it is mentioned that confidence intervals plotted on the diagram accurately enough serve as a criterion for the experimental dots proximity to the straight line. This suggests that statistical methods are being used to determine the mean and its variations. The mention of 'experimental values' and 'accumulated frequences' also points towards statistical analysis. Therefore, I believe the correct answer is not related to chi-square test or student's analysis, as these tests are typically used for hypothesis testing or comparing means between groups. Instead, the method used to check out the mean of values is likely a graphical representation of the data.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
