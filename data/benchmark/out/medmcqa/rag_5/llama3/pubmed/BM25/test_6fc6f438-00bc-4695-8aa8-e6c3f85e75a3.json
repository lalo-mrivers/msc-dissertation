["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the etiology of Periodontal disease. According to the documents, Periodontal disease is an inflammatory condition caused by a number of different diseases possibly associated with different etiologies rather than a single disease. Therefore, we need to identify which organisms are not implicated in the etiology of Periodontal disease. Cardiobacterium hominis endocarditis and Ménière's disease were discussed, but they do not seem related to Periodontal disease. The document 'Periodontal therapy in humans' discusses the microbiological and clinical effects of periodontal scaling and root planing, and of adjunctive tetracycline therapy. It highlights the role of host responses in periodontal disease. Hence, we can conclude that the organisms implicated in Periodontal disease are not specified in this document. The question does not ask about the organisms' role in the pathogenesis or treatment of Periodontal disease, but rather their involvement in its etiology. Therefore, we need to look for a clue outside these documents. This is where 'Responses of monkey nucleus of the optic tract neurons during pursuit and fixation' comes into play. Although this document does not directly discuss Periodontal disease, it provides information about various organisms, including Bacteroides, Wolinella, Neisseria, and Eikenella. According to this document, these organisms are present in humans. Therefore, if one of them were implicated in the etiology of Periodontal disease, it would be mentioned here. As there is no mention of these organisms being implicated in the etiology of Periodontal disease, we can conclude that none of these organisms are involved in the etiology of Periodontal disease.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: Eikenella\""]
