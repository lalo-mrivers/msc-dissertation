["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The case presents a 10-year-old boy with a contaminated wound over the left leg following a road traffic accident. The boy has received his complete primary immunization before preschool age and received a booster of DT at school entry age. Given that the wound is contaminated, it's crucial to consider the risk of tetanus infection. Since the patient has already received a booster of DT, the next step would be to administer TT (tetanus toxoid) injection to prevent the development of tetanus.
