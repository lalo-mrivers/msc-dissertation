["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks which cell type is most increased in number in the connective tissue wall of a periodontal pocket. The relevant documents provided are studies on wound healing, periodontal repair, and periodontal ligament fibroblasts. From these studies, it can be inferred that during periodontitis, there is an increase in inflammatory cells such as plasma cells, leukocytes, and lymphocytes. However, the study that most closely relates to the question is the 'Microscopic evaluation of clinical measurements of connective tissue attachment levels' study which discusses the histological changes that occur during periodontal disease. This study mentions that the degree of inflammation has a significant influence on the level of probe penetration. It can be concluded that during periodontitis, there is an increase in inflammatory cells such as plasma cells, leukocytes, and lymphocytes.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B: Leukocytes\""]
