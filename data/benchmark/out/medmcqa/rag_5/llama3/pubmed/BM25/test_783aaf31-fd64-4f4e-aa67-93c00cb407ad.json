["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for something that is not associated with haemorrhage. We need to look through the provided documents for relevant information about haemorrhage. One document mentions bleeding gastrointestinal angiodysplasia, and another reviews computed tomography features of ruptured arteriovenous malformations in the acute stage, mentioning intracerebral or intraventricular haemorrhage. We don't find any information related to melanosis or ecchymosis in these documents. Therefore, we need to look at the choices provided. Ecchymosis is a condition characterized by the appearance of purple spots on the skin due to bleeding under the skin. Petechiae are small red or purple spots that appear on the skin as a result of minute bleeds. Purpura is a condition where there is bleeding into the skin, resulting in discoloration. Melanosis is not related to haemorrhage. Therefore, we can conclude that melanosis is not associated with haemorrhage.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
