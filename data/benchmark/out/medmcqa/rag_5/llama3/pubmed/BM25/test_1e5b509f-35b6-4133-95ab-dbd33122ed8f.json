["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the likelihood of developing other primary malignancies in children with germline retinoblastoma. The relevant documents suggest that these patients are more likely to develop second nonocular malignancies, which occur almost exclusively in patients who have had bilateral retinoblastoma. Additionally, the document 'Incidence and management of secondary malignancies in patients with retinoblastoma and Ewing's sarcoma' states that childhood cancer survivors at highest risk of developing a secondary malignancy are those with hereditary retinoblastoma, with the majority of such secondary cancers being sarcomas, most commonly of bone.
