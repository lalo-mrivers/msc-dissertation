["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The devices described are a device for quantitative analysis of sum total pulse activity, a device that registers the movements of the lower jaws of cattle during food consumption and rumination, a traction device for use in radiology department, a measuring device for static and dynamic recordings of the tensile force in the halo-pelvic apparatus and in the halo-Milwaukee brace. The first two devices do not work on traction principle. The third one is a traction device but its purpose is to apply traction for control of the displaced cervical spine. The last one measures tension forces which involves traction. So, all these devices work on traction principle. Therefore, there are no exceptions.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
