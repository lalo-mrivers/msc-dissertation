["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about Binder in investment for dental castings. The relevant document is 'Binder distribution onto binary mixtures of glass spheres'. This study discusses the binding properties of different binders on glass spheres. It mentions that binder uptake was greater onto smaller spheres, and there were differences in uniformity of uptake depending on the type of binder used. There is no mention of silica or gypsum, so options C and D can be eliminated. The document does not provide information about expansion reduction, but it does discuss the binding properties and rigidity of the binders, making option B a possible answer.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
