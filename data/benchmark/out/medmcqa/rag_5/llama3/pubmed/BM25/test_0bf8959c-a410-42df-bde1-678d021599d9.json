["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"After reviewing the documents, we are looking for the anterior teeth with Mesiodistal size more than Cervicoincisal dimension. This information is not provided directly in the given documents. However, we can make an educated inference by comparing the sizes of different tooth types. The document on crown diameters of deciduous teeth in Australian Aboriginals states that the mandibular teeth were more uniform than maxillary with respect to buccolingual size relative to mesiodistal. This suggests that the Mesiodistal dimension might be larger for anterior teeth, which are typically smaller in the buccolingual direction. Another document on tooth-size in male American Negroes mentions a 8.4 percent increase in tooth size compared to Caucasians, but this information does not provide direct evidence about anterior teeth specifically. Finally, the document on apical foramen size mentions that the size of the foramen is smaller in smaller types of teeth and larger in larger types of teeth, which could be relevant if we were comparing different tooth types.\n\nBased on this analysis, we can infer that the Mesiodistal dimension might be larger than the Cervicoincisal dimension for anterior teeth. However, we need more specific information to pinpoint the exact tooth type.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
