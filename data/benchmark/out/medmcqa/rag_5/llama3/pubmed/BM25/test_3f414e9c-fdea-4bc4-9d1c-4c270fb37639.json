["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about true/false statements about digoxin toxicity. We need to look for information that suggests or states the early manifestations of digoxin toxicity. From the given documents, we can see that in 'Is a slow pulse-rate a reliable sign of digitalis toxicity?' document, it is mentioned that 64 out of 910 hospital patients taking digoxin had a ventricular rate of less than 60 beats/min, and only 6 out of those investigated further could a diagnosis of digoxin toxicity be made on clinical, electrocardiographic, and biochemical grounds. No reason for the slow heart-rate could be found in 42 patients. This suggests that early toxicity may not correlate with serum levels and neurological symptoms may occur without corresponding cardiovascular changes.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
