["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about a wound that does not involve the dermis. From the given documents, we can see that tenascin is an extracellular matrix molecule that first appears in the scutate scale dermis at 12 days of development. Similarly, the article 'De-epithelization' of the dermal pedicle in a reduction mammaplasty mentions that the term 'de-epithelization' should be abandoned because dermis does remain in the pedicle. This suggests that the dermis plays an important role in wound formation and healing. Therefore, a wound that does not involve dermis is unlikely to occur. Among the given options, only incision (which is a surgical cut) does not directly involve the dermis. The other options (abrasion, contusion, and laceration) are all types of injuries that typically involve damage to the skin and underlying tissues, including the dermis.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
