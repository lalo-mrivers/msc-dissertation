["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has pregnancy induced hypertension with blood pressure of 150/100 mmHg at 32 weeks of gestation. The development of proteinuria is the best predictor of poor pregnancy outcome. As there are no complications, we consider the patient's condition as mild to moderate pregnancy induced hypertension. A randomised placebo controlled trial of labetalol in the treatment of mild to moderate pregnancy induced hypertension showed that labetalol significantly lowered blood pressure and reduced the incidence of proteinuria. However, neither the number of days spent as an antenatal inpatient, nor the perceived need for induction of delivery or elective caesarean section, nor the gestation age at delivery differed significantly between the two treatment groups. Based on this information, we can conclude that controlling blood pressure with labetalol is a reasonable approach. The patient's condition does not meet the criteria for acceleration of hypertension late in pregnancy.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
