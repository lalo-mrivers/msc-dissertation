["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe different types of hydrops. Congenital hydrops caused by Kell alloimmunization is discussed in [A successfully treated case of congenital hydrops by Kell-alloimmunization]. Non-immunologic hydrops fetalis associated with intra-uterine human parvovirus B19 infection is discussed in [Human parvovirus B19 infection during pregnancy. 2 cases]. Endolymphatic hydrops is described in [Development of endolymphatic hydrops following immune response in the endolymphatic sac of the guinea pig], [Pathophysiology of endolymphatic hydrops], and [Endolymphatic hydrops in animal experiments. A confirmation of mechanical and immunological methods of inducement]. Non-immune hydrops fetus is discussed in [Human parvovirus B19 infection during pregnancy. 2 cases] and it is characterized by stillbirths.\n\nNon immune hydrops fetalis is different from the other types of hydrops described. Therefore, we need to look for a condition that is not seen in non-immune hydrops fetalis. Cardiomegaly is typically seen in congestive heart failure which is not related to non-immune hydrops fetalis.\n\nSkin oedema, ascites, and large placenta are all possible complications of non immune hydrops fetalis, as described in [Human parvovirus B19 infection during pregnancy. 2 cases]. Therefore, these options can be ruled out.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
