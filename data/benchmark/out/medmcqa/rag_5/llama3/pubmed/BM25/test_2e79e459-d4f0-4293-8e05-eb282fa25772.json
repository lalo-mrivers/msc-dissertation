["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the composition of a cell membrane. From the provided documents, there are no direct mentions of cell membranes. However, we can relate to the concept of junctions and membranes from the study on adhesive junctions in reaggregates of unincubated chick embryos. The study describes specialized junctions (desmosomes) between primitive endoderm cells. Desmosomes are a type of junction that connects adjacent cells through their cell membranes. This suggests that the cell membrane is involved in these connections.\n\nThe document on voltage clamping with a single microelectrode also mentions the concept of membrane potential, which is the electrical potential difference across a cell membrane.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that cell membranes are composed of lipids and proteins, as they play a crucial role in maintaining cell-cell connections and controlling the flow of ions across the membrane.\", \"answer_choice\": A}"]
