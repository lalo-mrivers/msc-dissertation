["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking what factors affect occlusal adjustment. We can see from the documents that occlusal adjustment is discussed as a therapy to improve the occlusion of patients. It involves grinding teeth to attain an acceptable occlusion without interferences. The technique described in the document 'Occlusal adjustment by grinding of teeth; indications and techniques' emphasizes the importance of diagnosing the occlusal condition and deciding how to attain an acceptable occlusion.\n\nThe documents also discuss various methods of fabricating occlusal splints and the factors that affect occlusal adjustment, such as radiographs of the temporomandibular joint, diagnostic casts, and leaf gauge measurements of unequal bilateral occlusal contact. We can infer that these factors influence the decision-making process for occlusal adjustment.\n\nHowever, we do not find any mention of 'Compensating curve', 'Cusp height', 'Incisal guidance' or 'Postural position' as affecting occlusal adjustment in the provided documents.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: Postural position\"\n}"]
