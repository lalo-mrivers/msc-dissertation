["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is an 8-year-old boy with increasing muscle weakness. His calves are bulky and show muscle tightening. His serum creatine kinase levels are increasing with age. The case report about nemaline myopathy suggests that type 2 fiber predominance can be a unique, rare phenomenon. Considering the patient's age and symptoms, it is unlikely to have rocky mountain spotted fever or denervation of the muscle. Carnitine palmitoyltransferase II deficiency may not be related to muscle weakness.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is nemaline myopathy.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
