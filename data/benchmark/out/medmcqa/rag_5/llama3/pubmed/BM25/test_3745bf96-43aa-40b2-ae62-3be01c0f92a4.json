["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has secondary amenorrhea since a spontaneous abortion. FSH was found to be 6 IU/mL. This is higher than the normal range of FSH response observed in women with primary amenorrhea due to ovarian failure, which presented basal high values of both gonadotropins and increased response to the LH-RH stimulation (The pituitary reserve in FSH and LH in amenorrheic and anovulatory women). This suggests that the patient's FSH level is not indicative of ovarian failure. The fact that the patient has secondary amenorrhea also implies that there may be a problem with the pituitary-gonadal axis, as seen in the Endocrine and cytogenetic studies in a patient with Turner's phenotype and a ring chromosome where augmented FSH response to LH-RH was observed.\",\n\"answer_choice\": A"]
