["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents provided discuss the anatomy and innervation of the digastric muscle. The article 'Re-examination of the topographical distribution of motoneurons innervating the digastric muscle in the rabbit and guinea pig' mentions that motoneurons innervating the anterior belly of the digastric muscle constitute a longitudinal cell column in the ventromedial part of the motor nucleus of the trigeminal nerve. The article 'Localization of motoneurons innervating the posterior belly of the digastric muscle: a comparative anatomical study by the HRP method' states that motoneurons innervating the posterior belly of the digastric muscle were localized in the accessory facial nucleus. No mention is made of the anterior or posterior bellies of the digastric muscle causing movement of the mandible. The article 'Anatomo-topographic characteristics of the masseter muscle' provides measurements of the length and width of fixation of the digastric muscle belly, but does not describe its action.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
