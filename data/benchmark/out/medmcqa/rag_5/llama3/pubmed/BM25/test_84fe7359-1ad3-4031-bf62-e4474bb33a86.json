["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for signs of impending Eisenmenger syndrome. Eisenmenger syndrome is a complication of uncorrected congenital heart defects that allows oxygenated blood to flow from the left side of the heart to the right side, resulting in cyanosis, dyspnea, and other symptoms. The provided documents describe recurrent thromboembolic phenomena, pulmonary thrombosis, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and high peripartal mortality in Eisenmenger syndrome.\n\nThe options provided are all murmurs or sounds that can be heard during a physical examination of the heart. An increased flow murmur across the tricuspid and pulmonary valves is a common finding in patients with Eisenmenger syndrome. A single S2 (second heart sound) is not typically seen in patients with Eisenmenger syndrome, as it is often accompanied by other murmurs and sounds. A loud P2 (pulmonary valve sound) can be seen in patients with pulmonary hypertension, which is a common complication of Eisenmenger syndrome.\n\nThe Graham Steele murmur is a mid-systolic murmur that is often seen in patients with tricuspid regurgitation, which can occur in patients with Eisenmenger syndrome. However, it is not a unique feature of impending Eisenmenger syndrome.\n\nTherefore, the answer to this question is\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
