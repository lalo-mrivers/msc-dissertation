["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with fever, decreased Hb, normal TLC, and decreased platelet count. The peripheral smear shows fragmented RBCs. Based on the symptoms, DIC (Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation) is a possible diagnosis. However, since the TLC is normal, it's less likely to be due to TTP (Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura). HELLP syndrome also has similar symptoms but typically presents with elevated liver enzymes and platelet count below 100 x 10^9/L. Evans syndrome is a rare autoimmune condition characterized by immune-mediated destruction of platelets and red blood cells, which doesn't seem to match the patient's symptoms. Given these factors, DIC seems the most likely diagnosis.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
