["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the maximum masticatory forces taken up by which fibers. From the provided documents, we can see that the influence of occlusal surface material on peak masticatory forces was studied using osseointegrated implant-supported prostheses. It was found that mean peak masticatory forces varied considerably from subject to subject but were consistent within each subject. No differences related to tooth material could be detected in the load rates. Forces directed away from the implants were noted in all subjects.\n\nIn the document 'Application and validation of a three-dimensional mathematical model of the human masticatory system in vivo', it was found that the predicted maximum possible bite forces were between 0.9 and 1.2 times the measured ones, suggesting that the maximum masticatory forces are primarily taken up by the fibers in the mandible.\n\nBased on this information, we can conclude that the maximum masticatory forces are taken up by the horizontal fibers (C) of the mandible.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
