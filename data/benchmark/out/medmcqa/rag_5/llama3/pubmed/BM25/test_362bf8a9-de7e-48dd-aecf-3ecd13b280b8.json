["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the classification of an orthodontic force duration when the level declines to zero between activations. From the provided documents, we can see that the study on 'automatic activation' of labial arch wires during orthodontic treatment with expansion plates shows that progressive activation of a screw plate caused an initial increase in labial archwire force, which was subsequently followed by a minor reduction, and then stabilised after 90 seconds. This suggests that the level of the force declines to zero between activations.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
