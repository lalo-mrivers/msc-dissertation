["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the consequence of apical migration of the epithelial attachment with corresponding recession of the marginal gingiva. The relevant documents describe different types of recessions and pocket formations. Apical migration implies a shift towards the apex, which can lead to visible recession. As the marginal gingiva recedes, it may expose the root surface, potentially leading to pocket formation. Given the options, C: Infrabony pocket formation seems the most plausible outcome.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
