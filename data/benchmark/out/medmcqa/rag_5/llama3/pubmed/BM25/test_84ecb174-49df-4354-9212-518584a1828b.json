["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents provided discuss CMV infection in different contexts. In one study, CMV DNA was detected from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in patients with AIDS. Another study mentions the use of in situ hybridization for diagnosing CMV disease in pediatric kidney transplant recipients, where samples were obtained directly from organs thought to be affected on the basis of clinical findings.

Therefore, it is more likely that the specimen should be obtained from the CSF for diagnosis by PCR.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
