["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about imaging in the primary survey of a trauma patient. The relevant documents are about posttraumatic aneurysms of the hand, hospital and office practices of radiology groups, changes in public concern about transmission of AIDS from dentist to patient after CDC report, nonparasitic true cysts of the spleen, and evaluation and treatment of blunt renal trauma.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom the document 'Evaluation and treatment of blunt renal trauma', we can see that computerized tomography (CT) was used as an imaging study of choice in patients with blunt renal trauma. It was found to be more sensitive and specific than an excretory urogram (IVP).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe document 'Changes in public concern about transmission of AIDS from dentist to patient after CDC report' does not provide information about imaging in primary survey of a trauma patient.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom the other documents, we can find that there is no specific information about imaging in primary survey of a trauma patient.\\r\\n\\r\\nTherefore, it can be concluded that C: Hemodynamically unstable patients should not be sent for CT scan is the correct answer.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"]
