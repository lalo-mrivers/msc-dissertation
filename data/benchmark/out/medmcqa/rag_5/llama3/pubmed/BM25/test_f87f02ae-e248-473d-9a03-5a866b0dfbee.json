["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about LDL receptor. From the given documents, we know that FDB is caused by a G to A mutation at nucleotide 10,708 in exon 26 of the apo B gene creating a substitution of glutamine for arginine in the codon for amino acid 3500. This mutation leads to defective apo B-100. We also know that CO-LDL, modified LDL by cholesterol oxidase, demonstrated enhanced susceptibility to oxidation by copper ions and was taken up via the LDL receptor.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
