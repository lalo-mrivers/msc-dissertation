["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is 36 weeks pregnant with severe hypertension (180/120 mm Hg) and symptoms of hypertensive crisis such as blurring of vision and headache. The blood pressure remains elevated after 20 minutes, indicating a lack of response to conservative management. Given the severity of her condition and the presence of visual disturbances, I would consider termination of pregnancy to be the most appropriate course of action.\n\nThe available literature suggests that nifedipine is effective in reducing blood pressure in hypertensive emergencies, but it may not be sufficient in this case due to the severity of the patient's hypertension. Timolol has also been shown to be effective in reducing blood pressure, particularly when used in combination with diuretics.\n\nHowever, considering the patient's gestational age and the presence of visual disturbances, I would prioritize her neurological well-being over continuing the pregnancy. Therefore, I would recommend termination of pregnancy and management of hypertension with antihypertensives, magnesium sulfate, and other appropriate therapies.\", \n\"answer_choice\": \"C: Admit the patient, start antihypertensives, MgSO4 and terminate the pregnancy\""]
