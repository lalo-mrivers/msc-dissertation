["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the type of failure that may occur if the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) of ceramic is much lower than that of metal. The relevant information from the documents is that a high residual stress in PFM crown can be an internal cause for the failure of the ceramic layer. This suggests that when the CTE of ceramic is much lower than that of metal, it may lead to a tensile stress within the ceramic layer. This stress could cause the ceramic layer to burst apart.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
