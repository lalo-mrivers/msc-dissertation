["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks for characteristic features of superior semicircular canal dehiscence except. A quick scan of the provided documents reveals that the middle fossa approach uses bony landmarks to identify and protect the facial nerve, which implies a connection with the superior semicircular canal. Furthermore, aplasia of the posterior semicircular canal is reported in Waardenburg syndrome type II, while 'Congenital' cholesteatomas developing in the region of the geniculate ganglion are presented medial to the superior semicircular canal. Additionally, a case study on acute vestibular paralysis in herpes zoster oticus shows that disease affecting the lateral semicircular canal is reliably detected by the conventional caloric test, but not necessarily the posterior semicircular canal. In light of these findings, we can deduce that features related to the superior semicircular canal are characteristic, excluding B (SNHL) which does not specifically mention the superior semicircular canal.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
