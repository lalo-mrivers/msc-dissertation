["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the regeneration of spinal cord after a politician is shot in the back. The level of the injury is at T8 vertebral, which means the affected area is below the level of the brain stem's control. After reviewing the documents, I found that when there is a complete spinal transection, axons can regenerate across the scar in hemisected lamprey spinal cord (Preferential regeneration of spinal axons through the scar in hemisected lamprey spinal cord). However, this does not apply to humans.\n\nIn humans, after a spinal cord injury, the scar tissue that forms at the site of the injury can be an impediment to regeneration. The presence of glial scar is likely a factor that inhibits regeneration. Therefore, I conclude that the presence of glial scar is the reason why the injured nerve is not able to regenerate.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
