["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks for a negative acute phase reactant. Acute phase reactants are proteins whose levels increase or decrease in response to systemic injury and infection. In the relevant documents, we can find information about positive and negative acute phase reactants. For example, in the study 'Fetuin: an acute phase protein in cattle', it is mentioned that fetuin is a positive acute phase protein in cattle, while alpha 2HS glycoprotein (the human homologue of fetuin) is a negative acute phase protein. Similarly, in the document 'The effect of aging on constitutive mRNA levels and lipopolysaccharide inducibility of acute phase genes', it is mentioned that albumin is a negative acute phase reactant. Based on this information, we can infer that negative acute phase reactants are those whose levels decrease in response to systemic injury and infection. Among the options provided, Albumin is the one that fits this description.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
