["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the discovery of insulin's structure and amino acid sequence, as well as interspecies differences in molecular structure. After reviewing the provided documents, I found that human insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) displays obvious homology to proinsulin: positions 1 to 29 are homologous to insulin B chain and positions 42 to 62 to insulin A chain. This suggests that the amino acid sequence of insulin has been determined.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
