["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the given documents, specifically [The effect of cavity finishing on the initial sealing capacity of amalgam fillings in vitro] and [Craniometric and gnathometric characteristics of anomalies Angle Class II in deciduous dentition], we can analyze the proximal walls of a class II cavity on a deciduous molar. From the first document, we know that the results indicate that Class-II cavities with minimal extension of the proximal walls can be effectively finished without using hand instruments. This implies that the proximal walls do not follow any specific direction or pattern. In fact, [The tunnel restoration--nine years of clinical experience using capsulated glass ionomer cements] suggests a technique for accessing proximal caries and describes a procedure similar to that of a standard Class II cavity preparation. However, there is no direct information about the shape or orientation of the proximal walls in this context.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
