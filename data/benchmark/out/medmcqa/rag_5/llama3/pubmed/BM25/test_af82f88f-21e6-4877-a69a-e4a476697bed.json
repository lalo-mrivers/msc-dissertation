["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant document is 'Immunologic characterization and quantification of haemoglobin A1c.' It discusses the development of a sheep antiserum against human glycohaemoglobin, Hb A1c. This antiserum distinguishes Hb A1c from the major component Hb A0. The reactivity of the haemoglobins with this specific antiserum is abolished by the reduction of the keto group of the sugar ligand. This suggests that glycosylated Hb is used to assess diabetic patients.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
