However, one of the studies mentions that metabolic and protein requirements are estimated 50-100% in addition to their normal needs for severely burned children. This could be used as a rough estimate for pregnant women. Another study suggests that total parenteral nutrition is capable of reversing the negative nitrogen balance of the immediate postoperative period; this reversal depends on administration of adequate nitrogen and calories.
