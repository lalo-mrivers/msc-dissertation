["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, it can be seen that MRI is better than CT scan for several types of tumors.\\nFirstly, in the diagnosis of bone tumours, MRI gives better contrast and permits multidirectional exposures, making it possible to study the relationship to soft tissues, bone marrow and joints more accurately. \\nSecondly, in Nelson syndrome patients, MRI provides better demonstration of tumour development, such as abnormal convexity of the cranial margin of the hypophysis, displacement of the infundibulum or optic chiasm.\\nThirdly, in the staging of bladder tumors, MRI can distinguish stage T1 from stage T3a tumors and is superior to CT in distinguishing tumors limited to superficial muscle from those that invade deep muscle.\\nFinally, in tumors of the oropharynx, hypopharynx and larynx, MRI afforded a clearer tumor definition through sagittal and coronal slice orientations.\\nBased on these points, it can be concluded that MRI is better than CT scan for several types of tumors.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
