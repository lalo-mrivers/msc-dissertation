["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the effects of injury to the right mandibular nerve as it passes through foramen ovale. Based on the provided documents, we can deduce that the mylohyoid nerve is a branch of the inferior alveolar nerve and enters the mandible through accessory foramina in the lingual side of the mandibular symphysis.
