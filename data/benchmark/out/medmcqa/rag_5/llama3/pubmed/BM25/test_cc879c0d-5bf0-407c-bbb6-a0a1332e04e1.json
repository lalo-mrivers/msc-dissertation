["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the best treatment for high velocity gunshot injury with periosteal denudation & comminuted fracture. From the given documents, we can infer that a low velocity gunshot wound is different from a high velocity one as temporary cavitation does not occur in the former (External fixator use in comminuted gunshot fractures of the proximal phalanx). High velocity gunshot injuries are more likely to cause extensive damage and trauma. Also, periosteal denudation suggests that there may be soft tissue involvement.\n\nSubtrochanteric fractures of the femur: a review of 130 patients states that comminuted fractures (Type III) require specific fixation methods, such as lag screw fixation and supplementary bone graft. Delayed weight bearing is also suggested to ensure primary bone healing without deformity.\n\nConsidering these points, it seems that the patient may need more extensive treatment, including reconstruction plates and closure of fracture, rather than just immediate reconstruction or load-bearing reconstruction plates.\n\n\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B: Reconstruction plates & closure of fracture\""]
