["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the given documents, we can see that there is no net electrogenic transfer at the resting membrane potential (RMP). We are looking for the value of Z when there is no net electrogenic transfer.\n\nIn the document 'Direct measurement of changes in sodium pump current in canine cardiac Purkinje fibers', it is mentioned that a transient net outward current arises when the fiber is returned to K(+)-containing solution. This indicates that the rate of electrogenic Na(+) extrusion increases during this period, which means there is an increase in Z.\n\nHowever, we are looking for the value of Z at RMP, not during the depolarization or hyperpolarization phase. Therefore, we need to look for a document that describes the resting state without any stimulation or changes in ion concentrations.\n\nIn the document 'Contractile activation phenomena in voltage-clamped barnacle muscle fiber', it is mentioned that tension development occurs with depolarizing pulses so small as not to activate the potassium and calcium conductance systems. This suggests that the resting membrane potential is around -30 mV, which matches our given value V=-30.\n\nThe document also describes an S-shaped curve for the relationship between fiber membrane potential and tension developed in response to depolarizing pulses. The saturation value of tension remains constant even when the fiber interior reaches a value of +230 mV, which is well above what may be estimated to be the equilibrium potential of calcium ions (Eca = +120).\n\nThis suggests that there is no significant change in Z at RMP.\n\nFinally, we can look at the document 'Chloride conductance of the amphiuma red cell membrane' for any relevant information. However, this document does not provide any information about the value of Z at RMP.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the given documents and our understanding of the resting state, we can conclude that there is no significant change in Z at RMP, which means Z is likely to be 0.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is B: -20.\",\n\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
