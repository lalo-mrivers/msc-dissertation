["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the component that sensitizes bacteria and virus to UV irradiation. From the provided documents, we can see that nucleic acids are mentioned as being susceptible to inactivation by UV radiation (Mechanism of ultraviolet-induced mutagenesis: extent and fidelity of in vitro DNA synthesis on irradiated templates). This suggests that nucleic acids may be involved in sensitizing bacteria and virus to UV irradiation. Additionally, the Radiobiological inactivation of Epstein-Barr virus document mentions that a large part or all of the EBV genome is needed to initiate transformation, which further supports the idea that nucleic acids are important for UV sensitivity.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
