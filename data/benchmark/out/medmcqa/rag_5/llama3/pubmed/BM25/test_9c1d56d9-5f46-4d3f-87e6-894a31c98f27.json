["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the retraction of a protruded mandible. According to [Orthodontic consequences of mouth-breathing], mouth breathing habits are frequently associated with orthodontic problems and can cause a 'long face' or altered pattern of growth of the mandible. This indicates that the mandible has become protruded due to the abnormal postural position. To retract the protruded mandible, one would need to correct this abnormal postural position. [Bennett movement. A literature review] explains the Bennett movement as a lateral shift of the mandible towards the working side. This suggests that the retractions are more related to the masseter and temporalis muscles rather than the medial or lateral pterygoid muscles, which are primarily involved in movements such as opening and closing the jaw. Therefore, retraction of the protruded mandible is likely done by the Masseter and Temporalis muscles.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: Temporalis\""]
