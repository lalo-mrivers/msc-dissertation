["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The CRISPR-Cas9 system is a mechanism for genome editing that relies on the use of guide RNA to locate specific target sites in the DNA. The Cas9 enzyme then cuts the DNA at this site, creating a double-stranded break. The cell's natural repair machinery can then be exploited to introduce changes to the genome. Specifically, the CRISPR-Cas9 system uses non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) and homologous recombination (HR) for repair.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
