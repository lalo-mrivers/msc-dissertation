["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about acid neutralizing substance in saliva. Based on the provided documents, we can find that the role of secretory immunity in hepatitis A virus infection mentions that neutralizing antibody was detected in fecal extracts from none of three experimentally infected human volunteers and only 1 of 15 naturally infected humans. The single positive human specimen contained occult blood. Only 2 of 19 saliva samples from naturally infected humans had significant viral neutralizing activity. This suggests that the presence of acid neutralizing substance in saliva is uncertain. However, we can find a document about Parotid saliva acid phosphatase in health and disease which states that acid phosphatase levels in serum were diagnostically higher than those from 5 patients who had undergone prostatectomy. The levels for saliva when compared with those from normal subjects could not serve as an index of serum concentration. This does not provide any information about the presence or nature of acid neutralizing substance in saliva.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
