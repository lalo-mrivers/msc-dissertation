["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about immediate composite restoration after intracoronal bleaching. In one of the provided documents, 'pH variation among materials used for intracoronal bleaching', it is mentioned that mixing 30% hydrogen peroxide with sodium perborate creates an alkaline environment. This suggests that H2O2 can be present in the tooth after bleaching. In another document, 'Bond strength of composite resin to enamel bleached with carbamide peroxide', it is stated that carbamide peroxide bleaching reduces the shear bond strength of composite to etched enamel, but removing surface enamel restores bond strengths to normal levels. This implies that H2O2 can affect the bonding process. Therefore, treating the tooth with H2O2 for 3 minutes after intracoronal bleaching is necessary before restoring it with a composite.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
