["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the properties of hydrocolloids, including reversible and irreversible ones. The document 'Accuracy and bond strength of reversible with irreversible hydrocolloid impression systems: a comparative study' mentions that the setting time of irreversible hydrocolloids was not explicitly discussed in this study. However, another document 'Viscosity changes of zinc phosphate cements in setting process (author's transl)' describes how temperature affects the setting time of zinc phosphate cements, which are a type of irreversible hydrocolloid. According to Arrhenius' equation, an increase in temperature causes a decrease in the setting time. Therefore, raising the temperature of water used for mixing would likely decrease the setting time of irreversible hydrocolloids.\",\n\"answer_choice\": A\n}"]
