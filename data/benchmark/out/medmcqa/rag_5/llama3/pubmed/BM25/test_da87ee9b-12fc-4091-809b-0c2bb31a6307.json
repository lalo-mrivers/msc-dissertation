["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the effects of trituration on amalgam. The document 'Influence of certain manipulative variables on the static creep of amalgam' states that the condensing procedure influences creep. Similarly, the document 'Effect of trituration on dimensional changes of dental amalgam' mentions that the variation in dimensional change with trituration is substantial. This suggests that trituration affects the properties of amalgam. The question asks what is adversely affected in mechanical trituration of amalgam. Among the given options, it seems most likely that 'Working time' is adversely affected.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
