["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the centre of rotation during intrusion. The relevant documents are related to biomechanics, but none of them specifically discuss the centre of rotation during tooth intrusion. However, one document (Clinically relevant biomechanics) discusses the mechanics of constructive modifications for intrusion of front teeth, and it suggests that intrusive forces are applied to reduce extrusive forces. This implies that the centre of rotation might be located at or near the point where the force is being applied, which could be either inside or outside the tooth.\n\nConsidering the potential choices, A (Infinity) seems unlikely as a correct answer, as it would imply that the centre of rotation is infinite, which doesn't make sense in biomechanical terms. Choices B and C seem less likely as they are specific points on the tooth surface, whereas the centre of rotation could be anywhere along or near the line of force application.\n\nChoice D (Outside the tooth) might be a possibility, considering that the force could be applied outside the tooth to cause intrusion. However, without more specific information about the biomechanics of tooth intrusion, it's difficult to pinpoint the exact location of the centre of rotation.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
