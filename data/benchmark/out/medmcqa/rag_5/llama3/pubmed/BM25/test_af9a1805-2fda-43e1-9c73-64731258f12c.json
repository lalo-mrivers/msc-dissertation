["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, we need to find the mean blood pressure of the sample population. Given that it is 125 mm Hg, and the standard deviation is 10, we can use this information to determine the range of blood pressures for 95% of the population. We can do this by calculating the Z-score corresponding to a probability of 0.95 (since we want to find the upper 2.5th percentile), which is approximately 1.96. Then, we add and subtract the standard deviation from the mean to get the range: 125 + 1.96*10 = 145 mm Hg and 125 - 1.96*10 = 105 mm Hg. This means that 95% of people would have blood pressure above 105 mm Hg.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
