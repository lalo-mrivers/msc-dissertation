["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about rapid axonal flow in neurons. Studying the documents, I found that TAG-1 is an axonal glycoprotein promoting axon extension. In Developmental expression of the axonal glycoprotein TAG-1: differential regulation by central and peripheral neurons in vitro, it's mentioned that spinal cord neurons isolated from older embryos did not express surface TAG-1 when they regenerated axons in vitro. This suggests that axonal flow is regulated differently by central and peripheral neurons. In A functional barrier to movement of lipids in polarized neurons, it's discussed how a functional barrier at the axonal hillock/initial segment prevents intermixing of membrane constituents. This implies that there are mechanisms regulating axonal flow.\n\nLooking at Studies on the transport of secretory granules in the magnocellular hypothalamic neurons of the rat. II. Action of vincristine on axonal flow and neurotubules in the paraventricular and supraoptic nuclei, I see that intrathecal administration of vincristine sulphate induced impairment in the migration of neurosecretory granules as shown by their accumulation in the perikarya of magnocellular neurons. This suggests that axonal flow is regulated.\n\nConsidering these findings, I think that rapid axonal flow in neurons is mediated by dynein and kinesin, two microtubule-based motors.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
