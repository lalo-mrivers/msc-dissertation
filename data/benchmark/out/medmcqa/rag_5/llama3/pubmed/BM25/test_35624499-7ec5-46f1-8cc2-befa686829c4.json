["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the documents provided, it is clear that folic acid supplementation has been shown to be effective in preventing neural tube defects (NTDs) in pregnant women.

Additionally, the Prevention of Neural Tube Defects study showed that folic acid supplementation can prevent NTDS.\n\nConsidering the patient's history of seizure disorder and potential future pregnancies, it is reasonable to advise her to start taking folic acid supplements three months prior to becoming pregnant, as recommended by the MRC Vitamin Study Research Group. This would ensure that she has a sufficient supply of folates in case of pregnancy, which would reduce the risk of NTDs.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
