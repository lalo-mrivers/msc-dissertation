["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks for the drug that does not belong to the amide group. We can analyze the given documents to identify the drugs mentioned. From the first document, we know about FK506 and its mechanism of action. This drug is an immunosuppressive agent that inhibits the transcription of early T cell activation genes by interacting noncovalently with its receptor. In the second document, we learn about MDL 62208, MDL 62211, and MDL 62873, which are semisynthetic amide derivatives of teicoplanin. These drugs exhibit antibacterial activity against various gram-positive bacteria. From the third and fourth documents, we see that allapinin, ethacizine, ritmilen, kinilentin, obsidan, and finoptin are anti-arrhythmia preparations used to treat atrial fibrillation, while the fifth document discusses 4-amino-N-phenylbenzamide anticonvulsants. Based on this information, we can deduce that all these drugs belong to different groups, but none of them specifically belong to the amide group.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A: Procaine\"\n}"]
