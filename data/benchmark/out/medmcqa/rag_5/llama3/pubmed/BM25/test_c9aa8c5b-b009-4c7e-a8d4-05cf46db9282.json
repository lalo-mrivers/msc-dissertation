["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The case involves morphine-induced retching and vomiting. Morphine 6-glucuronide is a metabolite of morphine with greater emetic potency than morphine. However, the question does not provide information about the presence or absence of naloxone, which abolishes emesis induced by both morphine and morphine 6-glucuronide. Therefore, we can rule out options B (Urinary retention), D (Overstimulation of respiratory centre) as they are not related to emesis. Itching is also unlikely as it is not a typical side effect of morphine-induced vomiting. The mistake dose of 12 mg epidural may have caused an increased response.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
