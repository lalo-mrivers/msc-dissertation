["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about indications for evisceration. Evisceration refers to the removal of internal organs from the body cavity. Based on the given documents, none of the options provided appear to be directly related to evisceration. However, we can analyze each option: A (Malignancy) and D (Expulsive hemorrhage) could potentially lead to evisceration as a therapeutic or palliative measure. B (Panophthalmitis) is an inflammation of the eye socket, which might not necessarily require evisceration. C (Severe globe trauma) refers to damage to the eyeball, but it's unclear if this would directly indicate the need for evisceration. Therefore, no clear indication can be identified from the given options.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
