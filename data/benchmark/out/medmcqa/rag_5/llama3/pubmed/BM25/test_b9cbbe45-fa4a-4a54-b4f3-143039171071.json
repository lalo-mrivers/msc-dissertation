["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the characterization of a monoclonal antibody designated 4G10.3 that immunolocalized to limbal basal cells in rat corneas. The same antibody reacted with a single band of 50,000 molecular weight in rat and rabbit corneal epithelium and 48,000-49,000 in human epithelium. This suggests that the 4G10.3 antibody is specific to limbal epithelial stem cells. Therefore, it can be considered as a universal marker of limbal epithelial stem cells.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
