["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for features that are true about the skull of a newborn. The diploe is a layer of cancellous bone that surrounds the cranial cavity, and it starts to form during fetal development. Therefore, the statement 'Diploe not formed' is incorrect. Similarly, the styloid process usually fuses with the rest of the temporal bone by birth, so this feature is also true. The anterior fontanelle is a normal finding in newborns, as the bones of the skull haven't yet fused together. Mastoid processes continue to develop and pneumatize after birth, but they are present at birth. Therefore, 'Mastoid process is of adult size' is an incorrect statement.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
