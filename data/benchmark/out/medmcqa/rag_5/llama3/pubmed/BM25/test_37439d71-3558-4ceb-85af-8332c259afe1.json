["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Firstly, we need to calculate the anion gap using the given ABG values. The anion gap is calculated as follows: anion gap = (Na + K) - (HCO3 + Cl). Since K is not provided, we assume it's normal (< 4 mmol/L). Therefore, anion gap = (145 + ?) - (25 + 100) = 110. This indicates a high anion gap (> 12). Secondly, the pCO2 value of 40 mmHg suggests metabolic acidosis. Finally, comparing the pH value with the normal range (7.35-7.45), we see that it's slightly elevated, indicating metabolic alkalosis. Therefore, the combination of high anion gap and metabolic acidosis along with metabolic alkalosis suggests a diagnosis of high anion gap metabolic acidosis with metabolic alkalosis.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
