["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the teeth arrangement in Parkinsonism patients. The relevant documents are the first two papers. The first paper mentions nothing about Parkinsonism or dopamine-induced dyskinesias. The second paper discusses metoclopramide and pimozide, which are medications used to treat Parkinson's disease. However, it does not provide information on teeth arrangement. Therefore, we must look at the other documents. The third document talks about mandibular positions in complete dentures according to the calotte principle, but it is unrelated to Parkinsonism patients. The fourth document discusses enamel bond composite restoration of permanent anterior teeth affected by enamel hypoplasia and has no relevance to Parkinsonism patients. Since there are no specific guidelines or recommendations for teeth arrangement in Parkinsonism patients, we can only rely on general principles of denture construction. Based on the first paper, it is recommended that the artificial teeth do not overinclined buccally (more than 30 degrees) and do not migrate more than 5 mm horizontally from the ridge center line. This suggests that anatomic arrangement of teeth would be preferred.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
