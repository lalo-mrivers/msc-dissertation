["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about high copper silver alloy compared to conventional alloy. We need to look at the given documents for information about these alloys. In the first document, we can see that high copper content in silver-copper alloy leads to persistent cytotoxicity. There is no mention of tensile or compressive strength. The second document talks about a new type of amalgam alloy, non-gamma2 alloy, which has low creep and tensile strength but high compressive strength. It does not specifically mention high copper content. Therefore, we can rule out options A and C. Option B is also incorrect as the documents do not mention tarnish or corrosion resistance. The correct option must be related to mercury content.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
