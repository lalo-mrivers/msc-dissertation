["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the mechanism of action of Etanercept, a disease-modifying drug used in management of rheumatoid arthritis. None of the provided documents discuss Etanercept directly. However, we can look for information on anti-CD4 monoclonal antibody, which is mentioned in one of the documents. The document 'Treatment of rheumatoid arthritis with single dose or weekly pulses of chimaeric anti-CD4 monoclonal antibody' states that despite a marked reduction in peripheral blood CD4+ lymphocytes, there was no significant clinical improvement in any of these patients. This suggests that the therapeutic efficacy of anti-CD4 therapy is not directly related to CD4+ T-cell lymphopenia. This information does not provide insight into Etanercept's mechanism of action.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
