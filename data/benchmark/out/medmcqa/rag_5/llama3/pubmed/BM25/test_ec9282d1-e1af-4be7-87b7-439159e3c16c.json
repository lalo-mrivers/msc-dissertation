["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents are about different medical topics such as cervical spinal cord injury caused by a broken acupuncture needle, predentin index, physiatric treatment of pain in osteoarthrosis, the effects of thermal injury on pulpal hydrolases, and paediatric analgesia.
