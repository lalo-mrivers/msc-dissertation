["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Firstly, the patient has a right-sided hearing loss with better speech reception threshold (SRT) in noisy environments. This indicates that the patient's left ear is dominant for sound localization. The audiogram shows a 30-40 dB gap between air-conduction (AC) and bone-conduction (BC) thresholds of the right and left ears, which suggests a sensorineural hearing loss.\n\nRinne's test being negative and Weber's test centralizing indicates that the patient has a conductive component to their hearing loss. The combination of these findings makes me think about retrocochlear lesions such as vestibular schwannomas.\n\nThe patient's symptoms are consistent with bilateral acoustic neurinoma, which is mentioned in one of the provided documents. Therefore, I will choose option D as the correct answer.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
