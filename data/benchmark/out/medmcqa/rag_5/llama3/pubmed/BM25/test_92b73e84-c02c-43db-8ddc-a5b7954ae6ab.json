["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, Burkholderia cepacia was previously known as Pseudomonas cepacia. Therefore, we can look for information related to Pseudomonas cepacia treatment options. In the 'Fourteen-year survival of Pseudomonas cepacia in a salts solution preserved with benzalkonium chloride' document, it is mentioned that some antibiotics resisted by Pseudomonas cepacia. In the 'Plasmids of Pseudomonas cepacia strains of diverse origins' document, it is stated that those strains with greater antibiotic resistance carried large plasmids and were mainly found in clinical and pharmaceutical groups. Therefore, we can infer that Burkholderia cepacia may also be resistant to certain antibiotics.\",\n\"answer_choice\": A"]
