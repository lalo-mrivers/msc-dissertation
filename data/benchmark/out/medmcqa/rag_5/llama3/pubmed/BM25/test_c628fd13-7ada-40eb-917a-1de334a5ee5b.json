["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Firstly, I need to look for any relevant information about heparin antidotes in the provided documents. After reviewing the documents, I found that protamine sulfate is mentioned as a neutralizer of heparin in the first document, and aquocobalamine is discussed as an antidote for cyanide poisoning in the second document. However, there is no direct information about the antidote for heparin in these documents. Therefore, I will focus on the last two documents that are more relevant to heparin. In the fifth document, it mentions the development of an in vivo assay for standardizing heparin preparations, which does not provide information about the antidote. The fourth document discusses the effect of different fractions of heparin on Plasmodium falciparum merozoite invasion of red blood cells in vitro, but again, there is no direct information about the antidote.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
