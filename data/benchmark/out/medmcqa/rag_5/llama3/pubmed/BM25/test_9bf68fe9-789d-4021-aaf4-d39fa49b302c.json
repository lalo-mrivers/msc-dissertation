["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Niacin is a precursor of NAD (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide), which is involved in various cellular processes such as energy metabolism. Riboflavin is another B-vitamin that plays a role in redox reactions. In the provided documents, niacin and riboflavin are mentioned in different contexts, but there is no direct mention of transamination reaction or methyl group transfer. However, it can be concluded from the study on lung fibrosis that niacin attenuates bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis by decreasing poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase activities. This suggests a role for niacin in redox reactions.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
