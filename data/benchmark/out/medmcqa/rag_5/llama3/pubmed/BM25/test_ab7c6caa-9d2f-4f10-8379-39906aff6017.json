["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents suggest that trans-vaginal sonography can be used to detect endometrial abnormalities. The study on Vaginosonographic measurement of endometrial thickness in the evaluation of amenorrhea suggests that an endometrial thickness of 1.5 mm or less is associated with absence of bleeding after a progesterone challenge test. In another study, vaginal sonography was used to detect endometrial abnormality and it was found that if a cutoff limit of 5 mm had been used, 82% of the curettage procedures could have been avoided without missing a single case of serious endometrial pathology. Therefore, based on these studies, it seems reasonable to do trans-vaginal sonography in post-menopausal bleeding when the endometrial thickness is greater than 5 mm.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
