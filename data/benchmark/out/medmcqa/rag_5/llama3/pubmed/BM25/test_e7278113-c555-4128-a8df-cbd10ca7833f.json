["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, we need to find the rate of elimination. Since the drug follows first-order kinetics, the rate of elimination is proportional to the amount of drug present in the body. We know that 75 mg of the drug was eliminated in 90 minutes. To find the rate of elimination, we can divide the amount of drug eliminated (75 mg) by the time it took for the drug to be eliminated (90 minutes). This gives us a rate of elimination of 0.8333 mg/min.\n\nNext, we need to find the initial concentration of the drug. We know that the patient was administered 200 mg of the drug. Since the drug follows first-order kinetics, the amount of drug remaining in the body at any given time will be proportional to the initial concentration and the exponential function of the rate constant.\n\nWe can use the following formula to find the amount of drug remaining in the body after a certain time:\n\nA = A0 * e^(-k*t)\n\nwhere A is the amount of drug remaining, A0 is the initial concentration (200 mg), k is the rate constant, and t is the time (6 hours).\n\nTo solve for A, we can plug in the values we know: A0 = 200 mg, k = 0.8333 mg/min, and t = 6 hours.\n\nAfter some calculations, we find that the amount of drug remaining after 6 hours is approximately 25 mg.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
