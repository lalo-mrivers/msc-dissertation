["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks what will happen when a patient on Metoprolol receives Verapamil. First, we need to understand the action of Verapamil. It is an antiarrhythmic agent that affects the atrioventricular junction and prolongs the refractory period of the atrioventricular node. This suggests that it may slow down the heart rate. Additionally, the case reports show that high doses of Verapamil can cause bradycardia and hypotension. Since the patient is already on Metoprolol, which is a beta blocker, the combination may have additive effects in slowing down the heart rate. Therefore, it is likely that the patient will experience bradycardia.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
