["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents provided describe various processes such as ceramic firing, deformation of alloys, afferent influence on motor unit firing ranges, and mechanisms of active shrinkage in mitochondria. However, the most relevant document to this question is [The change of dimensions in bonded crowns]. This document states that when the crown is faced with ceramic material, there is a reduction in dimension in the mesiodistal direction which is greater than in the buccolingual direction. This shrinkage influences the exact fit of the crown. Therefore, it can be inferred that the maximum shrinkage during firing process in ceramic occurs in the fusion stage.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
