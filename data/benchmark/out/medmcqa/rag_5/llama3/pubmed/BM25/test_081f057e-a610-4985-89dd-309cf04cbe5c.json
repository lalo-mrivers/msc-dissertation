["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the transmission of nociceptive signals. From the given documents, we can infer that nociceptive signals are related to pain or noxious inputs. In the document 'Effects of intrathecal monoamine antagonists and naloxone on the descending inhibition of the spinal transmission of noxious input in rats: study with a new experimental model', it is mentioned that nociceptive discharges were recorded extracellularly in parafascicular (Pf) neurons, and these signals were suppressed by spinal stimulation. This suggests that nociceptive signals are transmitted primarily within the spinal cord.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
