["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents suggest that the sacral parasympathetic inputs to the colon and bladder are composed of non-myelinated and myelinated fibres respectively. In the cat pterygopalatine ganglion, most preganglionic fibres are synaptical on the ganglionic neurons. The circumvallate papilla in rat and mouse contains preganglionic fibers containing clear vesicles that synapse on the soma and stumpy dendrites of the neurons. Additionally, the distribution and origin of substance P immunoreactive nerve fibres in the rat conjunctiva suggests that some of the remaining fibres could be of parasympathetic origin. The pre- and post-ganglionic nerve fibres of the pterygopalatine ganglion and their allocation to the eyeball of rats suggest that preganglionic parasympathetic brainstem neurons dorsolateral to the facial nucleus (i.e. the lacrimal nucleus) can also be involved. Based on these findings, it is possible that preganglionic parasympathetic fibres to the Otic ganglion are carried in nerves from this region.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
