["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, we need to calculate the net filtration pressure using the given data. The net filtration pressure is calculated as PGC - pGC - PBC. PGC is the pressure in glomerular capillaries, pGC is the pressure in peritubular capillaries, and PBC is the pressure in Bowman's capsule.\\r\\n\\r\\nPGC = 42 mm Hg, pGC = 12 mm Hg, and PBC = 16 mm Hg. So, we can calculate the net filtration pressure as:\\r\\n\\r\\nNet Filtration Pressure = PGC - pGC - PBC\\r\\n\\r\\n= 42 - 12 - 16\\r\\n\\r\\n= 14 mm Hg.\\r\\n\\r\\nTherefore, the correct answer is C: 14 mm Hg.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
