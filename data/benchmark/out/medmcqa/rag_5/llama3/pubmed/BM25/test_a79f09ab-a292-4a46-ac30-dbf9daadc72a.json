["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Hypoglycemia is mentioned as a complication of high protein diet. The documents highlight cases where hypoglycemia was caused by liver metastases or tumor shrinkage. In one case, the patient's increased glucose requirements were reduced to normal after chemotherapy. Another case mentions epinephrine withdrawal leading to insulin production and hypoglycemia. These cases suggest that liver metabolism plays a role in glucose regulation. The question asks about enzymes involved in glycogen synthesis. Glucose 6-phosphatase is an enzyme involved in glycogenolysis, which is the breakdown of glycogen into glucose. This process occurs in the liver and is regulated by hormones such as glucagon and epinephrine. Therefore, inhibition of glucose 6-phosphatase would lead to a decrease in glucose release from glycogen stores, resulting in hypoglycemia.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
