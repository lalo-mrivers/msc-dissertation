["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) as a condition characterized by the destruction of platelets due to immune-mediated mechanisms. The articles mention that ITP is often associated with autoimmune reactions, and platelet-specific auto-antibodies are present in many cases. Additionally, it is noted that corticosteroids can be effective in treating ITP, especially when the bone marrow is examined first. Furthermore, the documents highlight that ITP can be a complication of other conditions, such as lymphoma.\n\nBased on this information, we can conclude that ITP is indeed associated with platelet-specific auto-antibodies. This is supported by the fact that the articles mention autoimmune reactions and platelet-specific auto-antibodies in many cases.\n\nRegarding the other statements:\n\n* B: A prolonged bleeding time is not a direct consequence of ITP, as it primarily affects platelet destruction rather than coagulation.\n* C: While corticosteroids can be effective in treating some cases of ITP, this does not mean that all cases are controllable by immunosuppressive treatment. The outcome depends on various factors, such as the severity of the condition and the presence of underlying diseases like lymphoma.\n\nTherefore, option B is the correct choice.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
