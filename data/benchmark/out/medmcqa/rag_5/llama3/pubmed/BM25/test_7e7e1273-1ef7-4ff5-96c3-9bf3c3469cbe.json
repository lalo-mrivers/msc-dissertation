["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents provided are about physical therapy fee schedules, estimation of cell size from pulse shape, feasibility of pulse oxymetry to measure arterial O2 saturation, potentiophotometry, and comparison of descriptive expressions between ILO U/C international classification of radiographs of pneumoconiosis and Japanese classification of pneumoconiosis law. None of these documents mention Doppler's law, Pascal's law, or Poille's law. However, one document discusses pulse oxymetry to measure arterial O2 saturation. This suggests that the Law of Pulse Oxymetry is based on a different principle than the above-mentioned laws.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
