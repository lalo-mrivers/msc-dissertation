["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents mention outer membranes of bacteria (e.g., Proteus mirabilis) and a moderately halophilic gram-negative bacterium. The question asks about the characteristic feature true about the outer membrane of peripheral nerve, which is not explicitly mentioned in the provided documents. However, the characteristics of bacterial outer membranes can provide insights. Outer membranes are typically impermeable to potassium ions (D). Therefore, it is likely that this option represents a characteristic feature true about the outer membrane of peripheral nerves.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
