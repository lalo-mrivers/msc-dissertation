["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to the documents, external cervical root resorption occurred after bleaching. One of the suggested etiological factors is the pH of the bleaching materials. A study showed that sodium perborate is alkaline, and 30% hydrogen peroxide is acidic. Mixing both together can result in an increase in pH over time. However, another study found no correlation between bleaching-induced root resorption and an acidic pH. The documents also mention a case where an attempt to stop the resorption by using calcium hydroxide failed. Additionally, a study on dogs showed that external cervical root resorption was only observed at 3-month observation after bleaching. Therefore, none of the prevention methods mentioned in the potential choices seem to be supported by the provided documents.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
