["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the provided documents, we can analyze the forces acting on bones. In 'A preliminary analysis of the forces in screws in tibial fracture fixation', it is mentioned that if a fracture is incorrectly reduced and a plate fixed across the fracture site, then all of the load during subsequent weight bearing can be considered to be taken by the screws fixing the plate to the bone. An analysis of this extreme situation and determination of the magnitude of the consequent forces on the screws indicate that the screws are in danger of failing due to shear forces but are in little danger from tensile forces. This suggests that torsion (shear) forces can cause fractures.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
