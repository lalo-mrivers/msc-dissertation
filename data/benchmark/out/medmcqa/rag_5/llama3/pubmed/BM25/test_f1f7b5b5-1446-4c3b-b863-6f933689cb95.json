["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, we can see that callus formation is increased by passing an electric current through bone (electrodynamic callus) as described in 'Electrical callus and callus formation by electret'. This type of callus forms first at the negative pole and grows towards the positive pole. Additionally, we know from 'Adaptability of Rhizobium meliloti in callus tissues of alfalfa roots' that nodule bacteria can increase callus formation. However, neither rigid immobilization, movement at fracture site, compression plating, nor intraosseous nailing are directly related to increasing callus formation.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
