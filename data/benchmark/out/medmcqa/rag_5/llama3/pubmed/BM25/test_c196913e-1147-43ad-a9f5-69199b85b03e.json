["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"After reviewing the relevant documents, it can be seen that the question is asking about the best radiograph to obtain a view of the maxillary sinus. From the documents, we can see that Waters view and four-view sinus series are mentioned as being used for diagnosing sinusitis by X-ray. The study 'Diagnosing sinusitis by X-ray: is a single Waters view adequate?' suggests that a single Waters view (occipito-mental) radiograph could be substituted for a four-view sinus series to diagnose maxillary sinusitis, with agreement varying by sinus but being substantial only for the maxillary sinuses. Therefore, based on this information, the best radiograph to obtain a view of the maxillary sinus is likely to be the Waters view.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
