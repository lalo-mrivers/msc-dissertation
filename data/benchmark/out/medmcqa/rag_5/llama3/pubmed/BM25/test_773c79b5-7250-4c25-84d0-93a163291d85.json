["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the position and movement of articular disc of TMJ. From the provided documents, we can see that the main arterial supply of the articular disc was from the bilaminar region and pterygoideus lateralis muscle. The vascular network on the disc surface was related with fluid secretion. Collagen fibers in the disc passed mainly anteroposteriorly. In the anterior and posterior bands, muscular tendon fibers came from the pterygoideus lateralis muscle and superior stratum of the bilaminar region. Therefore, the position and movement of articular disc is controlled by fibers of the pterygoideus lateralis muscle.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
