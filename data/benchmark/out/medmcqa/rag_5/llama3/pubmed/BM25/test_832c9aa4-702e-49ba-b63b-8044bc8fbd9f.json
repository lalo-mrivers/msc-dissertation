["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking which cements are not suitable for cementing acrylic temporary crowns. From the provided documents, it can be inferred that Zinc oxide eugenol (A) and Glass ionomer (C) are possible choices as they have been used in previous studies on temporary cements. However, the document 'Effect of temporary cements on the bond strength of a resin cement' suggests that eugenol-based temporary cements do not affect the bond strength to dentin. Therefore, Zinc oxide eugenol (A) is unlikely to be the correct answer. Glass ionomer (C) is also less likely to be the correct answer as it is commonly used in dental applications. The document 'Adhesion of polycarboxylate cements to dental casting alloys' suggests that polycarboxylate cements are suitable for cementing acrylic temporary crowns, as they show high adhesion strength compared to zinc phosphate cement. Therefore, Glass ionomer (C) is unlikely to be the correct answer. The document 'Effect of cleansing procedures on the retentive ability of two luting cements to ground dentin in vitro' suggests that polycarboxylate cements are suitable for cementing acrylic temporary crowns, as they show high retentive ability compared to zinc phosphate cement. Therefore, Polycarboxylate (not mentioned) is unlikely to be the correct answer.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
