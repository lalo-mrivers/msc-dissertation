["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the properties of Golgi tendon organs (GTOs) and their responses to various stimuli. In particular, they show that GTOs are sensitive to changes in muscle tension and respond differently to active and passive forces. They also suggest that each GTO can signal the contraction of multiple motor units with different physiological properties. Therefore, it is likely that GTOs detect muscle tension.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
