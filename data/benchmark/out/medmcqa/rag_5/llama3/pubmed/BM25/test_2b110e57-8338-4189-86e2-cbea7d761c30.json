["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is diabetic with uncontrolled blood sugar level. He has history of pancreatitis which may indicate a risk of developing insulinoma. The fact that he does not want to take injectable drugs suggests that the patient may be hesitant to use insulin therapy. Therefore, we need to consider oral medications that can help control his blood sugar levels. We also know from the case of maturity-onset diabetes mellitus resistant to insulin but responsive to tolbutamide that some patients may be unresponsive to exogenous insulin. Given these factors, it seems unlikely that a glucagon receptor agonist (Liraglutide) or SGLT-2 inhibitor (Canagliflozin) would be the best choice. Sitagliptin is an oral DPP-4 inhibitor and Pioglitazone is a PPAR gamma agonist, both of which are commonly used for type 2 diabetes treatment. Since the patient has history of pancreatitis, we should avoid using thiazolidinediones (Pioglitazone) due to their potential risk of fluid retention and congestive heart failure. This leaves us with Sitagliptin as a possible option.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
