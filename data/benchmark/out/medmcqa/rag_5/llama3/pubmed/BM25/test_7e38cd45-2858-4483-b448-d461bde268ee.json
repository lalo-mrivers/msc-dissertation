["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about induction agents. We need to look for keywords related to induction in the provided documents. In the document 'Induction of intracellular endonuclease synthesis in Serratia marcescens by agents suppressing DNA replication', we find that agents suppressing DNA biosynthesis, such as nalidixic acid, mitomycin, hydroxyurea and thymine limitation, induced exocellular endonuclease biosynthesis. This suggests that these agents are indeed induction agents.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
