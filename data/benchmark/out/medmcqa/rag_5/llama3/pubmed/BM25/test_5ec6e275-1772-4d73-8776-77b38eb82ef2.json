["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about a drug that has gameticidal action against all species of plasmodium. From the provided documents, we can see that salinomycin is an anticoccidial that affects gametogony and reduces oocyst shedding by 20-70%. However, there is no direct information about its effect on Plasmodium species. We also have documents related to nalidixic acid's mode of action, microbial kinetics of drug action against gram-positive and gram-negative organisms, and pediatric analgesia. None of these documents provide information about a drug that has gameticidal action against all species of plasmodium.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: None of these\"\n}"]
