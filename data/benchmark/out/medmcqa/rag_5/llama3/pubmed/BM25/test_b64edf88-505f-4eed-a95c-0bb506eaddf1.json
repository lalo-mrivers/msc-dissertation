["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant document for this question is 'Exposure of operating room personnel to nitrous oxide during paediatric anaesthesia'. This study measured the exposure of operating room staff to nitrous oxide using body-worn passive atmospheric samplers. The study found that regardless of the induction technique used, the mean nitrous oxide exposures of the anaesthetist, the surgeon and the nurse all exceeded the maximum level of 25 ppm.hr-1 recommended by the United States National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH). This suggests that the most sensitive test for nitrous oxide detection is a method that can accurately measure low levels of nitrous oxide in the air.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
