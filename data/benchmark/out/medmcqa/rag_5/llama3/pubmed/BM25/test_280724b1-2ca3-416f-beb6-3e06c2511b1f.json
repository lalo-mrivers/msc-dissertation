["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The provided documents discuss the properties of various amalgam alloys, including spherical and lathe-cut particles. From 'Studies on Pd base ternary alloys for dental amalgam. (Part 1) Effect of size and shape of particle on dimensional change and mechanical properties (author's transl)' we can see that the dimensional change of spherical particle amalgam is smaller than that of fine cut particle. This implies that less condensing force might be required to achieve a similar result with spherical alloys compared to lathe-cut particles.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
