["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about peg-shaped incisors which taper towards the indsal edge. The relevant document is 'Congenital syphilis in the past: slaves at Newton Plantation, Barbados, West Indies.' It describes Hutchinson's incisors and Moon's molars as specific lesions of congenital syphilis. Hutchinson's incisors are characterized by reduced dimensions and thin enamel in the permanent incisors.
