["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks to find a false statement regarding sensory endings. From the provided documents, we can identify the types of sensory endings mentioned: free nerve endings, glomerular endings, simple sensory corpuscles, Pacinian corpuscles, lamellated endings, and annulospiral endings. We also know that primary endings are multi-branched networks distributed on both nuclear bag and nuclear chain fibres, while secondary endings can take various forms including terminal sensory enlargements.\n\nThe false statement is likely to be related to the characteristics or distribution of these sensory endings. Options A, B, C, and D all seem plausible, but let's analyze each option: Option A mentions annulospiral wrapping the ends, which is consistent with our knowledge of sensory endings. Option B says primary ending is annulospiral, which is not true - primary endings are multi-branched networks. Option C states that primary ending conducts 1a fibres, which is also false - we don't know the exact conduction velocity or fibre type for primary endings.\n\nOption D claims flower spray is secondary, which seems correct - flower sprays (unmyelinated branches) were mentioned as a characteristic of more polar secondary endings.\n\nGiven these analyses, the false statement is likely to be Option B, stating that primary ending is annulospiral. This contradicts our understanding of primary endings as multi-branched networks.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
