["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking when full mouth disinfection is done. None of the provided documents mention full mouth disinfection. However, we can find information about endoscope disinfection procedures in different documents. In 'Experiences and problems in the disinfection of fibre endoscopes', a two-stage disinfecting procedure is described, with an intermediate short-time disinfection using polyvidoneiodine (Betaisodona) between two investigations, and a main disinfection at the end of a series of investigations using glutardialdehyde (Cidex). This suggests that disinfection procedures can vary depending on the context. In 'Investigations into the efficacy of different procedures for surgical hand disinfection between consecutive operations', different procedures are tested for their effectiveness in disinfecting hands, but this is not related to full mouth disinfection. Therefore, we cannot find any direct information about when full mouth disinfection is done.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"None of the above\""]
