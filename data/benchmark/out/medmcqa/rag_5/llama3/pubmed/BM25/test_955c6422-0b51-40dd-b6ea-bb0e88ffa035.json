["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks for what is NOT true about enamel rods. From the provided documents, we know that enamel rods are arranged in different patterns in different layers of the tooth. We also know that the shape and orientation of enamel rods can affect their fracture properties. However, there is no information provided about the length or thickness of enamel rods, nor is it mentioned that the tail is more resistant to caries than the core.\n\nBased on this information, option D 'Tail is more resistant to caries than the core' appears to be true, as there is no mention of a 'tail' in the provided documents. Therefore, this option is likely to be incorrect.\n\nOptions A and B provide general descriptions of enamel rods that are consistent with the provided information. Option C is also consistent with the description of enamel rods being arranged in patterns similar to fish scales under light microscopy.\n\nTherefore, it appears that option D 'Tail is more resistant to caries than the core' is the most likely incorrect answer.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
