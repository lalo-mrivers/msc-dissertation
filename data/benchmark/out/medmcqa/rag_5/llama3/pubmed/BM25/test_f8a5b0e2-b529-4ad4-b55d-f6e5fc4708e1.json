["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks for the positive predictive value of a screening test with a sensitivity of 95%, specificity of 80% and prevalence of disease in the population being 20%. The formula to calculate positive predictive value is PPV = TP / (TP + FP), where TP is true positives and FP is false positives. Since we are given the prevalence of disease, which is the ratio of total diseased people to the total population, it can be used to find the number of truly diseased people. This will help us in calculating the positive predictive value. Let's first calculate the number of truly diseased people: Total diseased people = Prevalence * Population = 0.2 * 10000 = 2000. Next, we need to use Bayes' theorem to find the posterior probability (positive predictive value) given the sensitivity and specificity. This is done by multiplying the likelihood (sensitivity) by the prior probability (prevalence) and dividing by the sum of likelihood (sensitivity) times prior probability (prevalence) plus 1 minus likelihood (sensitivity) times 1 minus prior probability (prevalence).\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
