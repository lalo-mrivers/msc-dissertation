["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the additional period required for enamel calcification after eruption into oral cavity. The relevant documents do not provide direct information about this topic.

The other documents do not provide relevant information either.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
