["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant document that discusses cherry red spot is the first one. It mentions a 14-year-old girl who had bilateral cherry red spots without secure evidence of sphingolipidosis. This suggests that the cherry red spot might not be related to Niemann-Pick's disease, which is mentioned in this paper. The paper also talks about optic ganglion cells and perimetry, which doesn't seem relevant to the question. However, it does mention a slight deterioration of vision and paracentral depression of contrast sensitivity, possibly indicating a relationship with trauma.\n\nThe other papers don't seem directly related to cherry red spot or its causes.\n\nTherefore, the most likely cause of the cherry red spot is related to trauma.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"]
