["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for a biomarker of alcoholic hepatitis. From the provided documents, we can see that one of the studies is about lymphocytotoxicity in patients with alcoholic cirrhosis and acute alcoholic hepatitis. The study found that the mean cytotoxicity index (CI) was higher in patients with acute alcoholic hepatitis than those with cirrhosis. This suggests that there may be an immune reaction involved in the pathogenesis of acute alcoholic hepatitis. Furthermore, the study also found that the test showed a disappearance of cytotoxic activity when using T-enriched fractions of peripheral lymphocytes or after pronase-induced digestion of SmIg of total lymphocytes. This suggests that non-T cells are responsible for cytotoxicity and that the immune reaction is not antibody-dependent.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
