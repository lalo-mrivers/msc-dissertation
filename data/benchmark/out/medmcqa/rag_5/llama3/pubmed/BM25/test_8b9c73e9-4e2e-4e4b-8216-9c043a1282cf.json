["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"In the provided documents, we have several examples of sampling methods used for various purposes. In one document, we see a discussion on taking random samples from a population to estimate brain volume. In another, we see a case study on sampling in epidemiological research and the importance of avoiding bias by using a probability sample.
