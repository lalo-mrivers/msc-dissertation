["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks for a condition where relining and rebasing can be done. From the given documents, we can see that relining is mentioned as a technique to improve the adaptation of denture bases to the ridges (Effect of relining on the accuracy and stability of maxillary complete dentures--an in vitro and in vivo study). Additionally, rebasing is introduced as a method to correct the displacement of denture bases and preserve the original occlusion and esthetics (A complete denture rebasing method in two appointments). The documents do not mention excessive alveolar bone loss or when centric relation and centric occlusion do not coincide. However, they do discuss relining as a technique to improve the fit of denture bases. Therefore, we can infer that the condition under which relining and rebasing can be done is when there is less than 2mm loss of alveolar bone height.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
