["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about supplementary retention on the abutment tooth. The relevant documents are the ones discussing dental prosthetics and abutment teeth. From these documents, we can see that the saddle curvature has an influence on abutment tooth kinetics and stress. Hemisection, tooth separation, or root amputation can be used to utilize a segment of multirooted tooth as a healthy abutment. The selection of retainers in lower overlay dentures can affect the mobility of abutment teeth. Finally, the effect of various clasping systems on the mobility of abutment teeth is also discussed. From these documents, we can conclude that supplementary retention on the abutment tooth is not necessarily related to greater bulk of metal, proper cementation technique, shoulder preparation, or proper use of pins and grooves.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
