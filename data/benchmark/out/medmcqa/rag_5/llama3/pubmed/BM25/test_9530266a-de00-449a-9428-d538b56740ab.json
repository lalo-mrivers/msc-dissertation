["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant document is 'Esotropia following posterior superior alveolar nerve block.' According to this document, the posterior superior alveolar administration of two percent Lidocaine 1/100,000 epinephrine resulted in medial rotation of the orbit (esotropia). This suggests that the posterior superior alveolar nerve is involved. The question asks which structure is pierced during posterior superior alveolar nerve block. Since the block involves the posterior superior alveolar nerve, it must be one of the structures related to this nerve.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
