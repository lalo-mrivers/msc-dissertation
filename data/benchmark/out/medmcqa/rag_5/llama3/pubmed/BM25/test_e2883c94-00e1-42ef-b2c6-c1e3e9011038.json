["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant document is [Association of progressive external ophthalmoplegia and myocardiopathy with complete atrioventricular block. Apropos of a new case]. The document does not provide information about the occulomotor nerve, so we will look at other documents. From [Electron microscopy of the mouse optic nerve: a quantitative study of the total optic nerve fibers], we can see that the optic nerve is responsible for transmitting visual information to the brain and is distinct from the oculomotor nerve. The oculomotor nerve is also known as the third cranial nerve, which controls eye movement. From [Chromatopsia], we can see that the optic nerve is involved in entoptic phenomenon, but this does not provide information about the oculomotor nerve.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
