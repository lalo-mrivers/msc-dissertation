["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question does not provide specific information about the size of the burns. However, we can refer to the relevant documents for similar cases. In the document 'Automobile carburetor- and radiator-related burns', it is mentioned that burns predominantly involved the right sides of the face, head, and torso; the right upper extremity; and the right hand. This suggests that bilateral upper limbs are not exclusively affected in this case. Therefore, we can consider the involvement of only one side of the body for each limb. Burns also involve the front of chest and abdomen, which is a significant area. Considering these factors, it seems reasonable to assume that the burn size would exceed 40% but not exceed 50%. The closest option among the choices is A: 40%\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
