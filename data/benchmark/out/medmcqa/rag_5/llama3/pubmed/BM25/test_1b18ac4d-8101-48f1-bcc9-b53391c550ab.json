["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Acetazolamide is a non-competitive inhibitor of carbonic anhydrase enzyme. Non-competitive inhibitors bind to the enzyme at a site other than the active site and change the enzyme's conformation, reducing its activity. In this case, acetazolamide inhibits carbonic anhydrase by binding to the enzyme and altering its structure, making it less effective. Since Vmax represents the maximum rate of an enzymatic reaction, non-competitive inhibition would not affect Vmax. Instead, it would increase Km by changing the enzyme's conformation and affecting substrate binding.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: No change in Vmax\"\n}"]
