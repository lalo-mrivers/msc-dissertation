["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents discuss various factors that affect glomerular filtration rate (GFR). GFR is increased by factors such as growth hormone, insulin-like growth factor-I, and endothelin-3 at certain concentrations. However, the question asks what decreases GFR. Since there is no information about decreased renal stone in ureter or oncotic pressure affecting GFR, we can eliminate choices C and D. The remaining options are increased renal blood flow (A) and efferent arteriole constriction (B). In one of the documents, it is mentioned that during halothane anaesthesia, the mean GFR decreased by 19% in group B, which suggests that efferent arteriole constriction can decrease GFR. Therefore, we can conclude that option B, efferent arteriole constriction, decreases GFR.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
