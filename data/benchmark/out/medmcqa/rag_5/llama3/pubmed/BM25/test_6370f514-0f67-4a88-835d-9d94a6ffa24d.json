["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the most common pathognomonic sign of mandibular fracture. We need to look for documents related to mandibular fractures. In the 'Arteriovenous fistula and paralysis of mandibular branch of facial nerve following direct wiring of a jaw fracture: case report' document, there are no specific signs mentioned. However, in the 'Diagnosis of pheochromocytoma during treatment of a mandibular fracture: report of case' document, we don't find any information about mandibular fractures. The 'Blunt traumatic iliac vein laceration without pelvic fracture: a rare entity' document is also not relevant to this question. Finally, the 'Erythema ab igne, a sign of pancreatic disease' and 'Syndrome of multiple mucosal neurofibromas, pheochromocytoma and medullary thryoid carcinoma. Report of a case' documents are also not related to mandibular fractures. Therefore, we can conclude that there is no specific pathognomonic sign mentioned in these documents for a mandibular fracture.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
