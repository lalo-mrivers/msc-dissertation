["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe restriction enzymes that cut at specific nucleotide sequences. The recognition sequence of the B. subtilis restriction endonuclease is described as (see article) where arrows indicate the points of strand scission. Each of the four possible nucleotides can occur in the positions flanking the recognition site. This suggests that the enzyme recognizes a sequence with a specific pattern, rather than a fixed sequence like AAGGAA.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
