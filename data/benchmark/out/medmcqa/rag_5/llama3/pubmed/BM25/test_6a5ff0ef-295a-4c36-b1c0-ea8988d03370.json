["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"After reviewing the provided documents, I found that there is no direct definition of midface or its boundaries. However, I did come across a relevant term 'LeFort type fractures' which suggests that the midface region may be involved in such fractures. This led me to look for information on facial fractures and their management. In the document '[Fractures of the facial skeleton]', it is mentioned that LeFort type fractures require immobilization of the mandible and midface complex to the bony calvarium, which implies that the midface region extends from the subnasale to the menton.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: Subnasale to menton\""]
