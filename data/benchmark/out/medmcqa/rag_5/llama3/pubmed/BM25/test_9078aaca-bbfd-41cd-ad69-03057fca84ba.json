["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the characteristic of venous blood flow of lower limb in duplex Doppler. The provided documents discuss various techniques for assessing regional blood flow, including venous occlusion plethysmography and pulsed-Doppler duplex ultrasonography. In one document, it mentions that superimposition of high-amplitude spikes on the normal portal venous waveform is seen in microbubble and clot fragment injections. This suggests that the venous waveform may have a biphasic pattern.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
