["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe obstructive sleep apnoea caused by various factors. In the first document, it is postulated that lingual ulceration resulted from repeated trauma to the tongue by teeth during violent inspiratory efforts at the termination of an apnoeic episode. This suggests that the apnoea itself may be the cause of the condition. In the second document, a patient with obstructive sleep-induced apnoea due to bilateral recurrent laryngeal nerve palsies is described. This implies that anatomical abnormalities can also cause apnoea. The third and fourth documents describe various studies on sleep apnoea syndrome and do not provide information about specific causes of obstructive sleep apnoea. The fifth document describes the relationship between endogenous respiratory rhythm and hypocapnia during sleep, which suggests that factors influencing breathing during sleep may be relevant to the development of apnoea.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"None of the above\"\n}"]
