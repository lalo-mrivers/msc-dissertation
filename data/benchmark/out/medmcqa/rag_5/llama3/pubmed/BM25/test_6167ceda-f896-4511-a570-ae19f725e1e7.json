["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about which type of lipase is controlled by glucagon. There are no relevant documents provided that mention glucagon controlling a specific type of lipase. However, one document does mention that the extracellular lipase activity in Bacillus subtilis cultures accumulates during the logarithmic phase of growth and its induction is triggered by a component of the growth medium. This suggests that the regulation of this lipase may be related to cellular processes such as growth and metabolism. Glucagon is not mentioned in these documents, but it could potentially play a role in regulating this lipase activity.\", \"answer_choice\": B}"]
