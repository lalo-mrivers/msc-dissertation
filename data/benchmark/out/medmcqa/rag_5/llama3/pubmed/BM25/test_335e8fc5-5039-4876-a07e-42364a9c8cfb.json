["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks why glucose-6-phosphate, synthesized during glycogenesis in the cytoplasm of hepatocytes, is not immediately degraded by the enzyme glucose-6-phosphatase. We can start by looking at the relevant documents. In 'Glycogen breakdown in cleaving Xenopus embryos', it is mentioned that glycogen breakdown and glycolysis are activated by the presence of free ADP. This suggests that there may be a regulatory mechanism controlling glycogen degradation. We can also look at 'Glycogen metabolism in the prelaid chick embryo' which mentions two waves of glycogen synthesis and breakdown. This indicates that there is some sort of control over when glycogen is degraded. Finally, we can consider the document on 'Starch degradation by the mould Trichoderma viride'. It shows that enzymes for starch degradation are produced in response to the presence of starch, suggesting that enzyme production may be regulated.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
