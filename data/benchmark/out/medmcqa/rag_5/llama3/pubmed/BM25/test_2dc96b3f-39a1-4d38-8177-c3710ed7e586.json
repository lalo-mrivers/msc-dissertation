["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, it appears that none of the given options (A, B, C, or D) directly address the advantage of metal base denture. However, we can infer from the studies on acrylic denture base material and superplastic titanium alloy denture bases that the surface roughness of metal wires and the adaptability of Ti-6A1-4V alloy plates can affect the fracture resistance and strength of the denture base materials. This suggests that metal base dentures may offer some benefits in terms of mechanical properties, but these are not explicitly stated in the provided documents.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
