["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, there is no information that directly relates to a patient diagnosed with oral cancer of stage T3N2M0. However, I can analyze the common themes and treatment approaches mentioned in the documents. The first document discusses carcinoma of the common bile duct and pancreatoduodenectomy as the treatment approach. The second document reviews the possibility of secondary carcinoma following treatment of Hodgkin's disease, but does not provide specific information on treatment options for oral cancer. The third document presents data on squamous cell carcinoma of the upper aerodigestive tract in patients 40 years of age and younger, but does not provide information on the specific stage or treatment approach. The fourth document discusses breast cancer during pregnancy, but does not provide information on oral cancer. The fifth document presents a case of amyloidosis diagnosed from changes in the oral cavity mucosa, but does not provide information on treatment options for oral cancer.\n\nBased on this analysis, I can infer that surgery is likely to be a part of the treatment approach for oral cancer, as it is mentioned as a treatment option in the first document. However, there is no direct evidence to support or refute the other treatment options (radiotherapy, chemotherapy alone, or combination therapy). Therefore, my answer choice will be based on this inference and the available information.\n\nThe patient diagnosed with oral cancer of stage T3N2M0 may require a comprehensive treatment approach that includes surgery, as well as potentially radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy. Based on this analysis, I choose option D: Surgery + chemotherapy.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
