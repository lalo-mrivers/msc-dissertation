["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about Pterion. After reviewing the relevant documents, I did not find any information that directly answers this question. However, I can attempt to deduce an answer by analyzing the anatomy of the skull. The document 'Histidinol dehydrogenase from salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli.' does mention 'bregma' and 'lamba', which are terms used in anatomical descriptions of the skull.
