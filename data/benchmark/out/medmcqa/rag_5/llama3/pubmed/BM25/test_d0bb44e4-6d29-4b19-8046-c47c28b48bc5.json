["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"After reviewing the provided documents, it is clear that there is no direct information about the composition of dentin. However, we can look for relevant information on the morphology and treatment of the smear layer. In one of the documents, 'Dentin bonding agents and the smear layer', there is a mention of the morphology of the smear layer. This suggests that the composition of dentin may be related to its structure. Further research is required to accurately determine the percentage of inorganic components.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
