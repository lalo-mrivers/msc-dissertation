["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking which hormone increases the sensitivity of heart to epinephrine. We can analyze the provided documents to find the answer.\\nFrom [Hormonal regulation of the heart in aging], we know that adrenaline and thyroxine lead to an increase in the blood minute and stroke volume, arterial pressure, cardiac index and left ventricular work index, maximum rate of intraventricular pressure growth, maximum rate of myocardial fiber shortening, and in the contractility index.\\nThis suggests that thyroxine has a direct effect on increasing the sensitivity of the heart to epinephrine.\\nIn [Cardiac effects of caloric restriction-mechanisms and potential hazards], we find that increased cardiac sensitivity to adrenergic stimulation may also constitute a means to increase heart performance in situations with augmented circulatory demands, which further supports the idea that thyroxine increases the sensitivity of the heart to epinephrine.\\nTherefore, based on the provided documents, it is likely that thyroid hormones are responsible for increasing the sensitivity of the heart to epinephrine.\\nBased on this analysis, we can confidently choose option C: Thyroid as the answer.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"]
