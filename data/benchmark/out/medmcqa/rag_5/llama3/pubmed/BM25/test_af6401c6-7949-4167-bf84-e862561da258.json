["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to the documents, the dorsal column stimulation inhibits the evoked potential responding to sciatic stimulation by about 30-45% of its amplitude. This effect is observed regardless of whether the stimulation is lateral or anterior. Additionally, following bilateral dorsal tractotomy cranial, caudal or both to the stimulating point, the CEM evoked potentials responding to sciatic stimulation are also inhibited by dorsal column stimulation. These findings suggest that the inhibitory modulating mechanism by dorsal column stimulation for pain relief is not only mediated through the dorsal column but also through other ascending spinal pathways.\n\nThe documents also highlight the importance of the dorsal columns in transmitting proprioceptive and vibratory information from the periphery to the cortex. The study on cortical evoked responses shows that selective segmental lesions of the dorsal columns result in almost total attenuation of the cortical evoked potential responses to peripheral nerve stimulation, whereas isolated segmental dorsal column preservation shows intact transmission of the evoked responses.\n\nFinally, the study on spinal neurons projecting to the dorsal column nuclei suggests that these neurons are mainly located in lamina IV and medially in more ventral laminae of the dorsal horn. The dorsal column nuclei receive both ascending dorsal root fibers and a more complexly integrated spinal input.\n\nBased on this information, it appears that all types of sensory information except touch are carried by the dorsal column.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
