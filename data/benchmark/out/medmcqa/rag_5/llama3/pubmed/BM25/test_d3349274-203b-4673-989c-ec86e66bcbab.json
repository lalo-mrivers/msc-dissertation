["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the motor supply of infrahyoid muscle. We need to analyze the relevant documents for information about the motor innervation of infrahyoid muscles. The document 'Motor innervation of the flexor pollicis brevis: an electromyographic study' provides information about the motor innervation of the flexor pollicis brevis muscle, which is different from infrahyoid muscles. However, it mentions that the most common pattern of innervation for both heads of the flexor pollicis brevis muscle was exclusive ulnar nerve supply. There is no direct information about the motor supply of infrahyoid muscle in this document. The other documents do not provide relevant information about the motor supply of infrahyoid muscles.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
