["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking why nitrous oxide alone is not used as a general anesthetic (G.A) agent. The relevant documents describe the effects of nitrous oxide on behavioral performance, amnesic properties, analgesia, and placental transfer. Nitrous oxide has been shown to have measurable decrements in psychological tests, cause decrements in visual perception, immediate memory, and divided attention tasks, and has analgesic properties.
