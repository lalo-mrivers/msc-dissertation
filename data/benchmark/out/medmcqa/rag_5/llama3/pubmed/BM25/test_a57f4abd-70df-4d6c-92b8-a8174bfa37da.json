["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 50 year old tall thin smoker presenting with dyspnoea and palpitations. The ECG was done but the details are not provided. However, we can rule out diabetes mellitus and Marfan syndrome as the patient's symptoms and signs do not match those conditions. Polyarthritis is also unlikely as it is not a common cause of dyspnoea and palpitations. Ventricular tachycardia is possible given the patient's age and smoking history. The ECG findings are not specified but given the presence of dyspnoea, we can assume that the rhythm is likely to be wide complex. This favours ventricular tachycardia over atrial fibrillation or multifocal atrial tachycardia. AV nodal re-entrant tachycardia is also unlikely as it typically presents with a narrow QRS complex.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
