["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the sensory nerve supply of the capsule of TMJ. We need to analyze the documents provided. The first document talks about ultrastructural changes in joint capsule in TMJ disturbance syndrome. It doesn't mention anything about the sensory nerve supply. The second document discusses the sensitive nerve endings of the clitoris, but it's not related to the TMJ. The third document is about microtopography of cerebellopontine angle structures in acoustic neuroma, which is also unrelated to the TMJ. The fourth document talks about the structure and function of the temporomandibular joint, but doesn't mention the sensory nerve supply of the capsule. Finally, the fifth document discusses clinical evaluation of TMJ arthroplasties with insertion of articular eminence prosthesis on ninety patients. It provides information about the TMJ, but again, it doesn't mention the sensory nerve supply of the capsule. Based on these documents, we can conclude that there is no direct information available about the sensory nerve supply of the capsule of TMJ.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
