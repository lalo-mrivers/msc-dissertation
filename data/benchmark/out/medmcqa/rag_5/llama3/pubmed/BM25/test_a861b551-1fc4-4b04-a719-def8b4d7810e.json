["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant document for this question is 'Increase in arch perimeter due to orthodontic expansion'. According to the mathematical model developed in this study, increasing midline arch length by incisor advancement was nearly four times as effective in increasing arch perimeter as was molar expansion. This suggests that a 1Â° labial inclination of lower incisors would have a significant effect on arch length.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C: 1.0 mm\"\n}"]
