["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the role of serum lipoproteins in steroidogenesis by the human fetal adrenal cortex. According to this document, the highest rate of secretion of steroids by fetal adrenal tissue occurred when both ACTH and whole human serum were present in the culture medium.

Therefore, the maximum steroid produced by fetal adrenal is likely to be a hormone synthesized de novo from cholesterol.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
