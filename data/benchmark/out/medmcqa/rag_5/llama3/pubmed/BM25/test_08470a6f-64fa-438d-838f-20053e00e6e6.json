["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"There are no specific studies on mandibular first molars mentioned in the provided documents. However, we can draw some general conclusions from the study on the location and incidence of accessory pulpal canals in periodontal pockets. According to this study, mandibular premolars and mandibular molars had the highest percentage of teeth exhibiting accessory canals. Additionally, the study on three-dimensional observations of accessory canals in mature and developing rat molar teeth suggests that accessory canals often appear in the gaps or slits formed by the approaching epithelial root sheaths during initial root formation. This information can be applied to mandibular first molars as well.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
