["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the injuries sustained by 2 persons who died after a bomb blast in Delhi. The relevant documents describe the effects of bomb blasts on humans. According to these documents, the primary concern is head and neck trauma, including fractures, lacerations, burns, and eye and ear injuries (document 1). Fractures are common and often multiple. Penetrating trunk wounds carry a grave prognosis. Primary blast lung is rare. The document also suggests that there may be some degree of internal organ damage due to the transmission of energy impact waves into the body.\n\nDocument 2 describes an analysis of fractures treated in a hospital, including those caused by gunshot wounds and bomb injuries. This implies that some degree of internal organ damage can occur.\n\nDocument 3 reports on injuries sustained by patients following recent bomb explosions. It mentions that bomb injuries may be divided into three main groups: the blast effect (such as blast lung and ruptured tympanic membranes), the flash (such as burns to the exposed part of the body), and shrapnel (which may cause a wide variety of injuries).\n\nDocument 4 explores whether the \"water bombs\" dropped by an airplane can cause blast injuries. It concludes that the impact of the water bomb can cause changes in internal organs characteristic of primary blast injury.\n\nBased on this analysis, it is likely that some degree of internal organ damage occurred due to the transmission of energy impact waves into the body, but there is no clear indication of primary blast lung or other specific types of internal organ damage.\n\nTherefore, option A: Injuries occurred due to burns and air blast does not seem correct. Option B: Force of explosion decreases rapidly is supported by the documents, which suggest that the force of the explosion decreases rapidly with distance from the epicenter. Option C: Force of explosion is directional is also supported, as the directionality of the force can cause different types of injuries depending on where the person is located relative to the blast.\n\nOption D: Bruise, laceration, fractures are triad of main explosive injuries seen seems unlikely given the complexity and variety of injuries described in the documents. In fact, primary blast lung is mentioned as a rare condition.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
