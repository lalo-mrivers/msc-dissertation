["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to the provided documents, it is crucial to handle avulsed teeth quickly and effectively. In the first document 'Preserving avulsed teeth for replantation', it states that even when extraoral time was 120 minutes or more, 91 percent of the teeth showed excellent or moderate success. This suggests that prompt action is necessary to ensure a successful outcome.\n\nThe second document 'Replantation of avulsed teeth. A review.' emphasizes the importance of immediate replacement and treatment. It recommends washing the tooth, replacing it immediately, and performing endodontic therapy if there is a delay of more than two hours.\n\nIn the third document 'An investigation of replantation of traumatically avulsed permanent incisor teeth', the method of storing the avulsed tooth is found to have a significant relationship with success. Milk, saliva, or saline are recommended as storage media.\n\nThe fourth document 'Arranging artificial teeth according to anatomic landmarks' does not provide relevant information for this specific situation.\n\nConsidering these documents, it can be inferred that the priority should be on prompt reimplantation rather than sterilization or endodontic therapy. However, without further information about the tooth's condition and the patient's overall health, a more detailed plan cannot be determined.\n\nBased on the provided documents, the most suitable option is A: Scrub the tooth and reimplant.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
