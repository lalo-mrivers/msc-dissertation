["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the spring back bending properties of super-elastic NiTi and non-super elastic NiTI wires. From the document '[A pseudoelastic NiTi uprighting spring for the molars--its design, biomechanical testing and clinical use]', we can see that recent measurements have shown that a super-elastic wire (Sentalloy, 0.016'' x 0.022'') having a length of 10 mm generates a constant moment within a specific deformation range. This indicates that the wire exhibits spring-back properties. On the other hand, non-super-elastic wires do not have this property. Therefore, it is reasonable to compare the spring back bending properties between these two types of wires.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
