["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 5-year-old child with brown-colored urine and oliguria since 3 days. Mild facial puffiness and pedal edema are present along with 3+ proteinuria, BP 126/90. Urine examination shows RBCs 100/hpf and granular casts. Based on the symptoms and laboratory results, we can rule out pre-renal azotemia as there is no evidence of fluid overload or recent diuretic therapy. The presence of RBCs and granular casts in the urine suggests glomerular damage. The patient's age and clinical presentation make post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis a possible diagnosis. However, we need to consider other possibilities such as IgA nephropathy or membranous glomerulonephritis.\n\nThe absence of hematuria in the previous urinalysis suggests that this is not a case of minimal change disease. FSGS typically presents with nephrotic-range proteinuria and hypertension, which is not consistent with the patient's clinical presentation.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that membranous glomerulonephritis does not present with this finding.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
