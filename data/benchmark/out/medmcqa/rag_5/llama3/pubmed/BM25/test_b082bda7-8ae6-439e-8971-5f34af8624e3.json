["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the given documents, we can understand that there is a study on cardiopulmonary exercise, which describes how the body responds to exercise. The 'Immediate cardiac response to exercise' document suggests that during exercise, heart rate and corrected ejection time increase, pre-ejection period and PEP/LVET decrease, and pulse transmission time remains stable. This information helps us understand how blood flow and other physiological parameters change during exercise.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
