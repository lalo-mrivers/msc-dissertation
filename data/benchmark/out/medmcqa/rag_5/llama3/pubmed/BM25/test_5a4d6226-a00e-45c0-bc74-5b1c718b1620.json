["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the given documents, it can be inferred that baroreceptor mechanisms controlling sympathetic nervous rhythms of central origin demonstrate a 1:1 relation to the cardiac cycle. Baroreceptor denervation unlocking this phase relation and abolishing the slow wave during less than 1 percent of the cardiac cycle suggests that baroreceptor reflexes entrain the sympathomotor rhythm to the cardiac cycle, rather than being part of a negative feedback loop.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
