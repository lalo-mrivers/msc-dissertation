["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the provided documents, it is evident that T-lymphocytes play a role in various immune responses. In the first document, gamma delta T-lymphocytes were found to be rare in granulomatous lesions of patients with sarcoidosis and tuberculosis, indicating that alpha beta T-cells are predominantly involved in these reactions. In the second document, autologous and normal homologous bone marrow myeloid colony formation was inhibited by the patient's T-lymphocytes, suggesting a role for T-lymphocytes in immune pancytopenia. The third document highlights the involvement of T-lymphocytes in the development of histaminergic hyperreactivity of airways after endotoxin administration to guinea-pigs. Additionally, activated CD4-positive T-lymphocytes were found to be involved in the inflammatory reaction observed in the asthmatic bronchial mucosa.\n\nThe role of T-lymphocytes can be categorized into two main functions: activation and regulation of immune responses, and delayed hypersensitivity reactions. These functions are consistent with the options provided, but do not fit well with production of antibodies, activation of complement system, or immediate hypersensitivity.\n\nBased on these findings, option B: Production\tof\tlymphokines\tand\tdelayed hypersensitivity is the most plausible answer.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
