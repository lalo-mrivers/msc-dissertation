["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the connective tissue width around an implant, but none of the provided documents directly address this topic. However, we can look for relevant information on connective tissue width in grafting procedures or mucogingival junctions. In 'Histologic changes following the grafting of connective tissue into human gingiva', biopsies of grafts at the newly created mucogingival junction showed a normal architecture with keratinized epithelium, except over scar tissue where rete-peg formation was absent. This suggests that the width of the keratinized mucosa increased due to grafting connective tissue from the palate. In 'Osseous repair of an infrabony pocket without new attachment of connective tissue', junctional epithelium was present on the root surface, indicating a normal width of connective tissue between the new bone and root surface. The other documents do not provide information on connective tissue width. Based on these findings, we can infer that the connective tissue width around an implant is likely to be within a normal range.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
