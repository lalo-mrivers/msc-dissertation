["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the differences between an enamel hatchet and a chisel. The provided documents do not directly discuss enamel hatchets or chisels. However, we can analyze the techniques mentioned in the documents to infer some characteristics of these instruments. The document '[Specificity of hatchet flaps in the laterofacial region]' mentions that the hatchet flap is adapted to the laterofacial region and has a simple, harmonious adaptation. This suggests that the hatchet may have a curved or angled blade. The document 'Reconstruction of bony canal with autogenous bone graft' does not mention chisels or hatchets but discusses techniques for preserving the bony posterior wall of the external auditory canal. Finally, the document '[Structural differences shown in enamel of deciduous and permanent teeth]' does not discuss instruments at all.\n\nBased on this analysis, it is likely that an enamel hatchet has a curved or angled blade, as suggested by the description of the hatchet flap. This characteristic differentiates the hatchet from a chisel which typically has a straight and flat blade.\n\nFrom these documents, we can exclude options B, D as they are not related to the shape or orientation of the instrument's blade. Option C is also incorrect as a chisel by definition has a blade that is perpendicular to its handle. Therefore, the only option left is A: Curved in one plane only.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
