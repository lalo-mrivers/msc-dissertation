["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, atropine sulphate is mentioned as a separate entity from pralidoxime mesylate (P2S) and glycopyrrolate. In the study 'Glycopyrrolate methobromide: 2. comparison with atropine sulphate in anaesthesia', it is stated that intramuscular administration of atropine 0.4 mg produced the same degree of tachycardia as glycopyrrolate, although atropine tended to cause no change in pulse rate or even produce bradycardia in a greater number of patients. This suggests that atropine can indeed cause bradycardia. The other options (decreased salivation, decreased sweating and mydriasis) are all consistent with the effects of muscarinic antagonists like atropine.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
