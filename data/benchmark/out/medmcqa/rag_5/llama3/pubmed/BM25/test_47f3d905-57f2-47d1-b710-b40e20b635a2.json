["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents provide information about the Apnea/Hypopnea Index (AHI) for patients with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome. According to [Effects of uvulopalatopharyngoplasty in obstructive sleep apnea syndrome], after three months, the average AHI decreased from 352.2 +/- 138.2 to 182.2 +/- 140.4 episodes/hr. Although only 51.6% patients had a reduction of AHI greater than 50%, most patients had subjective improvement of clinical symptoms. No specific information is provided about mild sleep apnea, but we can infer that the threshold for mild sleep apnea is likely lower than 30.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
