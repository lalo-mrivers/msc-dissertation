["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe various types of metastasis. In the document 'Metastatic colon carcinoma to oral soft tissues', it is mentioned that metastasis occurs rarely from a distant primary tumor to the oral soft tissues, and lung and breast are the most common primary sites.

In the document '[Metastasis from the colon to the choroid (author's transl)]', it is stated that in about 70% of all cases the primary site is breast or lung for metastatic carcinoma of the eye. Therefore, considering both documents, we can conclude that the most common sites for intraocular metastasis are likely breast and lung.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
