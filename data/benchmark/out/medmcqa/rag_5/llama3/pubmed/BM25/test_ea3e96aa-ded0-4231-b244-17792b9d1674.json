["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The term 'rhabdomyoma' is derived from the Greek words 'rhabdos', meaning rod or staff, and 'myoma', meaning tumor. The most common site of occurrence is in the heart, specifically the ventricular apex. Ultrastructurally, the rhabdomyoma cells have a central, deeply-indented nucleus surrounded by an admixture of mitochondria and sarcomeres, which is consistent with striated muscle tissue. Additionally, the presence of satellite cells sharing a common basement lamina apposed to the rhabdomyoma cells suggests that the proliferation of the rhabdomyoma cells may be accomplished by differentiation of these satellite cells, a process known to occur in skeletal muscle. Furthermore, the ultrastructural features described are similar to those found in Purkinje cells, which are a type of striated muscle cell.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
