["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The provided documents do not specifically address the effect of rate of loading on mechanical properties. However, we can consider the studies that discuss strain rates. In 'The response of equine cortical bone to loading at strain rates experienced in vivo by the galloping horse', it is shown that increasing strain rates initially result in increased mechanical properties. Beyond a critical value, further increases in strain rate result in lower strain to failure and energy absorbing capacity. This suggests that high strain rates can have a negative effect on mechanical properties. Therefore, if the rate of loading is decreased, we would expect the mechanical properties of the material to...\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
