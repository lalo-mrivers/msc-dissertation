["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about features of reversible cell injury. We have to go through the relevant documents. Let's look at 'Donor heart valves: electron microscopic and morphometric assessment of cellular injury induced by warm ischemia.' This document talks about the effects of warm ischemic time on valvular cellular injury. It describes the changes in cells as a function of warm ischemic time, including cell disruption, dilation of endoplasmic reticulum, cytoplasmic edema, nuclear and mitochondrial changes. We can see that some of these changes are described as 'reversible' or 'irreversible'.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
