["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about evaluating post-operative vision effects after cataract extraction surgery. The relevant documents mention various studies on cataract extraction and its outcomes. One study mentions the first-year post-operative course of 14 patients who underwent perforating keratoplasty (PK) for secondary endothelial atrophy, which suggests that PK can improve visual acuity in some cases. Another study discusses the results of cataract extraction following glaucoma surgery, with a focus on improving vision and preserving filtration blebs. No surveillance methods are explicitly mentioned in these studies. Therefore, we should look for similar studies or general guidelines on post-operative care.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: Routine checkup of all operated cases\""]
