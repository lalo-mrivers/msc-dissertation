["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the level at which the spinal cord ends in an adult. The relevant document is 'The vertebral level of origin of spinal nerves in the rat'. It states that the spinal cord terminated at the level of the intervertebral disc between the third and fourth lumbar vertebrae, not between the fourth and fifth lumbar vertebrae as previously reported.
