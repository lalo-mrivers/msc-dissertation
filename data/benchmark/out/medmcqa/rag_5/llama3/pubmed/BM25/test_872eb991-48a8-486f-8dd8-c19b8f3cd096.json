["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about anesthetic agents that can cause pain on IV administration. Upon reviewing the provided documents, we see that none of the specific anesthetic agents mentioned (e.g., lidocaine, 2 to 3 ml of long-acting anesthetic) are linked to causing pain on IV administration. However, the document 'Relieving pain with nerve blocks' mentions '1% lidocaine' as a substance used in stellate ganglion blocks. This doesn't indicate that lidocaine causes pain on IV administration, but rather its use as an anesthetic agent. Therefore, we need to look at other options.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
