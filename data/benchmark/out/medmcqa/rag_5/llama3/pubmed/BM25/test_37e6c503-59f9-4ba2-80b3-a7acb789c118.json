["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about contraindicated intravenous anesthetic agents in epileptic patients posted for general anaesthesia. We need to look at the documents provided. The first document mentions the risk of convulsions occurring in susceptible patients following the use of the new anaesthetic agents which are capable of inducing CNS excitability. This suggests that some agents might be contraindicated in epileptic patients. The second document discusses propofol's pro- or anticonvulsive action being unclear, and some groups found shortened convulsing times in patients undergoing electroconvulsive therapy with propofol instead of methohexitone. This implies that propofol might have a potential to trigger seizures. The third document is about local anaesthesia with intravenous analgesia as an alternative to general anaesthesia for medically compromised patients, but it doesn't provide information relevant to the question.\", \"answer_choice\": C}"]
