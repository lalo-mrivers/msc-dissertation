["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the ratio of chest compressions and breaths when a lone person is giving cardiopulmonary resuscitation. From the documents provided, we can see that 'Chest compressions' are mentioned in [Cardiopulmonary arrest] and 'artificial ventilation' is also mentioned. In the study of chest compression rates during cardiopulmonary resuscitation in humans, it is mentioned that patients with cardiac arrest received external chest compressions, initially in the usual fashion without rate direction and then with rhythmic audiotones for rate direction at either 80 compressions per minute or 120 compressions per minute. There is no specific mention of breaths or ventilation rates. However, we can see from the document 'Oxygenation and ventilation during cardiopulmonary resuscitation utilizing continuous oxygen delivery via a modified pharyngeal-tracheal lumened airway' that excellent ventilation was possible in anesthetized, apneic, and paralyzed dogs in normal sinus rhythm from the 'bellows' effect of chest compressions. This suggests that the ratio of breaths to chest compressions is not explicitly stated.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
