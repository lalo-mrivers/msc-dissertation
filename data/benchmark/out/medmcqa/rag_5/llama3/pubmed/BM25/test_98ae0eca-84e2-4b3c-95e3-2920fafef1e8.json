["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, I looked for information about the incidence of multiple canals in mandibular premolars. The document 'The radiographic incidence of multiple roots and canals in human mandibular premolars' mentions that 15.7% of patients had first premolars with divided roots or canals, while 7% had second premolars with divided roots or canals. Another document, 'Root canal morphology of mandibular premolars', describes the frequency of apical foramina and transverse anastomoses in both first and second premolars. Additionally, the document 'The incidence of mandibular premolars with more than one root canal in a Turkish population' reports that 27.76% of mandibular premolars had more than one root canal. Finally, the document 'Root canal configuration of the mandibular first premolar' describes the shape and type of canals found in this tooth.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
