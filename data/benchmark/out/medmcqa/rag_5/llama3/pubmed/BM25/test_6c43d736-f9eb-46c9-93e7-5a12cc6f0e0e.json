["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about a patient who has a history of thrombocytopenic purpura and is now reporting for extraction. Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura is a rare but serious haematological disease that can cause bleeding complications.

The literature suggests that platelet recovery is usually complete in less than 60 days, and splenectomy should not be considered until at least two months have passed.
