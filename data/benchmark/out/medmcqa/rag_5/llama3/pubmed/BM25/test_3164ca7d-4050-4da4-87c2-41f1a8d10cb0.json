["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The article 'A scanning electron microscopic study on the distribution of peritubular dentine in cheek teeth of Cervidae and Suidae (Mammalia, Artiodactyla)' does not directly discuss 'eburnation' of the dentine. However, it does mention variations in volume and distribution of peritubular dentine between different dentinal regions for achieving and maintaining a functional occlusal surface. This suggests that changes in dentine structure can occur. The term 'eburnation' is not explicitly mentioned in this article. Therefore, we cannot directly conclude which type of lesion 'eburnation' is seen.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
