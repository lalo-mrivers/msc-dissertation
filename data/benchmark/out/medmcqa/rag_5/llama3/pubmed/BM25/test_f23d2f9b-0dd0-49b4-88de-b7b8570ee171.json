["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the documents provided, we can see that BCL-2 is associated with blocking apoptosis. In the study 'Involvement of BCL-2 in glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis of human pre-B-leukemias', high levels of BCL-2 expression result in inhibition of cellular proliferation without induction of apoptosis. This suggests that BCL-2 is involved in increasing cell survival.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
