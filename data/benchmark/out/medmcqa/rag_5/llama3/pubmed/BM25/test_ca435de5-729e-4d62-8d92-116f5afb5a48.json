["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The Nernst equation is used to calculate the equilibrium potential for a given ion. The equation is: E = RT/zF * ln([I]o / [I]i), where E is the equilibrium potential, R is the gas constant, T is the temperature in Kelvin, z is the charge of the ion, F is the Faraday constant, and [I]o and [I]i are the concentrations of the ion outside and inside the cell respectively. In this case, we have a negative ion with an extracellular concentration of 100 mMoL/L and an intracellular concentration of 10 mMoL/L. Plugging in these values, we get: E = RT/zF * ln(100/10). Using the given values for R, T, z, and F, we can solve for E.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
