["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the type of suturing technique used. None of the provided documents mention 'Figure of 8' or 'Direct loop'. The running vertical mattress suturing technique is described in one of the documents, but it's not the main focus. Therefore, we can eliminate options A and B. Horizontal mattress is mentioned as a method that provides excellent apposition of wound edges, which is similar to the description of the running vertical mattress suturing technique. Vertical mattress is also mentioned as equivalent to the simple vertical mattress technique. Since the question only asks about one type of suturing technique, we can conclude that it's either horizontal or vertical.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
