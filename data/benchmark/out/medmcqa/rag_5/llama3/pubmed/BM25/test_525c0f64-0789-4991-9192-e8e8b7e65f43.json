["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks to predict what good contacts in primary teeth with lack of spacing suggests about the future. In 'Occlusion in the primary dentition in 3-year-old children', it is mentioned that approximately one-half recorded neutral occlusion at both sides, and one-third had distal occlusion at both sides. The text does not provide a direct link between good contacts in primary teeth with lack of spacing and the question's options. However, we can infer that good contacts in primary teeth with lack of spacing might suggest normal occlusion or neutral occlusion in permanent teeth.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
