["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Since the question is asking about a disease caused by Staphylococcus aureus that is not mediated through a toxin, I will focus on the documents provided. According to the 'A gentamycin resistance plasmid in Staphylococcus aureus' document, drug resistance in S. aureus is frequently mediated by non-chromosomal DNA molecules referred to as R plasmids. Resistance to gentamycin has not been reported in a recent survey by Lacey [7]. In this paper, we describe a strain of S. aureus resistant to gentamycin-kanamycin-tobramycin-sisomycin, and experiments which suggest that the genetic determinant of these resistance characters is plasmid borne.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
