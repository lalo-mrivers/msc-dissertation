["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for the diagnostic method that does NOT diagnose CSF leakage. From the given documents, we can see that Î² 2-transferrin level is used to detect CSF leakage (Immunofixation to quantify beta 2-transferrin in cerebrospinal fluid to detect leakage of cerebrospinal fluid from skull injury). Tram line, increase in glucose, and increase in proteins are not mentioned as diagnostic methods for CSF leakage.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
