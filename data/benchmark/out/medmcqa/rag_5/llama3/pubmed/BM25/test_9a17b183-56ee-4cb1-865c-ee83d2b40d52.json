["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question mentions weakness, fatigue & hypoglycemia after consuming raw eggs. The patient was given vitamin tablets by the doctor, which suggests that the doctor is trying to treat a condition related to vitamin deficiencies. Since the patient presented with hypoglycemia, we need to look for a cause that relates to glucose metabolism. The relevant documents mention insulinomas and other causes of fasting hypoglycemia, but they do not provide information about enzyme deficiencies causing hypoglycemia after consuming raw eggs.\n\nThe document on Hypoglycemia in hypopituitary children suggests that inadequate adrenergic response or deficiency of gluconeogenic substrate may be a factor in the development of hypoglycemia. However, this does not seem to be related to the patient's condition.\n\nThe document on Depression and chronic fatigue in children mentions major depression disease being uncommon in children, but it does not provide information about enzyme deficiencies causing hypoglycemia.\n\nThe documents on Inadequate adrenergic response to disopyramide-induced hypoglycemia and Reliability of Arrhenius Equation in predicting vitamin A stability in multivitamin tablets do not seem to be relevant to the patient's condition.\n\nAfter carefully considering all the available information, we need to look at the patient's symptoms and treatment. The patient presented with weakness, fatigue & hypoglycemia after consuming raw eggs, and was given vitamin tablets by the doctor. This suggests that the doctor is trying to treat a condition related to vitamin deficiencies.\n\nOne possible explanation for this scenario could be a deficiency in an enzyme involved in glucose metabolism. The document on The diagnosis of insulinomas and other causes of fasting hypoglycemia does not provide information about specific enzyme deficiencies causing hypoglycemia, but it suggests that certain enzymes may be involved in the regulation of glucose metabolism.\n\nThe relevant documents do not provide a direct answer to the question, but they suggest that a deficiency in an enzyme involved in glucose metabolism could be a possible explanation for the patient's symptoms and treatment. Based on this reasoning, we can consider the possible choices provided.\", \n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
