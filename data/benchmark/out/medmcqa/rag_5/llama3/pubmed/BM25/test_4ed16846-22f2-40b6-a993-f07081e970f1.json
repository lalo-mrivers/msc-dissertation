The key point is that vertical increments of the anterior face can differ from those at the posterior face, leading to mandibular rotations. This growth is accompanied by dental compensations that tend to mask the rotation.

The teeth tend to move and grow in the opposite direction of the growth disproportionality.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
