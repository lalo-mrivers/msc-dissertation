["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks which of the given statements is not true. I will analyze each option: A) Parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTH-rP) is responsible for causing hypercalcemia in cancer patients. This statement is supported by multiple studies, so it's likely to be true. B) The unionized fraction of calcium in the plasma is an important determinant of PTH secretion. This statement is also supported by research and seems to be true. C) Mg2+ influences PTH secretion in the same direction as Ca2+, but is a less potent secretagogue. Magnesium has been shown to have both stimulatory and inhibitory effects on PTH, depending on the context, so this statement might not be entirely accurate. D) Ca2+ influences PTH secretion by acting on a calcium sensor G-protein coupled receptor located in the parathyroid gland. This is also supported by research and appears to be true.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
