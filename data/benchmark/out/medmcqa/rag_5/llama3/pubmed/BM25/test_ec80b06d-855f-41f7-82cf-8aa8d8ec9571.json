["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about Group 2 sensory fibres. Based on the provided documents, we can see that Group 2 sensory fibres are unmyelinated axons with somatic receptive fields in the skin and deep tissues (Sensory fibres in ventral roots L7 and S1 in the cat). This type of fibre is a mechanical nociceptor, which means it is sensitive to touch and pain. Therefore, Group 2 sensory fibres are attached to flower spray endings.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
