["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, there is no direct mention of any antidote for fibrinolytic therapy. However, I can identify some relevant information that might help answer this question. Fibrinolytic therapy typically involves the use of thrombolytic agents like streptokinase or tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA). These agents work by activating plasmin, which breaks down blood clots. Therefore, an antidote for fibrinolytic therapy would likely need to counteract the effects of these thrombolytic agents. After reviewing the documents, I found that physostigmine is used as an antidote to organophosphorous poisoning and can also be used experimentally to treat Alzheimer's disease. However, there is no direct evidence linking physostigmine to fibrinolytic therapy. Nevertheless, I will explore some of the other options to see if any of them might be relevant.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
