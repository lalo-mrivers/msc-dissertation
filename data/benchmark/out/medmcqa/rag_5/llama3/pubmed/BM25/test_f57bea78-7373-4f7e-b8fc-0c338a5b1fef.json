["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the instrument with a primary cutting edge being perpendicular to the blade. The relevant information comes from the [Defined contusion marks caused by the knife handle] document, which discusses stab wounds and the shape of the instrument used. Specifically, it talks about the position of the handle in relation to the wound. Since we are looking for the case where the instrument with primary cutting edge is perpendicular to the blade, we need to find a scenario that matches this condition. The document mentions that if the knife is vigorously pushed in up to the end of the blade, this does not only cause cutting of the tissue but also blunt traumatization. This implies that the blade is inserted perpendicularly into the tissue. Therefore, our answer should match this scenario.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
