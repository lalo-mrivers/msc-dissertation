["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about sudden death in a patient with an acute myocardial infarction. The provided documents discuss various causes of sudden death, including cardiac-related causes such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and sudden infant death syndrome. However, none of the discussed conditions specifically mention acute myocardial infarction. Therefore, we need to look beyond these specific conditions for a possible answer.

Therefore, it seems likely that sudden death in a patient with an acute myocardial infarction is most commonly due to ventricular fibrillation.\", \"answer_choice\": D}"]
