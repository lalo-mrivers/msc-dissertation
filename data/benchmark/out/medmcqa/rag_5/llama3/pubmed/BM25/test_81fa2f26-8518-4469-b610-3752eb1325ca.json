["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The given question is about cobalt chromium crown reconstruction. The temperature of soldering torch suddenly increases. Cobalt and Chromium are both mentioned in the development of a new investment for high-frequency induction soldering. Specifically, it mentions that among metal powders such as Fe, Ni, Co, the addition of 10 mass% cobalt powder was most effective. This indicates that cobalt is involved in the process.\n\nFrom the determination of chromium and cobalt in human serum by neutron activation analysis, we can see that chromium has a value of 0.160 +/- 0.083 mug/liter and cobalt has a value of 0.108 +/- 0.060 mug/liter. This indicates that chromium and cobalt are both present in the process.\n\nHowever, considering the changes in temperature during soldering, it is more relevant to focus on the development of a new investment for high-frequency induction soldering. The study mentions that among the three powders, the addition of 10 mass% cobalt powder was most effective. This indicates that cobalt plays an important role in this process.\n\nConsidering the properties mentioned, we can conclude that if the temperature of the soldering torch suddenly increases during cobalt chromium crown reconstruction, the yield strength will increase and percent elongation will decrease.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
