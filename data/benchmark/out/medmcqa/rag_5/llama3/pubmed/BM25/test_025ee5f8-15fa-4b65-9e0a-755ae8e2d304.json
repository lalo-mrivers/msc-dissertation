["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the provided documents, we can identify molecules with permanent dipoles. In 'Barrier to rotation and conformation of the -NR2 group in cytosine and its derivatives. Part II. Experimental and theoretical dipole moments of methylated cytosines.', it is mentioned that the dipole moment of 1,5,7-trimethylcytosine was considered as a model compound which closely reproduces the dipole moment of cytosine. This implies that cytosine has a permanent dipole. Similarly, in 'The electric dipole moment of rhodopsin solubilized in Triton X-100.', it is stated that the dipole moment of rhodopsin at its isoionic point was 720 D (150 charge-A). This suggests that rhodopsin has a permanent dipole. However, none of the other options mention molecules with permanent dipoles.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: Water\""]
