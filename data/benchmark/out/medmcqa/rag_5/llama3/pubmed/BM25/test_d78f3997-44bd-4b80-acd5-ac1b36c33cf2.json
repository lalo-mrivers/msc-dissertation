["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, I found that none of them specifically mention fixation period for intrusive luxation injuries. However, one document ([Isolated luxation of the trapezium bone]) mentions a patient's recovery without complications after covered reduction and percutaneous wiring. Another document (Traumatic globe luxation) discusses reposition in the emergency room followed by surgical exploration, but does not mention fixation period either. Therefore, I will rely on general knowledge to answer this question. According to various medical sources, the standard fixation period for luxation injuries is usually 4-6 weeks.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
