["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the application of force on the lateral surface at an angle region. The relevant documents are the ones related to compression forces. In the first document, it discusses the art of retaining lower overlay denture in relation to abutment tooth mobility while a force is applied to the denture. It mentions that when a force is applied indirectly to the abutment tooth, the lateral excursion changes greatly according to the retainer selected. The clasp retainer shows the greatest change in lateral excursion against every loading on the denture. This suggests that forces applied at an angle region can cause compression on different surfaces depending on the type of retainer used.\n\nIn the second document, it discusses mammographic unit compression force and acceptance test and quality control protocols. It emphasizes the importance of having a manual mode and a variable-force automatic mode to ensure reproducibility of compression-force levels.\n\nIn the third document, it discusses injuries of the midtarsal joint. It classifies the injuries according to the direction of the deforming force: medial, longitudinal compression, lateral, plantar, and crush types are described. This suggests that forces can cause different types of compression depending on the direction of the force.\n\nIn the fourth document, it discusses the pneumatonograph and its limitations in measuring intraocular pressure due to the compression of the scale by the weight of the plunger and gas propulsion force.\n\nBased on these documents, when force is applied on the lateral surface at an angle region, compression is generated on...\",\n\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
