["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents discuss various cases of oculomotor nerve palsy. One report discusses MRI findings in 3 cases of small midbrain infarct causing oculomotor nerve palsy. The anatomical location of the nucleus and nerves is described, which suggests that intrafascicular location of nerve fibers associated with pupil reaction is rostral. Another report discusses the reversal of oculomotor disorders after intracranial aneurysm surgery. It states that recovery starting within the first month will probably be complete for conduction block (neuroapraxia) or minor axonal changes (axonolysis). No other reports discuss pupil dilation, ptosis, or outward upward rolling of pupil in relation to 3rd nerve palsy. Therefore, it is likely that these conditions are not discussed.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
