["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant document for this question is 'Human muscle afferent responses to tendon taps'. It discusses the characteristics of the waveform recorded with transcutaneous electrodes. The study found that responses of muscle afferent nerve fibers to tendon taps can be recorded with surface electrodes attached to the skin over the nerve at the wrist. A considerable improvement in signal amplitude is achieved using differential amplification techniques, and the contribution to the afferent response from receptors other than in the muscle have been shown to be minimal. The characteristics of the afferent waveform (latency and duration) are discussed in relation to the applied stimulus. The contribution to the afferent response from primary muscle spindle endings is thought to be the major contributors to the afferent waveforms recorded by this technique.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
