["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to the theoretical analysis of Fick's equation, it is stated that Fick's Principle was derived theoretically by Fick in 1870. The principle deals with the internal relation between Fick's first law of diffusion and the general law of solution. By analyzing the diffusion of a substance into a streaming fluid according to the first diffusion law, perfectly isomorphic equations to Fick's Principle (No. 7 and No. 9) are obtained by what Fick's formula as a determinant of the heart-minute-volume is just proved to be derivable from Fick's first diffusion law.\",\n\"answer_choice\": A\n}"]
