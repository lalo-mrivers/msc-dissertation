["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about malaria relapse. The provided documents are about myxomycete plasmodium, Physarum polycephalum, and plasmodium actin. There is no direct information about human malaria species. However, we can focus on the properties of the antibody induced against purified actin from myxomycete plasmodium. The antibody reacted with plasmodium F- and G-actin, but not with actin from rabbit striated muscle. This suggests that the antibody is specific to certain species of plasmodia. Since there are no other relevant information about human malaria species, we can assume that the same properties apply to human Plasmodium species.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
