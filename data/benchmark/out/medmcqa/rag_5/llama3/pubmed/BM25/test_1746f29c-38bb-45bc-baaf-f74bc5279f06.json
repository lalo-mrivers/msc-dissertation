["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the development of primary teeth, including primary molars. According to 'Histological study on the postnatal development and sequence of eruption of the maxillary cheek-teeth of rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus)' , the deciduous molars are completely developed at birth, root resorption starting at 4 days. Since this refers to rabbit primary molars, it's not directly applicable to human primary molars. However, we can infer that human primary molars are also present at birth.\n\nThe same document states that permanent molar eruption begins at 9 days postnatally. This suggests that the development of primary teeth is already underway at birth.\n\nIn 'Caries susceptibility of first permanent molars and treatment needs in Sri Lankan children, aged 13-16 years, in 1986', it's mentioned that 'the caries status of the permanent first molar was studied in 683 school children (aged 13-16 years) selected from six schools in Kandy.' This does not provide information on when primary molars begin to calcify.\n\nIn 'Comparison of Gluma bond strength to primary vs. permanent teeth', it's mentioned that 'The purpose of this study was to measure the shear bond strength of Gluma/Lumifor (Gluma and Lumifor--Columbus Dental, St. Louis, MO) to the occlusal dentin of primary first and second molars, permanent first and second molars and premolars.' This document does not provide information on when primary molars begin to calcify.\n\nIn 'Long term retention of sealants applied by inexperienced operators in Minneapolis', it's mentioned that 'A clinical trial of 4047 single applications of Nuva Seal placed on the occlusal surfaces of primary molars, permanent first and second molars and premolars by 250 dental students showed that the sealants were not well retained.' This document does not provide information on when primary molars begin to calcify.\n\nIn 'Ankylosis of primary molars--a future periodontal threat to the first permanent molars?', it's mentioned that 'The material consisted of 143 permanent molars adjacent to 119 infra-occluded primary molars and 24 normal contralateral primary molars in 68 individuals.' This document does not provide information on when primary molars begin to calcify.\n\nBased on this analysis, the best answer is...\", \"answer_choice\": B}"]
