["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the provided documents, we can see that ketogenic amino acids increase during cardiopulmonary bypass in open-heart surgery. Additionally, glucogenic amino acids have been shown to be involved in the control of threonine catabolism and gluconeogenesis. Considering the characteristics of glycine as a glucogenic amino acid, it is unlikely to be a ketogenic amino acid. Moreover, the document on the effect of birth asphyxia on plasma free amino acids in preterm newborn infants shows that potentially glucogenic amino acids are elevated in response to lactic acidosis. This suggests that glycine may not be a good candidate for being both ketogenic and glucogenic. Therefore, we can rule out options D: Glycine, A: Isoleucine, B: Leucine, and C: Arginine as they do not fit the description of being both ketogenic and glucogenic amino acids.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
