["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about factors governing dentine permeability. From the provided documents, we know that different acid treatments can remove the smear layer and increase dentine permeability. Also, potassium oxalate and calcium hydroxide reduce dentine permeability. Additionally, storage solution and time have statistically significant effects on dentine permeability. However, none of these factors are directly related to all factors governing dentine permeability except one option.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
