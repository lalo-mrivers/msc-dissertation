["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant document is 'Effect of filler content of light-cured composites on bond strength to bovine dentine'. The question is asking for the volume percentage of filler in a dental composite with 75% by weight filler. In this document, it is mentioned that the experimental light-cured composite systems had filler contents ranging from 45% to 75% by volume. Since we are looking for the volume percentage corresponding to 75% by weight, we can extrapolate from the given data.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
