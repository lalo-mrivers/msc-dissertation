["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about extraction of a tooth during acute infection. We need to analyze the given documents for any relevant information. One case report mentions extraction of a tooth followed by Ludwig's angina, which is an aggressive infectious process that can spread quickly and be fatal if not recognized early.
