["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the intelligence quotient (IQ) classification based on a score of 90-110. We need to look at the provided documents for any information related to IQ scores or classifications. The document 'Antenatal exposure to doxylamine succinate and dicyclomine hydrochloride (Benedectin)' mentions that intelligence quotient scores were measured at four years of age in 28,358 children. However, it does not provide specific information about the classification or score ranges. The document '[The Dutch Reading Test for Adults: a measure of premorbid intelligence level]' discusses the National Adult Reading Test (NART) and the Dutch Adult Reading Test (DART), which are both used to predict premorbid intelligence. It mentions that the test is sensitive to cerebral deterioration in brain-damaged patients, but does not provide information about IQ classifications or score ranges. The document '[A study of dental status and its contributing factors in mentally retarded persons institutionalized in welfare facilities]' does not mention IQ scores or classifications at all.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that the provided documents do not contain specific information about IQ classifications or score ranges. However, we can look at general IQ classification categories to determine which category a score of 90-110 would fall into.\n\nIn general, IQ scores are classified as:\n\n* Mentally Retarded: below 70\n* Low Average: 71-84\n* Average: 85-114\n* Superior: 115-134\n* Profoundly Gifted: 135+\n\nBased on this classification system, a score of 90-110 would fall into the 'Average' category.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
