["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the worst prognosis for a heart patient during pregnancy. There are no specific documents provided that directly address this topic. However, we can look at some general information on peripartum cardiomyopathy (PPCM) and subarachnoid hemorrhage secondary to ruptured cerebral aneurysm in pregnancy. According to the document 'Peripartum cardiomyopathy: a case report', PPCM is a relatively rare form of acute heart failure that can worsen during late pregnancy or up to 5 months postpartum. This suggests that cardiac problems can be challenging during pregnancy. On the other hand, 'Subarachnoid hemorrhage secondary to ruptured cerebral aneurysm in pregnancy' reports on eight patients who suffered from ruptured cerebral aneurysms during pregnancy and all of them survived with good prognosis for both mother and fetus. This suggests that subarachnoid hemorrhage may not be a major concern during pregnancy. Considering the above information, it seems that cardiac problems, specifically PPCM, could be a significant issue during pregnancy.\",\n\"answer_choice\": A"]
