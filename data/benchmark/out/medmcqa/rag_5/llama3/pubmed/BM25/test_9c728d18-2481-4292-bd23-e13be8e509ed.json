["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents provide information on vertebral column abnormalities, but none of them specifically mention the total number of vertebrae present. However, we can refer to general anatomical knowledge. The human spine typically consists of 33 vertebrae: 7 cervical vertebrae, 12 thoracic vertebrae, and 5 lumbar vertebrae, plus the sacrum (5 fused vertebrae) and coccyx (4 fused vertebrae). Therefore, we can infer that the total number of vertebrae present in the vertebral column is between 33 and 52.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
