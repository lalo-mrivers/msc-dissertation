["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents discuss dental alloys and their properties. Type III gold alloy is mentioned as a reference point in some studies. There is no information about its hardness compared to type IV, nor its usage for small inlays. However, it is mentioned that Type III gold and Forticast (a nickel-chromium alloy) tied and were ranked first in terms of casting fit. This suggests that Type III gold alloy is not easily burnishable because Forticast, which has a different composition, was also ranked high. Finally, there is no information about the amount of gold in Type III compared to type IV.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
