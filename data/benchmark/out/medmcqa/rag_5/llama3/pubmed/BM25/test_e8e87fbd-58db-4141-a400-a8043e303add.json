["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the conditions where complete obliteration of pulp is NOT seen. From the provided documents, we know that pulp obliteration can occur due to trauma, systemic diseases, or dental anomalies such as dentinogenesis imperfecta and dentinal dysplasia.
