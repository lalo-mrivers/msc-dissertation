["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the best way to retain an orthodontically treated midline diastema. The relevant documents discuss the importance of maintaining a midline diastema and the potential for relapse. A study on the relationship between a clinically 'abnormal'-appearing maxillary midline frenum and a midline diastema shows that some patients may have a diastema without an abnormal frenum, while others may have an abnormal frenum without a diastema. This suggests that the presence of an abnormal frenum can affect the stability of the treated diastema. The documents also discuss surgical closure of diastemas and the importance of analyzing individual cases to determine whether the diastema will close through normal development or persist. Based on this information, it seems that a bonded lingual retainer may be the best option for retaining an orthodontically treated midline diastema.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
