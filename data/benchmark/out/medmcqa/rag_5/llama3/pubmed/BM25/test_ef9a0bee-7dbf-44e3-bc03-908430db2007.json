["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"After analyzing the provided documents, it seems that we can find information about radiation doses in intraoral radiography. We can look at [Dose and image quality in intraoral radiography] for specific data on patient skin doses. The study mentioned a mean value of the entrance skin dose was 6.5 mGy with a dose interval of 0.7-57 mGy, normalized to speed class D film. Additionally, it is stated that films are frequently processed until the desired density is obtained by visual estimation, which can lead to variations in doses.\n\nLooking at [Leaded shields for thyroid dose reduction in intraoral dental radiography], we see that exposure levels were measured with thermoluminescent dosimeters on three groups of 20 patients undergoing complete mouth surveys. Without a shield, the skin entrance dose to the thyroid was 20 mR per complete mouth survey. With the experimental shield, it was 12 mR and with the commercial shield, it was 9 mR.\n\nFinally, we can look at [Image intensifiers in Osteosynthesis a danger for the team? (author's transl)], which discusses X-ray load when working with image intensifiers. The tolerance basis is mentioned as 100 mrem per week.\n\nFrom this information, we can conclude that the maximum recommended dose for dental X-ray operator in a week is not directly stated, but we can make an educated estimate based on the provided data.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A: 100 milliroentgen\""]
