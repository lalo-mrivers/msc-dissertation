["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents suggest that sodium bicarbonate when given with local anaesthetics increases the pH and PCO2 of the mixture. This hastens the onset of epidural analgesia. The study examining changes in pH and PCO2 of three local anaesthetics reported to have a faster onset of analgesia following mixture with sodium bicarbonate shows that the pH and PCO2 increased following alkalinization but gradually decreased in all containers except in polypropylene syringes. Therefore, the correct answer is A: Increases speed and quality of anaesthesia.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
