["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents provide information about the visual system, but they don't directly discuss anticonvulsants causing contraction of the visual field.

This suggests that these drugs might affect the visual cortex or the visual field. Vigabatrin is not mentioned at all.\n\nThe other option, Levetiracetam, is not present in any of the provided documents. Ethosuximide is also not discussed.
