["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents discuss the chemical reactions involved in penicillin allergy. The first document explains that penicillins react with amino groups of proteins to cause an allergic reaction. This suggests that penicillin acts as a hapten, which is a small molecule that becomes attached to a protein and triggers an immune response. The second document presents data on the skin sensitivity and reagin levels in patients with penicillin allergy. It shows that most patients have positive reactions to penicilloyl structures, suggesting that these structures are important in triggering the allergic response. This also supports the idea that penicillin acts as a hapten, since it is reacting with amino groups of proteins to cause an immune response.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
