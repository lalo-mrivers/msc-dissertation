["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about a radiotherapist prescribing a new drug combination of chemotherapy and immunotherapy for metastatic melanoma. The treatment prolongs the survival. We need to analyze the information provided in the documents. In the document 'BCG immunotherapy as a systemic adjunct to surgery in malignant melanoma', it is mentioned that BCG systemic adjuvant immunotherapy may be effective for improving both the recurrence and survival rates in patients with regional metastases from malignant melanoma. This implies that the treatment prolongs the survival. Also, in the document 'Response of disseminated breast cancer to combined modality treatment with chemotherapy and levamisole with or without Bacillus Calmette-Gu√©rin', it is mentioned that combination immunotherapy with BCG and LMS did not seem superior to LMS alone in this study. This implies that the treatment prolongs the survival but does not necessarily reduce the incidence. Therefore, we can conclude that the incidence remains the same and prevalence increases.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
