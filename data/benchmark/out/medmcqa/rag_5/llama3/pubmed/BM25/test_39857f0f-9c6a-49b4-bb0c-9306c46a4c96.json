["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about tongue thrusting. There are no relevant documents provided that specifically discuss tongue thrusting or its features. However, we can try to relate the information to the anatomy and histology of the tongue. The anatomical observations on the tongue of 60 mm embryo of opossum describe the structure of the tongue, including the filiform papillae, fungiform papillae, circumvallate papillae, mucous glands, and nerve supply. This information does not provide any direct clues about tongue thrusting.\n\nThe only relevant document that might be indirectly related to tongue thrusting is 'Effect of tongue reduction on the orthodontic and surgical treatment of dysgnathia'. However, this paper discusses the reduction of tongue size in connection with orthodontic and surgical correction of prognathic anomalies of the jaws, rather than tongue thrusting itself.\n\nTherefore, we can't conclude anything about tongue thrusting based on these documents. The answer choice that is not seen in tongue thrusting would be a feature that is specific to the anatomy or histology of the tongue, which is not provided in any of the documents.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
