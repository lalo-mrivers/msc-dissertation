["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the percentage of lost radio-resistant cells in the retina. The relevant documents mention pigmented epithelium of the retina, which is resistant to radiation. According to one document, binuclear tetraploid cells are formed in the pigmented epithelium of the retina as a result of incomplete mitosis. This suggests that there may be cell loss or death in this layer. Additionally, another document discusses the formation of binuclear cells with a pigmented epithelium of the retina and rat liver. The study investigated the method of autoradiography using H3-thymidine to determine the duration of the phases of the mitotic cycle of cells of the pigmented epithelium of the rat retina. This further supports the idea that there may be cell loss or death in this layer.\n\nTherefore, based on the provided information, it is likely that the percentage of lost radio-resistant cells in the retina refers to the retinal pigment epithelium.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
