["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the provided documents, we can see that cephalometric analysis is used to evaluate growth changes. We also know that cephalometric roentgenography for nonhuman primates utilizes a surgically implanted head positioner to permit precise positioning of the head in all three planes of space. This method has been used in 36 animals, and at 35 months postsurgery the implants have remained stable and tissue compatibility is generally excellent. Roentgenograms obtained with this technique offer a high degree of accuracy in documenting growth changes and response to orthodontic treatment. Therefore, we can infer that cephalometric analysis is used to superimpose roentgenograms on the Sella-Nasion plane.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
