["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the rate of dentinal fluid permeability. The provided documents discuss the permeability of articular cartilage under compressive strain, the influx of urea during bronchoalveolar lavage, and the extracellular fluid movement in the pulp; however, they do not explicitly mention temperature variation, pressure gradient across dentinal tubule, increase viscosity of dentinal fluid, or rate of removal of substances by blood vessels as factors affecting dentinal fluid permeability. Therefore, the correct answer is A: Temperature variation.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
