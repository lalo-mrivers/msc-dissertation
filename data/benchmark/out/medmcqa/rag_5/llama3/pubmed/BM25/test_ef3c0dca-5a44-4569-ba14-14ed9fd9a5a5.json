["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the method of glucose transport in the intestine. From the provided documents, it can be seen that the small intestine plays a crucial role in carbohydrate metabolism, and glucose appears in the intestinal juice within 2-3 hours after carbohydrate uptake. The liver glucose transporter is also mentioned, which is expressed predominantly in liver, intestine, kidney, and pancreatic islet beta-cells. Additionally, there are inhibitory effects of phlorizin on sugar transport. Considering these points, it can be inferred that glucose transport in the intestine involves active mechanisms rather than simple diffusion.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
