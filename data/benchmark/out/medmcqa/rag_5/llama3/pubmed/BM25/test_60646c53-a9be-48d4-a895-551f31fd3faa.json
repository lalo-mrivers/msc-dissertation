["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant document is 'Impact trauma of the human temporal bone.' This study describes different types of fractures that can occur on the temporal bone after impact. It mentions that frontal and parietal impacts can produce ipsilateral and contralateral fractures. The velocity of the impact varied between 18.1 and 25.0 mph. According to this document, lateral impact produces a longitudinal fracture with posterior fossa comminution, which is associated with disruption of middle ear structures and the cochlea. This information suggests that direct impact on the bone can produce a comminuted fracture.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
