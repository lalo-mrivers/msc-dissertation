["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 20-year-old female who presented with abdominal pain one week prior. The initial USG and clinical examination were normal. However, she re-presented with loss of vision, but the physical examination was still unremarkable. This raises suspicion that there may be an underlying organic issue rather than a psychological disorder. Upon reviewing the literature on pertechnetate 99mTc for abdominal scanning in localising an ileal duplication cyst: case report and review of the literature, I found that this patient's symptoms are similar to those reported in the study, where a patient presented with periumbilical postprandial pain and some melena. The pertechnetate 99mTc abdominal scan showed a very large and horn-shaped focus of high activity in the right flank, which was later found to be an ileal duplication cyst. Given that this patient's symptoms are similar, it is possible that she may have an underlying gastrointestinal issue that is not yet apparent.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
