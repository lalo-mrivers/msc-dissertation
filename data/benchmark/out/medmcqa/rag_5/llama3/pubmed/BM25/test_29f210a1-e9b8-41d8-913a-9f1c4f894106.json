["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the characteristics of fly rhodopsin kinase, the structure and function of rhodopsin, and its role in phototransduction. Rhodopsin deficiency is a key aspect of retinitis pigmentosa, which is characterized by a loss of sensitivity in the retina. The study on kinetics of bleaching and regeneration of rhodopsin in abnormal (RCS) and normal albino rats suggests that RCS rats have a faster regeneration rate than normal rats, but their total rhodopsin density decreases with age. This information indicates that rhodopsin deficiency is not related to vitamin D deficiency or rickets.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
