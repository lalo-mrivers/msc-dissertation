["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about etching of dentin. We have multiple documents that discuss dentin bonding agents, the effect of fluorides on adhesion, molecular control of dentinogenesis, and etching of enamel prior to application of fissure sealants. The key point is that these documents all mention dentin in different contexts. Etching of dentin increases its surface energy, allowing for better bonding with restorative materials.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
