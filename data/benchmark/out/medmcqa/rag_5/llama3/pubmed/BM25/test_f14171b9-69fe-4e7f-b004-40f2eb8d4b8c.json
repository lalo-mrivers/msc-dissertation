["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks for G2 phase blockers. From the provided documents, we can identify DNA-ligands like netropsin, distamycin A, and berenil that cause impairment of the G2 phase of the cell cycle. These ligands bind to the minor groove of DNA, causing polyploidisation via prolongation of the G1 phase and arrest in the G2 compartment. We can conclude that these ligands are G2 phase blockers. Now, we need to find which options among A-D do not match this description.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
