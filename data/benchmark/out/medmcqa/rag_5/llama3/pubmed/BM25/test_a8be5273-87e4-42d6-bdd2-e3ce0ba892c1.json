["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about a true statement related to meningococcal vaccine. None of the options directly mention capsule polysaccharide as a virulent factor or conjugate vaccines given in outbreaks. Therefore, I will focus on the remaining options. Option C is incorrect because the provided documents suggest that vaccination status was confirmed by inspection of vaccination cards, and the study population consisted of children aged 3 months to 6 years. This implies that polysaccharide vaccine should not be given to children below 2 years of age. Option D is supported by the studies mentioned in the documents, which report on the protective efficacy of a serogroup B meningococcal vaccine.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
