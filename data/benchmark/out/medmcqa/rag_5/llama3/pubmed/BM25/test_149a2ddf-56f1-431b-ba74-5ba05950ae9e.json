["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about divergence from contact area in proximal surfaces causing embrasures. Upon reviewing the documents, we can see that there is no direct information related to embrasures or their causes. However, we can look at the anatomy of the ball of the foot as described in document 3. The plantar aponeurosis and internal architecture of the ball of the foot describe three transverse areas with different mechanical functions. This suggests that the area proximal to the heads of the metatarsals might be relevant to our question. Further analysis shows that this area is characterized by a series of transverse bands, which could potentially cause divergence from contact area in proximal surfaces.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
