["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"After reviewing the provided documents, we can see that vitamin K is involved in the posttranslational modification of certain serine protease zymogens which are critical components of the blood clotting cascade. We know from the document 'Severe deficiency of vitamin K dependent coagulation factors in an infant' that a severe deficiency of vitamin K dependent coagulation factors was observed, and we can infer that this is likely related to deficiencies in factor II, VII, or IX. Additionally, we have information on the role of vitamin K in prothrombin synthesis from the document 'Metabolism of vitamin K and prothrombin synthesis: anticoagulants and the vitamin K--epoxide cycle'. This suggests that factors II, VII, and IX are all vitamin K dependent.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
