["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"This question is related to the properties of gypsum-bonded investments. Since a thinner mix is mentioned, it's likely that we're talking about setting expansion or thermal expansion. We can look at documents for information on how mixing water affects the investment. In 'Ring volume/ring liner ratio and effective setting expansion', we see that a higher ring volume to ring liner ratio increases radial setting expansion. This suggests that a thinner mix of the investment (lower ring volume) would decrease setting expansion, which is option B.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
