["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents provided information about the muscles involved in mastication. The Muscles of Mastication in Small Children study mentioned that the temporalis, masseter, and depressor muscle group are responsible for various movements of the mandible. The Median-Ulnar Nerve Communications and Anomalous Innervation of the Intrinsic Hand Muscles study found a motor median-to-ulnar nerve anastomosis (Martin-Gruber anastomosis) in 32% of the cases, which mainly innervated muscles normally supplied by the ulnar nerve. This information does not directly relate to the supply of the muscles involved in mastication. The other studies did not provide relevant information about the supply of the muscles involved in mastication. Therefore, we need to look for a separate study that provides information about the blood vessels supplying these muscles.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
