["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks when sublingual tablet or GTN metered dose aerosol usually relieve angina. We can infer that the answer is related to the hemodynamic responses mentioned in the documents. Specifically, we can look at the document 'Comparative haemodynamic examination of Nitromint (sublingual tablet and aerosol)' which states that the drug action develops within a significantly shorter period with the aerosol compared to the sublingual tablet. This suggests that the answer is likely to be less than 10 minutes, as it takes around 5-7 minutes for the peak effect of the short infusion to occur according to the document 'Haemodynamic responses to glyceryl trinitrate: influence of rate and duration of delivery'.\", \"answer_choice\": C}"]
