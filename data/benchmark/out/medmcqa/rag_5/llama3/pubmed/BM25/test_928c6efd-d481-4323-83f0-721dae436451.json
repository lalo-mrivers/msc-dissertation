["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, cholinomimetic compounds are known to affect the respiratory system, circulatory control systems, and neuronal death. They can increase ventilation, raise arterial pressure, and have a role in the amelioration of delayed neuronal death. Cholinomimetics also interact with inorganic ions, such as calcium and potassium, which can reduce their teratogenic activity.\n\nIn terms of the question, we need to determine which of the options is not related to cholinomimetic compounds. Bradycardia (A) is actually a possible effect of high doses of acetylcholine, so it's not necessarily ruled out by the documents. Glaucoma (B) and myasthenia gravis (C) are both conditions that can be treated with cholinomimetics or affected by their use. Post-surgical atony or ileus (D), on the other hand, is a condition that is sometimes treated with cholinomimetics.\n\nTherefore, based on the available information, it seems most likely that post-surgical atony or ileus (D) is not directly related to cholinomimetic compounds.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
