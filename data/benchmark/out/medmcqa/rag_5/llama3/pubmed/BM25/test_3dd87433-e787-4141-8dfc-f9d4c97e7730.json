["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The apically repositioned flap procedure implies that the mucogingival junction (MGJ) is shifted into an apical location. The present study shows that there was no statistically significant difference in the orthopantomographic distance from the MGJ to the lower border of the mandible between ARF and GE operations, which indicates that the apically repositioned flap procedure does not result in a permanent apical shift of the MGJ. Additionally, the technique is recommended as an alternative to gingivectomy where possible.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D\n}"]
