["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe T cells and their interactions with other immune cells. The first document describes the properties of three I region associated immunoregulatory factors involved in cell interactions, including antigen specific T helper factor. The second document discusses aberrant T cell regulation of IgE production in atopy and shows that CD4+ allergen-specific T cells from atopic patients produce IL-4 but not IFN-gamma. The third document describes the T cell receptor as a multicomponent signalling machine, highlighting the roles of CD4/CD8 coreceptors and CD45. Finally, the fourth document discusses in vitro differences between the lymphocytes of normal subjects and atopics, including a relative deficiency of suppressor T cells in atopic diseases.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B\n}"]
