["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The provided documents describe various scenarios of bacteria presence. In the first document, it is mentioned that bacteria were commonly seen on the rim of epithelial cells, at the base of some ulcers, and within the cavities produced by the hooks of the larvae in Gasterophilus intestinalis lesions. Similarly, in the third document, bacteria were cultured from nephrectomy specimens and were also found to be present in macrophages.
