["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents suggest that the question is asking about first trimester screening for Down's syndrome. The documents provide information on maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), unconjugated estriol, and human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) levels in combination with maternal age as a method of prenatal screening for Down's syndrome. However, the question specifically asks about first trimester screening. There is no mention of any specific test or marker used in the first trimester for Down's syndrome screening. Therefore, it can be inferred that the answer choice A: Beta HCG and PAPP-A is the correct option as it refers to the first trimester markers.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
