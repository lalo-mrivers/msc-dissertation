["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the mechanism of adhesion of GIC restoration with tooth surface. GIC stands for glass-ionomer cement. The provided documents are about different topics such as bacterial adhesion to a tooth, bite-forming technique of occlusal composite restoration, general immunocompetence and tumour-directed, cell-mediated hypersensitivity in vitro in patients with renal carcinoma, cell surface protein partially restores morphology, adhesiveness, and contact inhibition of movement to transformed fibroblasts, and in vitro microleakage of Class V composite resin restorations with and without light-cured glass-ionomer cement lining. However, none of these documents explicitly mention the mechanism of adhesion of GIC restoration with tooth surface. Therefore, we need to rely on general knowledge about GIC. Glass ionomers are known to form an adhesive bond with tooth surfaces through a chelation mechanism, where the carboxyl and phosphate groups in the cement react with calcium and hydroxide ions present in saliva and tooth structure. This reaction forms a strong bond between the GIC and tooth surface.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B: Chelates with Metal Ions\""]
