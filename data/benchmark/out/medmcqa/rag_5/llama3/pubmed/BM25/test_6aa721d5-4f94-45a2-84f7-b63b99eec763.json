["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, it can be seen that desensitization is a phenomenon where the response to an agonist wanes in the continued presence of agonist. Desensitization was observed in various studies: the NMDA receptor-channel complex, the M-current in sympathetic neurons, GABA-induced currents in cultured rat hippocampal neurons, and the 5-HT3 receptor in a rat glioma x mouse neuroblastoma hybrid cell. Additionally, desensitization of cAMP-mediated pepsinogen secretion was observed in chief cells from guinea pig.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"None of the above\""]
