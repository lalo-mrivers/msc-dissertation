["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with instability of the knee joint in full extension without instability at 90 degrees of flexion. This suggests that the damage is likely to be in a structure that provides rotational stability rather than anterior-posterior stability. The fact that the patient does not have instability at 90 degrees of flexion suggests that the posterior cruciate ligament (C) is intact or damaged minimally, as it provides most of its stability at this angle.\n\nThe patient's symptoms are consistent with rotatory instability, which is often caused by damage to the posterolateral pa of the anterior cruciate ligament (A). This is supported by the fact that the patient has a history of playing hockey, which can cause rotational injuries to the knee joint.\n\nTherefore, based on the patient's symptoms and the likely mechanism of injury, it is most likely that the structure most commonly damaged is the posterolateral pa of the anterior cruciate ligament (A).\",\n\"answer_choice\": A"]
