["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The autonomic nervous system is a division of the nervous system that controls involuntary actions such as heart rate, blood pressure, digestion, and respiration. The relevant documents highlight the importance of the central nervous system in the functioning of the autonomic nervous system. Specifically, it can be seen from [Gastrointestinal motility and autonomic nerve dysfunction] that the autonomic nervous system (ANS) is influenced by both the enteric nervous system (ENS) and the central nervous system. Moreover, [The role of the central nervous system in chronic congestive heart failure] states that the central and autonomic (sympathetic) nervous systems are responsible for a large part of the clinical manifestations of chronic congestive heart failure. Therefore, it can be inferred that the centre of activity of the autonomic nervous system is located in the central nervous system.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
