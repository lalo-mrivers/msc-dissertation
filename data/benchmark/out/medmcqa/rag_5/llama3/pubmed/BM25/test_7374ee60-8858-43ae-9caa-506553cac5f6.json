["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the time required for pre-oxygenation before tracheal intubation. We don't have any information from the provided documents that directly answers this question. However, we can look at document 2, where fibreoptic intubation is described as a technique used to overcome respiratory obstruction while passing through an opening in a membrane. It mentions using pre-oxygenation and voluntary hyperventilation followed by breath-holding during bronchoscopy. This suggests that the time required for pre-oxygenation might be around 2-3 minutes, considering it's done before fibrescope passage.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
