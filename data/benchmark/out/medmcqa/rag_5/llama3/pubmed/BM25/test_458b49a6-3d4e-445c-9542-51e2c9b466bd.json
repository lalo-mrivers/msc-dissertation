["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the reflexes that appear at birth. We need to identify the reflexes mentioned in the provided documents and check if they are present at birth or not.\\nFrom the document 'Effects of genetic and nutritional factors on post-natal reflex and behavioral development in the mouse', we can see that the results indicate that early malnutrition delayed the development of the reflex and ECoG activities. This suggests that some reflexes may not appear until after birth.\\nLooking at the other documents, we have information about soleus muscle reflexes evoked by stimulation of the posterior tibial nerve compared to tendon reflexes in man, anorectal manometry in newborns, emerging characteristics of the acoustic reflex in infants, and appearance of substance P-like immunoreactive neurons in the rat superior colliculus after neonatal eye enucleation. These documents do not provide information about the specific reflexes mentioned in the question.\\nTherefore, we need to rely on general knowledge or other sources to determine if these reflexes appear at birth.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
