["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"There is no direct evidence of increased calcium in blood provided by the given documents. However, one study mentioned that calcium intake was estimated using questions regarding usual frequency of intake of foods high in calcium and of calcium-containing supplements and antacids. This suggests that calcium levels may be influenced by dietary factors. Another study discusses calcium binding to erythrocyte membrane, transport and binding in calcium uptake by microvillous membrane of human placenta, and electron microscopic study of striatodental calcification (Fahr). These studies do not provide direct evidence of increased calcium in blood either. A study on mineral balance and bone histology in spontaneously hypertensive rats mentions urinary potassium and calcium excretions were enhanced by added dietary NaCl and saline. This may indicate that calcium levels are influenced by diet, but it does not directly suggest an increase in calcium levels.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
