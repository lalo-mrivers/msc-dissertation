["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 2-month-old girl with failure to thrive, polyuria, and medullary nephrocalcinosis affecting both kidneys. The blood pH is high (7.48), bicarbonate is low (25 mEq/l), potassium is low (2 mEq/l), sodium is normal (126 mEq/l), and chloride is low (88 mEq/l). This suggests a diagnosis of metabolic alkalosis with hypokalemia. Distal renal tubular acidosis can also cause hypokalemia, but the high blood pH suggests that this is not the primary issue here. Primary hyperaldosteronism would likely show higher sodium levels, which are normal in this patient. Bartter syndrome is a rare disorder that can cause polyuria and electrolyte imbalances, but it typically presents earlier in life. Pseudohypoaldosteronism type II is characterized by hyperkalemia, which is not present here. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is distal renal tubular acidosis.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
