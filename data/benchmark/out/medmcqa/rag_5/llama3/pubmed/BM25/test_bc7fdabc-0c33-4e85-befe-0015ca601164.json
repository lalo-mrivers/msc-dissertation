["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the hormone that stimulates uterus contraction and lets down milk. We can find this information by reviewing the provided documents. Document 1 talks about insulin's effect on calcium washout from rat fat cells and muscles, but doesn't mention uterus or milk letdown. Document 2 discusses pharmacological reactivity in Cricetus auratus uterus, but it only mentions various spasmogen agents, not a hormone that stimulates contraction and lets down milk. Document 3 is about the mechanisms involved in the effects of phenidone, diclofenac, and ethacrynic acid on rat uterus, but again, doesn't mention a specific hormone for milk letdown. The only relevant document is [Effect of estrone on rat uterine contraction induced by prostaglandin (author's transl)]. It talks about the effect of estrone on rat uterine contraction and increase of internal pressure of uterus induced by prostaglandin, which suggests that estrone might be involved in milk letdown. However, it doesn't explicitly state that estrone lets down milk.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
