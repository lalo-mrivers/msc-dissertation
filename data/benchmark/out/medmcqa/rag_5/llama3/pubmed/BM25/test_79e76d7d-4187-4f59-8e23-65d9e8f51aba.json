However, it does not provide any information about 'Gjessing canine'. Finally, the document [Replantation of a maxillary canine tooth after traumatic avulsion in a dog] provides some context about 'canine' tooth, but it is not clear how this relates to Rolf Gjessing's work. Therefore, we need to analyze other documents. The paper [Biomathematical models of schizophrenia] does not provide any information about 'Gjessing canine'. The document [Effect of storage on measurement of ionized calcium and acid-base variables in equine, bovine, ovine, and canine venous blood] provides some context about 'canine' venous blood, but it is not clear how this relates to Rolf Gjessing's work.
