["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The recurrent laryngeal nerve is responsible for the innervation of the intrinsic abductors and adductors of the larynx. The muscles mentioned in the options are: Cricohyoid, Cricothyroid, Arytenoid, and Aryepiglotticus. After reviewing the relevant documents, it can be seen that Cricothyroid is a muscle supplied by the external branch of the superior laryngeal nerve (Selective laryngeal re-innervations in the dog by nervous microsutures of branches of the recurrent laryngeal nerve). Aryepiglotticus is not mentioned in the documents at all. The other options, Cricohyoid and Arytenoid are mentioned as being supplied by the recurrent laryngeal nerve (Selective laryngeal re-innervations in the dog by nervous microsutures of branches of the recurrent laryngeal nerve). Therefore, it can be concluded that the correct answer is D: Aryepiglotticus.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
