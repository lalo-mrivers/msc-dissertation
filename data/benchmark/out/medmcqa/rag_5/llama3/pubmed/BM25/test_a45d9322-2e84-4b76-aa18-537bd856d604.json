["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Ifosfamide is an alkylating agent, so it's not nitrogen mustard (A). We don't have information about its metabolism by CYP3A4 or the formation of active metabolites. The papers mention carboxy-Ifosfamide and two dechloroethylated compounds as stable alkylating metabolites, but no specific information about an active metabolite formed through CYP3A4. Chloracetaldehyde is mentioned as one of the dechloroethylated compounds, so option C is true. Lastly, the papers don't compare the neurotoxicity of Ifosfamide and cyclophosphamide directly, but they do mention that Ifosfamide has a disadvantageous toxicity spectrum compared to cyclophosphamide.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
