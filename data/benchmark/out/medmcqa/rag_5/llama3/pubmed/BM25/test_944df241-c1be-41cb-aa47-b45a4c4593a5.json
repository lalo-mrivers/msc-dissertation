["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant document that addresses ionic exchange between enamel surface and environment is 'Effect of fluoride on ion exchange, remineralization and acid resistance of surface enamel.' According to this document, the rates of F- exchange in enamel depend on the concentration of F- in solutions. This suggests that ionic exchange continues as long as there are changes in the concentration of ions in the environment.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: Continues through out life\""]
