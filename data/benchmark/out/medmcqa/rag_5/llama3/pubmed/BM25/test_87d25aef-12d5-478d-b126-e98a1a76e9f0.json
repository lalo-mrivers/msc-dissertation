["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents provide information about different stages of plasmodium vivax. The first document discusses the relationship between Duffy antigens and malaria, mentioning that Fya and Fyb antigens are related to the erythrocyte receptors for Plasmodium knowlesi. The second and third documents discuss Trypanosoma vivax, which is a different parasite from Plasmodium vivax. However, they do not provide information about the infective stage of Plasmodium vivax to mosquitoes. The fourth document discusses Physarum polycephalum, a myxomycete, and its relation to plasmodium formation, but it does not provide relevant information about Plasmodium vivax.
