["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the importance of CG islands in our DNA. From the given documents, it can be inferred that CpG islands are inherently resistant to de novo methylation. This is because DNA methyltransferase does not make base-specific contacts with residues that flank CpG sites and instead, local conformational features such as ease of strand separation, minor groove dimensions, and alternative secondary structures contribute to the resistance. Therefore, it can be concluded that CG islands are important for preventing de novo methylation.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
