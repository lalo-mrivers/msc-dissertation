["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the distal pole of scaphoid going to avascular necrosis after a scaphoid fracture. The reason given is that the blood supply of the scaphoid is from distal to proximal. This suggests that if the distal pole fractures, it may become avascular and necrotic due to disruption of its blood supply. The relevant documents describe scaphoid pseudarthrosis and nonunion, including the use of Russe's procedure with cancellous bone grafting. They also discuss the load-bearing characteristics of the scaphoid in the proximal carpal joint and the effects of simulated fractures on the scaphoid contact area and pressure. One document reports on the treatment of scaphoid nonunion with casting and pulsed electromagnetic fields, including a study continuation. Finally, another document describes ipsilateral fractures of the distal radius and scaphoid treated by Herbert screw and external skeletal fixation. These documents suggest that the blood supply of the scaphoid is from proximal to distal, not vice versa.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
