["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the function of the inferior oblique muscle. The relevant documents discuss various aspects of the superior oblique muscle and its relation to the inferior oblique muscle, but there is no direct information about the function of the inferior oblique muscle. However, one document discusses the measurement of inferior oblique muscle recession and its relation to the inferior rectus muscle insertion, which provides some context. Another document talks about the unexpected role of the oblique muscles in human vertical fusional reflex, which implies that both superior and inferior oblique muscles are involved. The third document is unrelated to the question.\n\nBased on this information, we can deduce that the inferior oblique muscle is responsible for downward rotation, as it is mentioned in the first document that myectomy of the inferior oblique muscle was followed by return of normal function to the superior oblique muscle, including upward rotation. This suggests that the inferior oblique muscle has a role in upward rotation.\n\nThe other options are not supported by the information provided: lateral rotation and extortion are not mentioned at all, and downward rotation is not explicitly stated as being the only function of the inferior oblique muscle.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
