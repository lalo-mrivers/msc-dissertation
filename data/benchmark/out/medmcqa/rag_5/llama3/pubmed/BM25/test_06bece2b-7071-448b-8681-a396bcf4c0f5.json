["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant document is 'Mould-reaction with gypsum bonded refractory investments'. According to this document, three series of standard tensile test specimens were produced using the nickel-base Ticonium Premium 100 alloy cast into a gypsum-bonded investment. The degree of investment breakdown resulting from mould reaction was assessed visually and by sulphur determination. Since phosphate bonded investment is mentioned in the first relevant document 'The influence of the refractory investment on the development of porosity in cast structures', but it does not provide information about carbon content, we should focus on the effects of mould reaction. The document indicates that the degree of investment breakdown was assessed visually and by sulphur determination. This suggests that there is no significant difference between phosphate bonded investment and other types of investments.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
