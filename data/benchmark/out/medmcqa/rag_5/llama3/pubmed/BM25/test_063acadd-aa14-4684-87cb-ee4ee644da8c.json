["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the case reports of testicular torsion in neonates, infants, and adults, it is essential to consider testicular torsion as a possible cause of severe scrotal pain. The reports emphasize the importance of prompt surgical intervention to prevent testicular infarction or necrosis. Since the boy's symptoms are worsening over time, immediate surgical intervention is necessary. Scrotal scanning can be useful in evaluating testicular perfusion and refining indications for operation, but it may not always detect torsion that has relieved itself before the scan was performed.\n\nIn this case, I would recommend a thorough examination of the scrotum to confirm the diagnosis of testicular torsion. Immediate surgical intervention is necessary to prevent further damage to the testis. Therefore, the correct answer is A: Immediate scrotal exploration of the affected side and operate opposite side if symptomatic.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
