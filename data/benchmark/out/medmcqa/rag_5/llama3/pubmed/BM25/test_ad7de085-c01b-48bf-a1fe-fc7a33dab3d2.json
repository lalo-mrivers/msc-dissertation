["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"There is no information about the investigation methods used to diagnose acute pyelonephritis in boys. However, we can look at the relevant documents for similar cases. In the first document, 'Treatment of acute pyelonephritis in women with intramuscular ceftriaxone: an out-patient study', standard bacteriologic methods were used to identify the pathogens and their susceptibilities before treatment and at intervals during and after treatment. This suggests that microbiological examinations like gram stain might be used. In the second document, 'Subdural interhemispheric empyema in a 7-year-old boy', there is no information about the investigation methods used for acute pyelonephritis. The third document, 'The quantitation of pregnancy specific beta 1-glycoprotein by enzyme linked immunoassay', is not relevant to this case. The fourth document, 'Xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis. A report of 2 cases', does not provide information about the investigation methods used for acute pyelonephritis either.\", \"answer_choice\": D}"]
