["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The provided documents do not directly mention the percentage of carbon in carbon steel hand instruments. However, we can look at the document 'Physical dimensions, torsional performance, and metallurgical properties of rotary endodontic instruments.' which discusses the physical properties of carbon steel Peeso drills. From this document, we can infer that carbon steel instruments are susceptible to brittle torsional fracture, whereas stainless steel instruments exhibit ductile torsional fracture.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D: 6 to 8%\"}"]
