["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the provided documents, we can see that the meniscal tissue is modeled as a fiber-reinforced, transversely isotropic material. In the context of this model, when force is applied perpendicular to the surface of the meniscus, it will cause tensile strain in the fibers. This is evident from the discussion on the importance of including a transversely isotropic, fibrous representation of the solid phase in the simulation. Additionally, the document on 'The medius gluteus with 1-legged stance' discusses the force exerted by the gluteus medius and its relationship to the angle formed by the cephalo-trochanteric line below and the iliac wing above the ilio-trochanteric angle. This suggests that forces applied perpendicular to the surface can cause tensile strain.\n\nFrom the document on 'Constitutive relation for red cell membrane', we see that the correct strain tensor representation is Lagrangian in nature, which implies that it measures finite deformations relative to the undeformed material state. This also supports the idea that forces applied perpendicular to the surface can cause tensile strain.\n\nFinally, from the document on 'The high rugby tackle--an avoidable cause of cervical spinal injury?', we see that the risk of trauma to the cervical spine caused by the force applied to the neck in a high tackle is discussed. This suggests that forces applied perpendicular to the surface can also cause tensile strain.\n\nIn conclusion, based on these three documents, it is evident that when force is applied perpendicular to the surface, it will cause tensile strain.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
