["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about a material that turns to liquid on applying critical shear stress. The provided documents discuss various types of flow, including viscoplastic flow, which involves two intrinsic material constants: yield shear and surface viscosity. Viscoplastic flow can be described as a type of flow where the material exhibits non-linear behavior at high shear rates. This is different from Newtonian bodies that exhibit linear behavior with respect to shear rate. The critical value mentioned in the document 'Changes in the microstructure of cultured porcine aortic endothelial cells' (ca. 900) can be related to the yield shear, which is the maximum shear resultant that the membrane can sustain before it begins to deform irreversibly.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
