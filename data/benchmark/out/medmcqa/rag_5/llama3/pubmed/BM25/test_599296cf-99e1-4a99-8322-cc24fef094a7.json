["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has received Anti-D at 28 weeks of pregnancy. Since she was given a single injection of Rh immune globulin (300 mug) at 28 weeks' gestation and subsequently was delivered of Rh-positive babies, it is likely that antenatal prophylaxis was successful in preventing Rh isoimmunization during pregnancy.
