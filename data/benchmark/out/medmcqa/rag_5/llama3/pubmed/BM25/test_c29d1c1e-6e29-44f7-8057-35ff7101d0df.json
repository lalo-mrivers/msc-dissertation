["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks which is responsible for adhesion of platelet on exposed collagen fibril after an injury. We can analyze the given documents to identify the key information related to this topic. One of the main findings is that platelets do not aggregate upon exposure to basement membranes or collagens derived therefrom. However, it is suggested that the end of the fibril which is embedded in the outer face of the basement membrane may be involved in interaction with the platelet. Furthermore, it is known that collagen age and platelet aggregation are related, but this does not directly answer the question. Finally, glycoprotein Ia/IIa-mediated activation-dependent platelet adhesion to collagen is mentioned as a mechanism.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: Fibronectin\"\n}"]
