["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the induction of an inhalational agent. Based on the given documents, we can see that Enflurane was found to be a satisfactory inhalational anaesthetic agent without serious adverse effects in children. However, the main point here is not about Enflurane but about the speed of induction. According to the study on Rapid Inhalational Induction (RII) with isoflurane or halothane, isoflurane produced a faster induction than halothane. Therefore, we can conclude that induction of an inhalational agent is faster when using isoflurane.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
