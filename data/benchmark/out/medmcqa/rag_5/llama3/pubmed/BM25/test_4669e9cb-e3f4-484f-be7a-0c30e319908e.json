["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the treatment of hypersensitive dentin in molars. According to the abstract on Neurophysiological mechanisms of dentin hypersensitivity, the sensitivity of dentin is caused by the activation of intradental A-type nerve fibres which are most probably activated by the hydrodynamic mechanism. This means that the condition of the dentinal tubules greatly affects dentin sensitivity. Since blocking of the tubules effectively prevents the nerve activation, it's likely that a caustic that can block or modify the tubules would be effective in treating hypersensitive dentin.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
