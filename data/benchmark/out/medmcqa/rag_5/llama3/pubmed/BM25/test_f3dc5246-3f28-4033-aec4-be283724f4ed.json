["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about how to expose the submandibular duct via an intraoral approach. We need to look for a relevant document that describes such a procedure. The documents provided are case reports and articles on various medical topics, but one of them might mention this specific technique. After reviewing the documents, we find that 'Removal of a medially attached, fractured condyle via an intraoral approach: report of case' is the most relevant article.
