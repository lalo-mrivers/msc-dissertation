["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant information is about the localization of Golgi apparatus in different types of cells. The Ultrastructural localization of endogenous mammary gland peroxidase during lactogenesis in the rat results after tannic acid-formaldehyde-glutaraldehyde fixation mentions that Diaminobenzidine cytochemical reaction product is present in perinuclear cisternae, in the granular endoplasmic reticulum and in Golgi apparatus of functionally differentiated secretory cells. The same information is also mentioned in the Fine structural localization of thiamine pyrophosphatase and acid phosphatase activities in the mouse pancreatic acinar cell. This suggests that the Golgi apparatus is present near the nucleus.\n\nThe Differential distribution of salivary agglutinin and amylase in the Golgi apparatus and secretory granules of human salivary gland acinar cells states that reactivity was found in the trans Golgi saccules, trans Golgi network, and immature and mature secretory granules. This suggests that the Golgi apparatus is present between the nucleus and the apical side.\n\nThe In vitro incorporation of (3H)threonine and (3H)glucose by the mucous and serous cells of the human bronchial submucosal gland. A quantitative electron microscope study. mentions that Tritiated threonine was first localized in the endoplasmic reticulum of both mucous and serous cells and later migrated to the Golgi apparatus, while metabolites of [3H]glucose localized first mainly in the Golgi apparatus. This suggests that the Golgi apparatus is present near the nucleus.\n\nAll these information suggest that the Golgi apparatus is located supranuclearly or adjacent to the nucleus.\",\n\"answer_choice\": A"]
