["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To find the range in which 95% of the population would be lying, we need to construct a confidence interval with a confidence level of 95%. The mean IOP is 25 mm Hg and the standard deviation (SD) is 10 mm Hg. We can use the formula: mean +/- (1.96 x SD), where 1.96 is the Z-score for a 95% confidence interval.\n\nFor 2.5th percentile: 25 - (1.96 x 10) = 5\nFor 97.5th percentile: 25 + (1.96 x 10) = 45\n\nSo, the range in which 95% of the population would be lying is from 5 to 45 mm Hg.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
