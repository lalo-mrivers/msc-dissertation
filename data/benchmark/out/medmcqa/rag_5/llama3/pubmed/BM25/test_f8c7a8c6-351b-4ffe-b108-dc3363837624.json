["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the validity and reliability of the new method of measuring Haemoglobin levels, we need to compare the results obtained from this method with those obtained from a standard calorimetry. The readings from the new method are scattered, but they all fall within a narrow range (9.1-12.1). This suggests that the method is reliable and can provide consistent results. However, it seems that there may be some bias in the measurements as the average reading from the new method (9.76) is lower than the standard calorimetry result (10.2). Therefore, the validity of the new method may be affected by this bias.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
