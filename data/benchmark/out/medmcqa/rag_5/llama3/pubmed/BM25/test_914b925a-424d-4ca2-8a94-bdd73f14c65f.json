["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking which option does not complicate into CHF. We need to analyze the relevant documents to find the answer. The main issue with CHF is cardiac failure, which is caused by antiarrhythmic drugs in some cases. Patients with a history of heart failure, low left ventricular ejection fraction, and cardiomyopathy are at increased risk of developing CHF with antiarrhythmic drugs. Digoxin can also worsen CHF in patients with chronic heart failure due to diastolic dysfunction.\n\nThe options provided are all related to congenital heart defects or conditions that may affect the cardiovascular system. However, none of these options specifically relate to CHF complication by digoxin or antiarrhythmic drugs.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that all options (A-D) complicate into CHF, and there is no option that does not.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
