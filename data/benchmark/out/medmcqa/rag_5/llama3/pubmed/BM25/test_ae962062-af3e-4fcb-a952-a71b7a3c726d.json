["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The study on posterior palatal seals with varying palatal forms suggests that the width of the posterior palatal seal area was compared with original models which were produced by plaster impressions. The analysis of maxillary complete denture and its underlying supporting tissues under vertical occlusal force in centric occlusion shows that pressure is exerted over most of the area of the jaw bone cortical surface and compression stress is strongly concentrated over the alveolar ridge. This indicates that increased depth in posterior palatal seal area can cause unseating of denture base.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
