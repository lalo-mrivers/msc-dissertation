["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, it is clear that the child has some developmental delays. The child can walk upstairs one step at a time, which indicates some motor skills are present. However, they cannot jump, which may suggest some coordination issues. Additionally, the child can speak sentences and tell their name and gender, indicating some linguistic abilities. However, they find it difficult to narrate a story, which might imply some cognitive or receptive language difficulties.\n\nConsidering these findings, I would look for clues in the documents that describe developmental milestones and potential pitfalls in developmental diagnosis. The document on 'Developmental dysphasia: clinical importance and underlying neurological causes' mentions different stages of development, including pre-verbal and early verbal stages. It also discusses motor pathology, receptive pathology, and language syndromes.\n\nIn the context of this child's abilities, I would focus on the description of 'pure dysphasia' without any other neurological signs. This might suggest a genetic or limited neuronal level developmental disorder, which could be contributing to their difficulties in narrating a story.\n\nTaking these factors into account, I would conclude that the child's actual developmental age is likely to be higher than 1 year old, considering they can already walk upstairs one step at a time and speak sentences. However, their difficulties in jumping and narrating a story might indicate some underlying developmental issues.\n\nBased on this analysis, I believe the correct answer is C: 3.\", \n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
