["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant document is 'Cloning hybridomas in a reversible three-dimensional alginate matrix'. According to this document, alginate gelation is calcium dependent and temperature independent. Since the question specifies 20 degrees, we can conclude that the time required for alginate to form a gel at 20 degrees is not affected by temperature.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A: 3-4 mins.\""]
