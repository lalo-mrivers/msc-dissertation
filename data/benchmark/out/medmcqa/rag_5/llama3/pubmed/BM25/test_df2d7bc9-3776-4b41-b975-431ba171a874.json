["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 7-year-old child with fever and tibial swelling. The X-ray shows periosteal reaction, which suggests the possibility of osteomyelitis or inflammatory process. Laboratory results show raised ESR (Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate) and TLC (Total Leucocyte Count), which further supports this suspicion. Considering these findings, I would focus on ruling out skeletal lesions such as child abuse syndrome, also known as battered child syndrome, which is characterized by osteoepiphyseolysis with fragmentation of the edges and periosteal calcifications. To confirm or rule out this possibility, total body bone scans should be performed to detect any lesions earlier and decrease radiation dose.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
