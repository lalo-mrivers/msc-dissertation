["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the given documents, it is clear that synthetic resins are used in dentistry. The document 'Mutagenic activity of epoxy embedding reagents employed in electron microscopy' mentions epoxy-based embedding media, which is a type of synthetic resin. Additionally, the document 'Preparation of protected peptide amides using the Fmoc chemical protocol' discusses the use of different resins for solid phase synthesis. In this context, plasticizers are substances added to improve the properties of the resin. The relevant document does not explicitly state the role of plasticizers in synthetic resins used in dentistry. However, based on general knowledge and understanding of plasticizers, we can infer that their primary function is to reduce polymerization shrinkage, which is an important consideration in dental applications where accuracy and precision are crucial.\", \"answer_choice\": D}"]
