["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"After reviewing the provided documents, I noticed that there is no direct information about the recommended daily intake of iodine in pregnancy. However, I did find some relevant information on iodine metabolism and requirements in adults and animals. According to the document 'The iodine requirement and influence of iodine intake on iodine metabolism and thyroid function in the adult beagle', the minimum daily iodine requirement of an adult beagle is 140 mug.\n\nFurthermore, according to the document 'Long-term turnover of thyroid iodine in the rat as studied by the isotopic equilibrium method', there is a very slow iodine pool present in the lysosomes (about 50% in each group) which is dependent on the daily iodine intake. This information might be relevant when considering the recommended daily intake of iodine in pregnancy.\n\nBased on this information, I will make an educated guess about the recommended daily intake of iodine in pregnancy.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
