["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about prolonging the life of an all ceramic crown placed on a mandibular canine. The paper [Methods aimed at lengthening the clinical crown: a review] discusses different methods for lengthening the clinical crown, but none of these methods directly relate to prolonging the life of a crown. The paper [Alternative crown systems] suggests that ceramic crowns are best limited to the anterior region of the mouth where occlusal forces normally are less than those found in the posterior region. Since the mandibular canine is part of the posterior region, this suggests that the occlusal forces may be higher and could potentially affect the longevity of the crown. The paper [The change of dimensions in bonded crowns] discusses how the dimension of a crown can change when it's faced with ceramic material. This information doesn't directly relate to prolonging the life of the crown, but rather highlights the importance of accurately fitting the crown. The paper [Coronal access of the canine dentition] is not relevant to this question.\n\nGiven these points, it seems that the main factor affecting the longevity of the crown would be the occlusal forces acting on it. To prolong the life of the crown, we could consider adjusting the bite or using a different restoration method that takes into account the increased occlusal forces in the posterior region.\", \n\"answer_choice\": C"]
