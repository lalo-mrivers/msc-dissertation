["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe three cases of monocytic leukaemia in dogs, which show raised white blood cell count with a great majority of monocytes and monoblasts. Experimental study on intradermal antitetanus antityphoid immunization does not mention increased monocytic count. Features of chronic myeloid leukemia at diagnosis describe the median white cell count as 132 x 10(9)/L, but the commonest symptoms are secondary to hypermetabolism and splenomegaly. Role of resection in typhoid perforation also does not mention increased monocytic count. Small cell lung carcinoma in a patient with Sotos syndrome: are genes at 3p21 involved in both conditions is not relevant to this question.\n\nTyphoid, as described in the Experimental study on intradermal antitetanus antityphoid immunization, can lead to increased monocytic count.\n\nNo other condition mentioned in the choices has a direct correlation with increased monocytic count. Therefore, the answer should be related to Typhoid.\n\nAmong the options provided, only one condition is directly associated with Typhoid: C: Sub-Acute Bacterial Endocarditis does not correlate with Typhoid and Sotos syndrome. The remaining two options are not relevant or not correlated with Typhoid: A: Parasitic infections (can cause monocytic count increase in rare cases) and C: Hodgkin's Lymphoma.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D: None of the above\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
