["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the presence of sodium iodide sympoer. Let's look at the relevant documents... The first document talks about liver alcohol dehydrogenase and carboxymethylation, but it doesn't mention sodium iodide sympoer. The second document discusses thyroid hormones and iodide intake, but it doesn't seem to be related. The third document is about proteolytic activity in rat thyroids and excess iodide intake, but again, no connection to sodium iodide sympoer. The fourth document talks about insulin and IGF-I inhibiting iodide transport in FRTL-5 rat thyroid cells, but it's still not relevant to the question. Finally, the fifth document describes a method for determining iodide concentrations in milk using an ion-selective electrode, which seems unrelated as well. Therefore, we can't find any information about sodium iodide sympoer in these documents.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
