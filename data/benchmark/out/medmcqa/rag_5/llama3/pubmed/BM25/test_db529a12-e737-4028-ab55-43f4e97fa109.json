["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe different forms of lactose intolerance, including infantile gastrogen lactose intolerance, acquired lactase deficiency, and adult lactose malabsorption. The patient presents with diarrhea and intolerance to dairy products due to lactase deficiency. The documents suggest that the defect in severe familial infantile lactose intolerance is localized in the gastric mucosa, whereas acquired lactase deficiency can appear later in childhood. In contrast, the document about Aspergillus niger beta-galactosidase demonstrates the effectiveness of enzyme replacement therapy in decreasing lactose malabsorption and its consequent intolerance in adult subjects with lactase deficiency.\n\nThe document about milk intolerance, lactose intolerance, and lactase deficiency in partial resection of the stomach suggests that milk intolerance can exceptionally be explained by lactase deficiency, but lack of lactase in the upper jejunum usually does not produce intolerance symptoms. The protein patterns of brush-border fragments in congenital lactose malabsorption and specific hypolactasia of the adult suggest that the mechanisms leading to low lactase activity in the congenital and adult forms of lactose intolerance are similar.\n\nThe document about elderly tolerance of dairy drinks suggests that most cases of milk intolerance may be psychosomatic in origin. Considering these findings, it is unlikely that the patient's symptoms are caused by a defect in gastric mucosa or upper jejunum.\n\nTherefore, the agent least likely to cause lactose intolerance among the given choices is B: Skimmed Milk, as it does not contain any additional ingredients that could contribute to lactase deficiency or intolerance beyond the inherent lactose content.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
