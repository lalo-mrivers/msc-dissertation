["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about changes that occur at full term in pregnancy. The provided documents do not contain direct information related to minute volume, GFR, blood volume, or cardiac output in the context of pregnancy. However, we can use the information from the document 'The effect of premature delivery on the development of gluconeogenic enzymes in the guinea pig' to make an educated guess. According to this document, the activity of hepatic glucose-6-phosphatase rose dramatically in prematurely delivered animals, but there was little significant change in activity in full term animals. This suggests that some biological processes may not be fully developed at full term.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: Cardiac output\"\n}"]
