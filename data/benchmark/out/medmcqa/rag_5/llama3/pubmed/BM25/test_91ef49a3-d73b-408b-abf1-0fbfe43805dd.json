["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about a lesion on the cheek with raised, pearly borders and telangiectasias. From the provided documents, I found a relevant description of 'intracranial pearly tumors' which mentions low density lesions with no enhancement after contrast medium injection. However, this is not directly related to skin lesions. Another relevant document describes 'giant' senile sebaceous hyperplasia, which has a sharply demarcated hyperplasia of grouped mature sebaceous glands with umbilications on its surface. This description matches the raised, pearly borders and telangiectasias described in the question. Therefore, I conclude that the likely diagnosis is senile sebaceous hyperplasia.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
