["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking which artery does not supply the circle of Willis. The documents provided describe various arteries and their connections to the circle of Willis. One document mentions posterior trifurcations of the inner carotid arteries, while another describes an incomplete arterial circle around the optic nerve head formed by terminal branches of two to three short posterior ciliary arteries. These descriptions suggest that the posterior-inferior cerebral artery is not part of the circle of Willis, as it is not mentioned in these contexts. Therefore, the correct answer is C: Posterior-inferior cerebral.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
