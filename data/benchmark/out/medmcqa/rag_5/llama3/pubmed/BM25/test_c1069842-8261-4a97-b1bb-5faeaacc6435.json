["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has been seizure-free for 2 years while taking levetiracetam. He now presents with agitation and anger issues possibly related to the drug intake. The issue is not seizures but behavioral problems. This suggests that the problem might be due to the medication rather than an underlying epilepsy condition.\n\nFebrile seizures and epilepsy: the contributions of epidemiology suggest that febrile seizures are distinct from epilepsy, which may indicate that the patient's current behavioral issues could be related to the antiepileptic drug rather than his underlying epilepsy. \n\nVigabatrin and psychosis report a series of cases where patients developed psychosis while taking vigabatrin. Although this is not levetiracetam, it suggests that antiepieleptic drugs can cause psychiatric problems.\n\nA case of traveler who showed heroin withdrawal after returning from abroad also supports the idea that behavioral changes can occur due to medication.\n\nIn conclusion, considering the patient's 2-year seizure-free interval and behavioral issues possibly related to the drug intake, the next best step is to address the behavioral problem rather than the underlying epilepsy condition. Therefore, option C: Slowly taper the drug over next 6 months should be considered.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
