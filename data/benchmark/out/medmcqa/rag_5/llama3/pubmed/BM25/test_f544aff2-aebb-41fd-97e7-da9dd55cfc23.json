["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking how to remove working side interference. Based on the first document 'Effects of working side interference on nocturnal bruxers', we know that the problem of working side interference arises from experimentally placed metal overlays on the buccal cusps of the upper second premolar and first molar, which discludes eccentric contacts without disturbing centric occlusion. The results show that the chewing movements shifted towards the non-interfered side with narrowed and vertical chews after placement of overlays. Therefore, to remove working side interference, we need to reverse this process by moving the chewing movements back to the original position.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"]
