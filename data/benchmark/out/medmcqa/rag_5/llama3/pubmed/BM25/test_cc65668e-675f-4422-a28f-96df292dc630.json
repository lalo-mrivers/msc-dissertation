["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents provided discuss various aspects of cement, including its use as a bone substitute and the risk of allergic contact dermatitis. The relevant information is found in three separate studies: one on contact allergic dermatitis, another on toxic ulcerative contact dermatitis due to prefabricated concrete (cement burns), and a third on the frequency of postoperative allergic contact dermatitis to topical antibiotics. From these studies, we can conclude that nickel is a common cause of contact sensitization in females, while mecaptobenzol-thiazole, chrome, and nickel are common sensitizers among male patients. In another study, it is mentioned that the length of occupational contact with cement was short among bricklayers, construction workers, and builders, and there was no sensitization against cobalt and nickel in this group.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
