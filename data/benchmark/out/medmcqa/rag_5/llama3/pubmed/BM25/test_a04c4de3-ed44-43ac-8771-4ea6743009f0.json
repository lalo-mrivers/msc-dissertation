["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Firstly, we need to analyze the given information. We know that 17o substrate is converted to product (12 microgram/ml) in 9 minutes. This means that the initial rate of reaction is 12/9 = 1.33 micrograms per minute.\n\nNow, let's consider what happens when the concentration of enzyme is changed to 1/3 and the concentration of substrate is doubled. The new concentration of substrate is 2 times the original concentration, which was equal to the Km value of the enzyme. So, the new concentration of substrate is also equal to the Km value.\n\nThe initial rate of reaction remains the same as long as the substrate concentration is not changing significantly. Since the substrate concentration is now at the Km value, the initial rate of reaction will be 1/3 of the original rate because the enzyme concentration has been reduced to 1/3.\n\nLet's calculate the new initial rate: 1.33 micrograms per minute / 3 = 0.44 micrograms per minute.\n\nThe amount of product formed after a certain time is proportional to the initial rate of reaction and the time elapsed. So, we can calculate the time taken for the same amount of product (12 microgram/ml) to be formed with the new enzyme concentration:\n\nTime = Total product / Initial rate\n= 12/0.44\n= 27 minutes\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C: 27 minutes.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
