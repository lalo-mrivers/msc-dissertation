["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents are related to different fields such as materials science and medicine. The question is asking about the coefficient of thermal expansion of a specific material relative to that of tooth. We can identify the relevant information in the documents. In 'Dimensional behavior of curing bone cement masses', it is mentioned that an overall expansion of 3 to 5 vol % has been mentioned in the literature for bone cements. This suggests that the coefficient of thermal expansion of bone cements is relatively high. The document on 'Thermoelasticity of red blood cell membrane' provides information on the thermal area expansivity, which is measured to be 1.2 X 10(-3)/degrees C. This value is likely higher than that of tooth. The other documents do not provide direct information on the coefficient of thermal expansion, but they provide context for understanding the question.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
