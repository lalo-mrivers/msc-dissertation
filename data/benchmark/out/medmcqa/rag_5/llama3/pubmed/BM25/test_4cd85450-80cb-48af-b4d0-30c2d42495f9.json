["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the curve that passes through the cusps of all the posteriors, reaches to condyle. Based on the provided documents, we need to find the relevant information that describes this curve. The document 'Application of \"cusp writer\" findings to practical and theoretical occlusal problems' seems to be most relevant. It talks about the cusp writer and its relation to the various occlusal determinants, including the plane (curve) of occlusion and the curve of Spee. According to this document, the steeper the curve of Spee, the more irregular the cusp height and angulations are with steeper anterior cusps and flatter posterior cusps. This suggests that as we move from anterior to posterior teeth, the curve of Spee passes through the cusps of all the posteriors and reaches the condyle.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
