["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question states that the bite was unprovoked, which means it's likely an accident rather than a deliberate attack. Rabies is a concern when there's an unprovoked dog bite, especially if the dog hasn't received proper vaccination. The surveys conducted among pet owners and the general population indicated that bites were common events (3.4%) and occurred more often in pet owners (8.6%). In 74% of the cases, victims belonged to the pet owner's family and one fourth of the accidents occurred when playing with the pet. However, 12% of the accidents resulted from apparently unprovoked aggressions.\n\nAccording to the epidemiology study on dog bites in Ibadan, 50% of the bites were unprovoked and 80.3% of the biting dogs belonged to known owners. This suggests that there's a possibility of rabies transmission if the bite was indeed unprovoked.\n\nGiven these facts, it seems reasonable to consider post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) for the boy, which includes cell culture-derived vaccine administration. The surveys mentioned earlier indicate that the incidence rate of dog bites in an urban area is around 37.5/100,000 persons/year, which means there's a non-negligible risk of rabies transmission.\n\nTherefore, I would recommend giving the 10-year-old boy cell culture-derived vaccine as part of PEP treatment.\",\n\"answer_choice\": A"]
