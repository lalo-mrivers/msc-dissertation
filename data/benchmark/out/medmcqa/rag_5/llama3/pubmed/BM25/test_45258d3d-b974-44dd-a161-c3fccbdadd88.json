["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks which option is not true for myelinated nerve fibers. Options A, B, and C are related to the characteristics of myelinated nerve fibers. Option D seems unrelated. Therefore, I will focus on options A-C. Myelinated nerve fibers have a speedier impulse conduction compared to non-myelinated fibers (option A is false). Membrane currents are indeed generated at nodes of Ranvier in myelinated nerve fibers (option B is true). Saltatory conduction is also a characteristic of myelinated nerve fibers (option C is true).\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
