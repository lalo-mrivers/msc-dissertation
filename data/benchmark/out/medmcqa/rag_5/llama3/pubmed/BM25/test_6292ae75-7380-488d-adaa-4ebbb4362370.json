["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the treatment of choice for a 35-year-old female with choriocarcinoma. We need to look at the relevant documents for clues. From the first document, we can see that in the third period (1972-1985), 5-Fu and/or KSM were used as therapeutic agents. However, this does not provide specific information about treatment options for a 35-year-old female with choriocarcinoma. The second document describes the long-term treatment of an infantile case of choriocarcinoma, which is not relevant to our question. The third document reports on a patient who received multiagent chemotherapy and conceived after completing therapy. This suggests that chemotherapy may be an option for treating choriocarcinoma. Finally, we can look at the fourth document, which discusses epidemiological features of choriocarcinoma, including treatment options. Unfortunately, this document does not provide specific information about the treatment of choice for a 35-year-old female with choriocarcinoma.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
