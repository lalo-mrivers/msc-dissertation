["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents provided don't explicitly discuss the most frequently recommended tooth brushing technique for periodontal patients. However, we can infer some information from the studies on dental prophylaxis and oral hygiene. The document 'Dental prophylaxis procedures in control of periodontal disease in Lucknow (rural) India' states that regular tooth brushing is essential to prevent plaque formation and maintain oral hygiene. Although it doesn't specifically mention a technique, it implies that a proper tooth brushing technique should be used. We can also look at the document 'Effect of tongue brushing on formation of dental plaque', which shows that tongue brushing did not have any effect on plaque formation when used as an adjunct to tooth brushing or as the only hygiene procedure. This suggests that a more effective technique may be necessary for periodontal patients.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"]
