["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"There is no information about the development of granules in a cell before ovulation in the provided documents. However, we can consider the context of the question. The question is related to ovulation and the provided documents are mostly focused on topics like mast cell granules, preimplantation mammalian embryo, platelet activating factor on ovulation, dynamic changes in chromaffin cell cytoskeleton as prelude to exocytosis, and rhythms of progesterone and corticosterone in the pms-treated rat. Based on this information, we can infer that the question is likely related to hormonal regulation of ovulation. Among the provided options, only FSH (follicle-stimulating hormone) could be a possible answer as it plays a crucial role in the development of follicles and granules in a cell before ovulation.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
