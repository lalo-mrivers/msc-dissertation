["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the best anticoagulant to send a sample for serum electrolyte measurement. According to the first document, commercially available capillaries containing calcium-titrated heparinate as an anticoagulant designed specifically for ionized calcium measurements in blood were tested with four serum pools with ionized calcium concentrations adjusted to 0.75, 1.25, 1.50 and 2.50 mmol/L. Although this is the best available anticoagulant for this purpose, the use of these capillaries induced a +/- 1% alteration of the original concentration around the titration level and changes of -2 to +10% at pathological values.\", \"answer_choice\": B}"]
