["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant document is [A study of root resorption of deciduous teeth in dogs. Influence of successional tooth germ and occlusal force]. According to this study, when the successional tooth germs are removed, root resorption is delayed. However, since we are considering bone resorption but no tooth resorption, we need to focus on the process of internal resorption. The study mentions that after half of the root has been resorbed, many odontoclasts are observed in the dental pulp of the deciduous tooth, leading to rapid resorption. This suggests that even without tooth resorption, bone resorption can continue until the root is fully resorbed.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
