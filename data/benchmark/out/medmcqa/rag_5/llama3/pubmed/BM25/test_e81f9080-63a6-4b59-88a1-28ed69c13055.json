["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant document is 'Frequency of tendon organ discharges elicited by the contraction of motor units in cat leg muscles.' This study discusses Golgi tendon organs (GTOs) and their response to muscle contractions. According to this study, GTOs do not simply detect length changes or respond dynamically only. Instead, they respond to contractile tension, which is a complex phenomenon involving variations in the number of muscle fibers contributed by different motor units to the bundle inserted on each receptor. This suggests that GTOs have a high threshold and are sensitive to the strength of individual motor units.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
