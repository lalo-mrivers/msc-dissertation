["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the conditions where serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT) is increased. We need to find relevant information from the provided documents. In 'Artifactual depression of serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase by metronidazole', we see that metronidazole absorbs at 340 nm, simulating reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, which is the final colorimetric product of the SGOT assay. This means that metronidazole can artificially decrease SGOT values. In 'Effect of valproic acid on hepatic function', we see that altered hepatic function tests occurred in four patients treated with valproic acid, and dose reduction resulted in reversion of serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT) and serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (SGPT) to normal. This suggests that SGOT is increased due to valproic acid treatment. Finally, in 'Influence of methoxyflurane-nitrous oxide analgesia during childbirth on renal and hepatic function', we see that blood urea and serum sodium and SGOT were increased following labour and nitrous oxide analgesia.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
