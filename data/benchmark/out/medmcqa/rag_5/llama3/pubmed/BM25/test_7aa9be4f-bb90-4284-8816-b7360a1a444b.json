["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking what increases calcium absorption from the gut. We have to look at the provided documents for information about calcium transport. In 'Effect of hypophysectomy on calcium transport by rat duodenum', we see that when transport data are corrected for mass of intestinal mucosa, the duodenum from hypophysectomized animals absorbs calcium more avidly due to an increase in lumen-to-plasma flux. This suggests that increasing mucosal weight can increase calcium absorption. In 'Effect of aminoacetonitrile on calcium metabolism and bone in the rat', we see that AAN increased true and apparent absorption of calcium. Therefore, it is likely that some factor would be necessary to block or reduce this effect. Looking at our choices, phytates (A) are known to inhibit mineral absorption, including calcium, so they could potentially decrease calcium absorption. Vitamin D (B) is known to increase calcium absorption, and alkaline pH in the gut (C) is also associated with increased calcium absorption. Protein in diet (D) does not directly affect calcium transport or absorption.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
