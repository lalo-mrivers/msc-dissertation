["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the provided documents, we can infer that Class-II malocclusion is associated with anterior open bite and over-jet. In 'Orthognathic surgery for the treatment of chronic self-mutilation of the lips', it is mentioned that alternative techniques involving orthognathic surgery to create an anterior open bite may result in cessation of self-mutilation. Similarly, in 'Advanced periodontal disease and development of anterior open bite', it is described how a severe anterior open bite can be treated with combined orthodontic and surgical correction.
