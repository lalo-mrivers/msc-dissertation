["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks which one of the following is not FDA approved. The provided options are potential dental drugs or products. Upon reviewing the documents, I notice that Gerovital (also known as GEM 215) is mentioned as a drug under review by the FDA, but it's not approved for its claims to 'reverse' aging. Additionally, Elyzol and Periochip are not mentioned in the provided documents, nor do they seem related to oral care or prescription drugs. Atridox, on the other hand, is a well-known product used in periodontal treatment. Given this information, I conclude that GEM 215 (Gerovital) is the only option that is not FDA approved.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
