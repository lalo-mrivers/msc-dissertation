["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the mechanism of action of bisphosphonates. The relevant documents describe that bisphosphonates can inhibit bone resorption, maintain bone formation, and have different effects on bone formation compared to cisplatin. Bisphosphonates also bind to calcium ions, which plays a crucial role in their mechanism of action. Disodium 1-hydroxy-3-(1-pyrrolidinyl)-propylidene-1,1-bisphosphonate (EB-1053) is a potent inhibitor of bone resorption and can increase metaphyseal bone mass dose dependently.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
