["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks which option is NOT true about ankylosing spondylitis. We can analyze the provided documents to find the correct answer. From the study 'Chronic otitis media: a new extra-articular manifestation in ankylosing spondylitis?', we know that ankylosing spondylitis has various extra-articular manifestations, including chronic otitis media. Therefore, option A (Enthesis is the primary site of pathology) is supported by the provided study. The other options do not seem to be directly contradicted by the given documents. However, further information suggests that ankylosing spondylitis typically affects males more than females. Therefore, option B (More common in Females) is unlikely to be true. There are no direct references in the provided studies to TNF's role in the pathogenesis of ankylosing spondylitis; therefore, option C (TNF plays an important role in the pathogenesis of ankylosing spondylitis) could be either true or false depending on additional information not provided here. Finally, from 'Comparison of radiographic abnormalities of the sacroiliac joint in degenerative disease and ankylosing spondylitis', we know that sacroiliitis is indeed a common manifestation of ankylosing spondylitis; therefore, option D (Sacroiliitis is the earliest manifestation of ankylosing spondylitis) is also supported by the provided study. In conclusion, the correct answer is B: More common in Females.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
