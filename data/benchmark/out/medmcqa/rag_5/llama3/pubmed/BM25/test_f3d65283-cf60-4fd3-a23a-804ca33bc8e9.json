["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To find the capillary oncotic pressure, we need to calculate the net filtration pressure. The interstitial hydrostatic pressure is 2 mm Hg, and the interstitial oncotic pressure is 7 mm Hg, so the total interstitial pressure is 9 mm Hg. Since the capillary hydrostatic pressure is 25 mm Hg, the net filtration pressure should be the difference between these two pressures: 25 - 9 = 16 mm Hg. However, we want a net filtration pressure of 3 mm Hg, so we need to subtract this value from the total interstitial pressure: 9 - 3 = 6 mm Hg. This is the capillary oncotic pressure.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
