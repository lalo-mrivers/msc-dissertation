["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents mention various enzymes such as urease, amylase, bilirubin complexes with a cationic polymer, and peroxidase. Based on this information, the question seems to be asking about an enzyme that is involved in a diffuse spreading inflammatory lesion. Peroxidase is one of the enzymes mentioned and it is catalyzing production of a color commensurate with the hydrogen peroxide produced. This suggests that peroxidase may be involved in the inflammation process. Therefore, based on this information, I think the correct answer is C: Peroxidase.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
