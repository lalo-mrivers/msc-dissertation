["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about ASO titre. The documents provided discuss the antistreptolysin-O test, which measures the level of antistreptolysin-O antibodies in a person's blood. From these tests, we can see that ASO titre can vary depending on age, geographical location, season, etc. This means that there is no such thing as normal ASO titre. Looking at the documents, we can see that ASO titre is high in comparison with another study (Rotorua Lakes) and there was an association between high ASO titre and throat swab positive for group A and group C streptococci. This shows that ASO titre can be increased in certain situations.\n\nThe question also asks about post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis, which is mentioned in one of the documents as having a possibly negative ASO titre. Carditis is not directly related to ASO titre, and the Jones criteria are not specifically discussed in the provided documents. School children are not directly related to the topic.\n\nBased on this information, we can conclude that ASO titre may be increased in school children, but there is no direct evidence for this in the provided documents.\", \n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
