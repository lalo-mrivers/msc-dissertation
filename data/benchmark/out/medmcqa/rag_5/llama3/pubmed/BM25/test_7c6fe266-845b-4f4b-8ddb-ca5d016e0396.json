["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents provide information on predictors of poliomyelitis case confirmation at initial clinical evaluation. The document 'Predictors of poliomyelitis case confirmation...' suggests that the best predictors are proximal muscle involvement, fever at onset of paralysis, and rapid progression of paralysis. This is important for AFP surveillance, as it allows local health officials to predict the likelihood of future confirmation as a case of poliomyelitis. Therefore, the key indicator for AFP surveillance is age < 6 years and either presence of fever at the onset of paralysis or a < 4-day period for complete development of paralysis.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: At least one case of non-polio AFP per year per 100000 population of under 15 years\"\n}"]
