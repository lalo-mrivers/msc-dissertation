["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the facilitation of eukaryotic mRNA binding to ribosomes. The passage that provides insight into this process is 'Distinct epitopes in eukaryotic initiation factor 2 for binding of mRNA and for ternary complex formation with methionyl-tRNA(f) and GTP.' According to this passage, eIF-2 forms a ternary complex with methionyl-tRNA(fMet) and GTP on one hand, and it binds to a specific site in mRNA molecules on the other. This suggests that binding of mRNA by eIF-2 is facilitated by the interaction between eIF-2 and mRNA.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
