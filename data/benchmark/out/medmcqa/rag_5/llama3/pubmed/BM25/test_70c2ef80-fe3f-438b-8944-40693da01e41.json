["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about improving marginal adaptation in a composite restoration. We need to look for documents that discuss this topic. In the document '[Core build-ups from composites--evaluation of the technics of application]', it is mentioned that acid etching of dentin definitely decreased marginal quality; therefore, for core construction using composites, the acid etch technique is not indicated. This suggests that acid etching is not a good way to improve marginal adaptation. In the document '[In-vitro research on the marginal adaptation of composites with the use of different dentin adhesives]', it is mentioned that the fillings in cavities bound by enamel exhibited a very good marginal adaptation of the composite, and the best results were obtained with Scotchbond 2, Mirage-Bond and Cavex-Clearfil-Newbond. This suggests that using the right adhesive material can improve marginal adaptation. In the document '[Evaluation of 16 months old variously fashioned incisor fillings]', it is mentioned that restorations inserted using the principles of Adhesive Restoration showed the best results. This suggests that the Adhesive Restoration technique, which involves a sealant composite system with a new cavity design, can improve marginal adaptation.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: Continued packing\""]
