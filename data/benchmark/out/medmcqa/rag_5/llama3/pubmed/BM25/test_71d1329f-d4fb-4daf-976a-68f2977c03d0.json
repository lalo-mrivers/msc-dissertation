["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the causes of porosity in an acrylic denture. The given documents are studies on different aspects of dentures, such as mechanical properties, heat-released stress, and reinforcement techniques. None of these studies directly discuss the causes of porosity in acrylic dentures. However, one study discusses dimensional changes in an acrylic resin denture blank that occur when the dentures are heated to a temperature of 90 degrees C or more. This could be related to porosity if it is caused by heat-induced expansion or shrinkage. Another study discusses the inhibition of Candida albicans adherence to acrylic and does not mention porosity at all. The other studies also do not discuss porosity. Therefore, we should look for information from other sources to answer this question.\", \n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
