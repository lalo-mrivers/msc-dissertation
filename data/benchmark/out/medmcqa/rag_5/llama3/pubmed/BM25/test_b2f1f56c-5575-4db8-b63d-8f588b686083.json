["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the given documents, it is clear that growth performance of children involves measuring both height and weight. In 'Growth of hyperkinetic children taking methylphenidate, dextroamphetamine, or imipramine/desipramine', measurements are converted to percentiles using tables of norms of the Iowa City study. Similarly, in 'National Study of Health and Growth: standards of attained height, weight and triceps skinfold in English children 5 to 11 years old', distributions of weight and triceps skinfold were positively skewed; logarithmic transformations led to satisfactory Normalized distributions. This suggests that a correlation between the height and weight of children would be best represented by a scatter diagram, which is a plot of data points on a graph with both height and weight axes.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
