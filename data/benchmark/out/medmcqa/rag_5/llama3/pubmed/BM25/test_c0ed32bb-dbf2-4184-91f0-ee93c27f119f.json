["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the transport of CO being diffusion limited. From the documents provided, it can be seen that the red cell membrane plays a crucial role in gas uptake, and the Bohr-Krogh assumption that red cell PCO = 0 during CO uptake is untrue. This suggests that the rate of CO uptake by red cells may be affected by the membrane's permeability. Furthermore, the pulmonary diffusing capacity for CO was measured to study the role of diffusion limitation in alveolar space (stratification) for pulmonary gas exchange function. The clear negative correlation between Dco and the molecular weight of the gases used suggests that an airway diffusion resistance limiting CO transfer. This implies that the transport of CO is indeed limited by its diffusion.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
