["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant document that describes Lefort 1 osteotomy is [Lefort 1 osteotomy. The proposal of an outline modification]. According to this document, the proposed modification involves 'down-fracture and pterygo-maxillary separation'. This suggests that the procedure involves more than two bones. Further reading of the document reveals that it proposes a modified outline of Lefort 1 osteotomy using an 'inverse step' design which ensures simple and effective down-fracture and pterygo-maxillary separation. Osteosynthesis of the mobilized fragment is facilitated due to the improved contact of bone surfaces, particularly laterally. Combined rigid and supple osteosyntheses allow some degree of post-operative adjustment.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
