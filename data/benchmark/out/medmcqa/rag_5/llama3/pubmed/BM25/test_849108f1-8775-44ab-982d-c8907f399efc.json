["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 16-year-old girl with primary amenorrhea. She has well-developed breasts (Tanner's stage 5) but minimal pubic hair (Tanner's stage 1). This suggests that the ovaries may be normal, as breast development is not typically affected by ovarian function. The lack of pubic hair and presence of minimal axillary hair suggests a possible disorder in androgen production or sensitivity. The patient's mother mentioned that she started developing breasts at age 12, which is consistent with normal puberty.\n\nThe provided documents describe cases of male pseudohermaphroditism with incomplete testicular feminization syndrome, Kallmann syndrome, and 17 alpha-hydroxylase deficiency. These conditions are all characterized by disorders in androgen production or sensitivity, which could explain the patient's symptoms.\n\nHowever, the most likely diagnosis is D: Androgen insensitivity, as it is the only option that directly addresses androgen production or sensitivity. The other options do not fit the patient's presentation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
