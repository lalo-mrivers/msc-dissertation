["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents provide information about the orbitotemporal venous sinuses of humans. The petrosquamous sinus empties into the postglenoid vein. In humans, the orbitotemporal sinus system is greatly modified. Its remnants persist for the most part as 'middle meningeal veins.' Meningeal tributaries are relatively large in humans, and drain principally into the cranio-orbital sinus or sphenoparietal sinus. The sphenoparietal sinus is an evolutionary novelty restricted to hominoids and is frequently developed in only Homo and Pongo.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
