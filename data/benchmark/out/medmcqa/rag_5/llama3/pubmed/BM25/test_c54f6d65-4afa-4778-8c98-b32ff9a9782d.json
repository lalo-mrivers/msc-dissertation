The presence of amblyopia suggests a possible relationship to unilateral amblyopia. Upon reviewing the relevant documents, I found that defective processing of motion-defined form is common in the fellow eyes of children with unilateral amblyopia. However, this document does not provide information on the cause of amblyopia in adults. Since the patient's symptoms are related to the heart rate and not specifically to vision, it is unlikely that the amblyopia is causing the tachycardia. I would then focus on the other possible causes mentioned in the question: nicotine, cannabis, atropine, and cocaine.

Since there is no specific information about the patient's behavior or exposure to any substances, I would focus on the most likely causes of tachycardia and extrasystole. Atropine is a possible cause of these symptoms, but it is not typically associated with amblyopia.\n\nBased on this analysis, I would choose...\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"]
