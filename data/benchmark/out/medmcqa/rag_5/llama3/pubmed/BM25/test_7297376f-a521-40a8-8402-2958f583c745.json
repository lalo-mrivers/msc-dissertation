["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the relationship between breast feeding and various factors such as maternal education, type of delivery, smoking, hospital practices, and socioeconomic status. Breast feeding is associated with improved speech quality, reading ability, and confidence in children. It is also important for preventing dehydration in infants with diarrhoea. The studies suggest that exclusive breast feeding may be influenced by multiple factors.\n\nIn this context, the question asks about associations between exclusive breast feeding and various outcomes. None of the options (A-D) seem to be directly related to the definition or outcome of exclusive breast feeding. Therefore, we need to focus on the relationships described in the studies.\n\nMaternal education is associated with both onset and duration of breast feeding. Type of delivery is significantly associated with onset of breast feeding, but not with duration. Smoking is associated only with duration of breast feeding, not with onset. This information does not suggest any relationship between exclusive breast feeding and hemolysis due to Vit-K deficiency (A), evening colic (B), golden colour stool (C), or prolongation of physiological jaundice (D).\n\nTherefore, the answer is that exclusive breast feeding may be associated with all of the following except - A: Hemolysis due to Vitâ€“K deficiency\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
