["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the percentage of phosphoric acid that cannot be rinsed off where Dicalcium phosphate monohydrate is formed. The relevant document is 'Phosphoric acid penetration during direct bonding'. According to this document, rinsing does not necessarily completely arrest the acid etching process in the depth of the exposed enamel, which suggests that some phosphoric acid may remain even after rinsing. However, it does not provide a specific percentage value for Dicalcium phosphate monohydrate formation.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
