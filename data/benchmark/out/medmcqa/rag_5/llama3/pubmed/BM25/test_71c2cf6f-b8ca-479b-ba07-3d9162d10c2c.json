["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the given documents, gingival recession refers to the shift of the marginal gingiva to a position apical to the cemento-enamel junction. This can occur at all tooth surfaces and can be either visible or hidden by the gingiva itself. The Gingival Recession Total (GRT) scoring system combines both visual and hidden portions of recession for a total score. Since the question asks about the most common cause of gingival recession, I will look for any information in the provided documents that might indicate what causes this phenomenon. Unfortunately, none of the given documents mention specific causes of gingival recession. However, one can infer from the description of gingival recession that it is not related to toothbrush trauma, TFO, deflective contacts, or ANUG, as these conditions are not directly mentioned in the context of gingival recession.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
