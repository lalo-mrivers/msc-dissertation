["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the origin of different cell types. From Thymus development in amphibians, we know that thymic lymphocytes are not derived from initial endodermal rudiments, but rather from mesenchyme-derived lymphoid stem-cells. In The endodermal origin of digestive and respiratory tract APUD cells, it is stated that APUD cells have morphologic characteristics of endodermal origin. In Cysts of the neuraxis of endodermal origin, colloid cysts and enterogenous cysts are shown to be derived from primitive foregut endoderm. Finally, Extragonadal endodermal sinus tumours report a case of an endodermal sinus tumour originating in the sacro-coccygeal region. Based on these studies, it can be concluded that cells of endodermal origin include epithelial cells of intestine, goblet cells, and hepatocytes.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
