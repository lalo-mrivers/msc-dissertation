["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks which of the options is not required for protein synthesis of eukaryotes. The relevant documents describe various aspects of DNA and protein synthesis, including the regulation of cyanide-insensitive respiration, transcription-translation coupling, and nuclear-directed protein synthesis in yeast cells. Protein synthesis in eukaryotes involves the translation of mRNA into protein on ribosomes. RNA polymerase is responsible for transcribing DNA into mRNA, while peptidyl transferase is an enzyme involved in peptide bond formation during translation. Amino acyl tRNA synthetase is not a direct participant in protein synthesis. Therefore, amino acyl tRNA synthetase is the option that is not required for protein synthesis of eukaryotes.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
