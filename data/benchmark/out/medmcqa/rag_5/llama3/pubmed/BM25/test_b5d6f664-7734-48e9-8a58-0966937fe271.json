["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about a non-synovial joint with connective tissue in between. The documents provided describe various types of joints and connective tissues. Synovial joints are characterized by the presence of synovial fluid, which is not present in the described type of joint. Therefore, we can rule out options B (Synchondrosis) and A (Syndesmosis), as they are both types of synovial joints. Option C (Saddle) is a type of fusion between two bones that does not involve connective tissue. Option D (Suture) is the only option left, as it refers to a type of joint that connects two bones with fibrous connective tissue.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
