["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the property affected due to diameter of nerve fiber/axon. In the provided documents, we can see that changes in the diameter of myelinated axons are mentioned. Specifically, in the document 'Quantitative studies on the regeneration of myelinated nerve fibers. II. Variations of the number and size of regenerating nerve fibers after localized crushing or total section', it is stated that the mean diameter of myelinated axons decreased by 5% after section without suture, but increased by 11% after resection. In the document 'Morphologic and morphometric study of the facial nerve in clinically normal adult dogs', it is reported that the mean fiber diameter of the facial nerve was 3.92 +/- 1.18 microns, with approximately 89% of fibers having a diameter between 3 and 6 microns. Therefore, we can conclude that changes in the diameter of myelinated axons affect the property of amplitude.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: Amplitude\"\n}"]
