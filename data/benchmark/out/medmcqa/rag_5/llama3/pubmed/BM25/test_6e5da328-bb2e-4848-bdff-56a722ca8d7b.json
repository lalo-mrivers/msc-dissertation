["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the shelf life of a colourless, aqueous solution of suxamethonium. We need to look for information related to the stability of esters of corticosteroids in one of the provided documents. In the document 'N-substituted (aminomethyl)benzoate 21-esters of corticosteroids as water-soluble, solution-stable and biolabile prodrugs', we can see that the half-life of hydrolysis in 80% plasma ranged from 8 min to 342 min. This suggests that these esters are relatively stable in aqueous solutions. The document also mentions that the shelf life of an aqueous solution (pH 4.0) of this ester was predicted to be 6 years at 25 degrees C.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: 3 yr\"\n}"]
