["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the interactions and uses of cephalosporins. From the provided documents, we can see that cephalosporins interact with red blood cell membranes (Cephalosporin-induced hemolysis) and have different effects on tubular-toxic effects compared to aminoglycosides (Tubular-toxic effects of aminoglycosides and their combinations with cephalosporins). Additionally, they are used for treating bacterial meningitis (Cephalosporins in childhood bacterial meningitis) but not specifically for upper respiratory tract infections. Therefore, we can conclude that option D is the exception.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
