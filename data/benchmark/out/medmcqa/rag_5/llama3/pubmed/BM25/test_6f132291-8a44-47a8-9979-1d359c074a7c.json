["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the distribution of nerve fibers showing substance P- and calcitonin gene-related peptide-like immunoreactivity in the rat larynx. The study found a high degree of co-existence of SP- and CGRP-like immunoreactivity (LI) in the nerve fibers in the larynx, with richly supplied sites including the laryngeal side of the epiglottis and the ventral recess. There was no evidence of nerve fibers in the squamous epithelium of the vocal cords, but a moderate number of fibers was present where the squamous epithelium changed into a cuboidal epithelium. The paper also notes that unilateral sympathectomy did not affect the pattern of SP- and CGRP-innervation in the larynx, whereas after vagotomy, the SP- and CGRP-innervation almost disappeared ipsilaterally in the upper parts of the epiglottis and aryepiglottic folds. Considering this information, we can infer that the nerve supply of the mucosa of the larynx from epiglottis to the level of the cords is likely related to the vagus nerve.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
