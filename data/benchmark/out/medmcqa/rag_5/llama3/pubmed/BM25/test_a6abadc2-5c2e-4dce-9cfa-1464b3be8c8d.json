["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about Giemsa stained smear, which was used to detect changes in acrosomes of frozen ram spermatozoa, as well as to identify malaria parasites and Trichomonas vaginalis infection. The technique involves fixing the slides for 15 minutes in buffered formal saline and staining for 90 minutes in a 6 per cent (v/v) buffered solution of Giemsa stain.
