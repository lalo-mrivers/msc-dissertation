["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's PPH is accompanied by prolonged APTT and PTT, while BT, PT, and platelet counts are normal. This suggests that the coagulopathy is not due to thrombocytopenia or fibrinogen deficiency. The fact that APTT and PTT are prolonged points towards a diagnosis involving abnormal clotting pathways. Among the options, acquired hemophilia and lupus anticoagulant are more likely than DIC, which typically presents with thrombocytopenia, and inherited congenital hemophilia, which is typically diagnosed in children.\n\nFurthermore, based on the provided documents, there is no mention of alloimmunisation or treatment with vincristine, which rules out some possible causes. The precision of duplicate prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time assays in neonates suggests that prolonged PTT can occur without thrombocytopenia.\n\nGiven these factors, the most likely diagnosis is either acquired hemophilia or lupus anticoagulant, as they are both known to cause prolongation of APTT and PTT.\", \"answer_choice\": B}"]
