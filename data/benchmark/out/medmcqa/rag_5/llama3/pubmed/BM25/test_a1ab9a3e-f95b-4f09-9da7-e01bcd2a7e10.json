["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Firstly, I will look for the definition of diarthroses. Diarthroses are a type of joint that allows movement between bones. Now, let's review the options. Option A, Plane, is not a type of joint. Option B, Symphyses, is also not a type of joint as it refers to a type of joint where bones fuse together. Options C and D refer to specific types of joints: condyloid and saddle joints, respectively. Now, I will review the relevant documents provided. The document 'Spontaneous diseases in a closed colony of Praomys (Mastomys) natalensis' discusses various diseases found in rats, including degenerative joint disease of diarthroses. This suggests that diarthroses are indeed a type of joint. Therefore, I can confidently say that Symphyses is the only option that is not a diarthroses-type of joint.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
