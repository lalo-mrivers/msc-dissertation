["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, we can start by analyzing the frequency of B. fragilis isolation from clinical samples. According to 'Recovery of Bacteroides fragilis group from clinical specimens following antimicrobial therapy', B. fragilis accounted for 62% of all B. fragilis group isolates. This suggests that B. fragilis is indeed one of the most frequent anaerobes isolated from clinical samples, but we cannot determine whether it's the most frequent or not based on this information alone.\n\nWe can also analyze the antibiotic susceptibility of B. fragilis subspecies. According to 'Antibiotic susceptibility of the subspecies of Bacteroides fragilis', all strains were susceptible to chloramphenicol, and only one strain had a minimal inhibitory concentration of 12.5 Î¼g/ml for clindamycin. This suggests that B. fragilis is not necessarily sensitive to metronidazole.\n\nFurthermore, we can analyze the structure of the polysaccharide capsule of Bacteroides fragilis. According to 'The polysaccharide capsule of Bacteroides fragilis subspecies fragilis: immunochemical and morphologic definition', a large-molecular-weight capsular polysaccharide was isolated from strains of B. fragilis, which may play some role in the adherence of B. fragilis.\n\nBased on these findings, we can conclude that the statements are true except for one. The correct answer is D: Shock & DIC are common in Bacteroides bacteremia. There is no information provided in the given documents that suggests shock and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) are common in B. fragilis bacteremia.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
