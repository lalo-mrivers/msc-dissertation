This suggests that the answer might be related to imaging or X-rays. Upon reviewing the options, we see that Gamma ray is an option. Considering that metrizamide brain penetrance was studied using 131I-labelled metrizamide concur with these CT cisternographic findings, it's likely that the maximum penetration refers to Gamma rays.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
