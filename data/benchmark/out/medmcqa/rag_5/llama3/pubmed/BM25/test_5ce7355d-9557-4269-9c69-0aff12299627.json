["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The passage suggests that deciduous teeth show a lower degree of dental fluorosis compared to permanent teeth. This could be due to thinner enamel layer of primary teeth which may explain the lower degree of dental fluorosis in these teeth rather than a maternal barrier to fluoride. Therefore, it is unlikely that placenta acts as a barrier. The passage also suggests that the rapidly growing skeleton of infants does not prevent fluoride-derived enamel changes, so option B is also unlikely. The calcification time of deciduous teeth is likely similar to permanent teeth, but with a thinner enamel layer, they may be less prone to fluorosis. Therefore, C is a plausible explanation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"]
