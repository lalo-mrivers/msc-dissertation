["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, I can see that obturation is a technique used to fill or seal a cavity, canal, or prosthetic device. In the context of root canal treatment, obturation is done after shaping and cleaning. The question asks for a pure histological landmark for termination of these procedures. Apical constriction refers to the narrowest part of the apical canal, which can be used as a reference point for terminating cleaning and obturation. Apical foramen refers to the opening of the root canal at the apex, but it's not a direct indicator of the end of the canal. CDJ (cementodentinal junction) is not directly related to root canal treatment or obturation. Therefore, I conclude that C: Apical constriction is the correct answer.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
