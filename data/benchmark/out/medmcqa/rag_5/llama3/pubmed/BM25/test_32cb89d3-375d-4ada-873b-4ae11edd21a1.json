["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the percentage of maxillary 1st molars with two palatal roots. We can find the answer by looking at the documents related to morphologic studies of maxillary molars. Specifically, we need to look for information on the frequency of two root canals in the palatal root of first molars. After searching through the documents, we found that a study observed that 25% of the first molars presented four (4) root canals, which implies that some of these may have two root canals in the palatal root. Based on this information, we can estimate the percentage of maxillary 1st molars with two palatal roots.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
