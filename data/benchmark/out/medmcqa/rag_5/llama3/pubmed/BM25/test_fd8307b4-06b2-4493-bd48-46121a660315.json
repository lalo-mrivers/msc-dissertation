["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The document does not provide information about the different generations of impedance-based apex locators. The relevant documents discuss electronic apex localizers, universal ferro-probe pole locator, and impedance audiometry. There is no mention of Generation 1, 2, 3, or 4. Therefore, it cannot be determined which generation corresponds to an impedance-based apex locator.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
