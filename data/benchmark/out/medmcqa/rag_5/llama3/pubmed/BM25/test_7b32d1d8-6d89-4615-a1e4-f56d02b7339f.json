["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about a tooth with a non-functional cusp. From the given documents, I can see that the documents are related to teeth and their cusps, but none of them explicitly state which tooth has a non-functional cusp. However, one document (Relationship between size of distal accessory tubercles and hypocones in permanent maxillary molar crowns of southern Africans) mentions the hypocone as being unrelated to the function of the tooth. This suggests that the hypocone may be a non-functional cusp.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
