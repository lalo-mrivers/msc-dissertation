["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe yeast seryl tRNA synthetase with two sets of substrate sites involved in aminoacylation. The side-by-side model of two tRNA molecules allowing the alpha-helical conformation of the nascent polypeptide during the ribosomal transpeptidation is discussed. Another document describes the status of tRNA charging, trinucleotide acceptor sequence and tRNA nucleotidyltransferase activity in the human placenta. Finally, another paper explains how tRNAs and mRNA are arranged in the ribosome. Considering these documents, we can conclude that the enzyme that attaches an amino acid to a tRNA is indeed aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (A). The structure of tRNA molecules is also described, which shows that they contain several sho, double-helical regions (B) and that the attachment of an amino acid occurs at the acceptor stem (not necessarily at the 3' end, as C suggests). Additionally, it is clear that there are more than one tRNA for each amino acid, not just two (D).\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
