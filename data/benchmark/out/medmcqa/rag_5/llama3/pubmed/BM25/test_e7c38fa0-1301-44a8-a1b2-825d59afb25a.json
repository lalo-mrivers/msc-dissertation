["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the maximum torque during implant placement. There are no relevant documents provided that specifically mention the maximum torque value. However, one document discusses torsional strength of osteotomized rabbit tibio-fibular bones fixed with 6-hole stainless steel AO/DCP plates, which can provide some insight into the concept of torque. Another document describes a study on placement of endosseous implants into tooth extraction sites and mentions treating small defects present after implant placement with dense, nonresorbable hydroxylapatite. This information is not directly related to the maximum torque value but provides some context about the process of implant placement. Therefore, it seems that there is no specific document that provides a clear answer to this question.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
