["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks for a continuous variable. We can look at the provided documents to identify which variables are discrete or categorical, and which ones are continuous. For example, blood groups A, B, ABO (option C) is a categorical variable. Similarly, hemoglobin levels, serum gastrin levels, age in years and months (option D), etc. are all continuous variables. Among the given options, only height in cms (option A) and weight in kg (option B) are physical measures that can be quantified as continuous variables. Therefore, we can conclude that height in cms and weight in kg are the only continuous variables among the provided options.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A/B\"}"]
