["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"After reviewing the documents, I noticed that there are no specific measurements provided for the mesiodistal width to height of crown of maxillary canine. However, I can use the information on tooth size and dental arch dimensions from the studies to make an educated estimate.\n\nAccording to the study 'Mesiodistal crown dimension of the permanent dentition of American Negroes', the mean width of the maxillary first premolars was reported. Similarly, the study 'Tooth, chin, bone and body size correlations' mentions that the mesiodistal widths of the mandibular lateral incisors and canines were independently related to the thickness of the cortex of the second metacarpal.\n\nFrom these studies, I can infer that there is a general trend for the width of the maxillary canine to be slightly larger than its height. However, without specific measurements, it's difficult to determine the exact ratio.\n\nThe study 'Metric characteristics of the canine dental complex in prenatally androgenized female rhesus monkeys' provides information on the clinical crown lengths (L) and mesiodistal and buccolingual widths of the maxillary canines. However, this data is not directly applicable to human teeth.\n\nBased on my analysis, I would estimate that the ratio of mesiodistal width to height of crown of maxillary canine is likely to be around 8:10 or 10:08.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
