["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the design of clinical trials for cancer chemoprevention agents, the Quality of Life Committee's efforts to promote quality of life assessment in phase III trials, and the results of a prospective study on the impact of phase I clinical trials on the quality of life of patients with cancer. None of these documents explicitly state the major aim of phase 1 clinical trials, but we can infer that it is related to safety, as phase I trials are used to evaluate the safety and tolerability of new agents or treatments. This is supported by the fact that the study on the impact of phase I clinical trials on quality of life found no significant changes in overall quality of life or performance status following one course of phase I therapy.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
