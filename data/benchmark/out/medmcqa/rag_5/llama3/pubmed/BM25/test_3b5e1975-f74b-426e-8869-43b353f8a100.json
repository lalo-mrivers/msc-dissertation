["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about high copper silver alloy compared to conventional alloy. We need to find which statement is not true based on the given documents. The first document talks about the cytotoxicity of different alloys, including silver-tin-zinc and silver-copper alloys. There's no mention of high copper alloys. The second document discusses non-gamma2 amalgam alloys, which do contain copper, but it doesn't compare them to conventional alloys or make any statements about their properties in terms of tensile and compressive strength. The third document compares the compressive strength of different glass ionomers with or without dental amalgam alloy incorporation, but again there's no mention of high copper alloys. Finally, the fourth document discusses the amalgamation reaction of a low silver, high copper alloy powder, which is not relevant to the question. Therefore, we need to analyze the statements and see if any of them are not supported by the given documents.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
