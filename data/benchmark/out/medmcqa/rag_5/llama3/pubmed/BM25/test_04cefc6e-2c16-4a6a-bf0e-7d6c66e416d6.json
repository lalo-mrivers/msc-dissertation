["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the characteristics of Streptococcus mutans that make it a principal etiologic agent of caries. The relevant documents mention that S. mutans produces organic acids and has fructanase, an enzyme capable of degrading beta(2,6)- and beta(2,1)-linked fructans. This suggests that the organism is involved in carbohydrate metabolism. There is no evidence to suggest that it forms a gelatinous matrix or derives energy from enamel constituents. It does not live symbiotically with lactobacillus as this is not related to its role in caries.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
