["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the saliva of a caries-free individual. From the provided documents, we can infer that caries-free individuals have serum antibody titers against S. mutans, but these antibodies are unlikely to play a major role in protection against dental caries (document 1 and document 2). Also, plaque samples from caries-free subjects showed a lower incidence of S. mutans than those from caries-active subjects (document 3). No information is available about the buffering capacity for acids of saliva from caries-free individuals.\", \"answer_choice\": C}"]
