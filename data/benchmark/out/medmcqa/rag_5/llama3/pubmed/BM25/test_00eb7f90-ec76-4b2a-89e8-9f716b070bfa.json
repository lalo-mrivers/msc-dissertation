["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, basal cell carcinomas are discussed as a common human tumor that can occur sporadically or as part of a hereditary disease called basal cell nevus syndrome. The latter is characterized by the development of multiple tumors at an earlier age. In the text 'Loss of heterozygosity at chromosome 1q22 in basal cell carcinomas and exclusion of the basal cell nevus syndrome gene from this site', it is mentioned that these tumors generally appear sporadically and in small numbers, with rare cases appearing in great numbers and at an earlier age as a manifestation of the hereditary disease. This suggests that basal cell carcinomas can occur on the skin, which is not specifically mentioned in any of the other documents.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
