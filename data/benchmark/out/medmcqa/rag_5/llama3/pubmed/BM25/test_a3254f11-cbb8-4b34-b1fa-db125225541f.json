["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to the documents, amphotericin B can alter the permeability of human erythrocyte membranes to cations. Specifically, it reduces K+ transport across the membrane. Therefore, if a patient on amphotericin B develops hypokalemia (low potassium levels), it is likely due to the antibiotic's effect on K+ transport. As such, we can infer that the patient requires K+ supplementation.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: 120-160 mEq over 24 hours\""]
