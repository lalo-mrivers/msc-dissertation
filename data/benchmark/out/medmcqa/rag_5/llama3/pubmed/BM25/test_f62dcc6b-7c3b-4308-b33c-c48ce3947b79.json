["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about an anaesthetic agent causing adrenal suppression. Upon reviewing the provided documents, I noticed that one of the documents (Suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis after subcutaneous cortisone acetate administration in rats) discusses corticosteroid-induced adrenal atrophy and suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. This suggests that corticosteroids can cause adrenal suppression.\n\nI then reviewed the anaesthetic agents listed as potential choices. Beclomethasone dipropionate, mentioned in one of the documents (Beclomethasone dipropionate and chronic asthma), is a corticosteroid. Therefore, it's possible that beclomethasone dipropionate could cause adrenal suppression.\n\nHowever, upon reviewing the other anaesthetic agents listed as potential choices, I didn't find any direct evidence linking them to adrenal suppression.\n\nTherefore, based on my analysis of the provided documents and considering the potential choices, I believe that Beclomethasone dipropionate is the most likely choice.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
