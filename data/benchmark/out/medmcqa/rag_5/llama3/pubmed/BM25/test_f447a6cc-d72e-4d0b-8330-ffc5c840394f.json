["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the response to intravenous norepinephrine in a patient with septic shock. The relevant documents describe the effects of various substances on vascular smooth muscle and the cardiovascular abnormalities associated with septic shock. Norepinephrine is an alpha-adrenergic agonist that can cause vasoconstriction. In this context, it would be expected to increase blood pressure, heart rate, and peripheral resistance. The document does not provide direct information about norepinephrine's effects in septic shock patients, but similar studies on isolated rat aortic rings showed that sera from septic patient or dog decreased tension by 30% or 36%, respectively.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C: Increase in mean aerial pressure\""]
