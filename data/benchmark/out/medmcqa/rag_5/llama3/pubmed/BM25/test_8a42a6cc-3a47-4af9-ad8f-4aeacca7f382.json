["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about how enzymes are classified. The documents provided do not mention the classification of enzymes explicitly. However, we can look at the papers that discuss the classification of dermatophytes and tumors. In [Moder classification of dermatophytes], there is no mention of enzyme classification. Similarly, in [Tumor host relations. II. Influence of tumor extent and tumor site on plasma cortisol of patients with malignant diseases], enzymes are mentioned but not classified. The paper [Enzymes of carbohydrate metabolism in human epidermal tumors. 3. Enzymes between glucose and triose-phosphate] discusses the activities of five enzymes, but does not provide information on how they are classified. Therefore, we can infer that enzyme classification is not discussed in any of these papers.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
