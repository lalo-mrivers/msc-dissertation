["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"There are no documents that mention the half-life of TGF-beta. The relevant documents describe the expression and regulation of TGF-beta isoforms by human articular chondrocytes, the spatial and temporal analysis of TGF-beta 2 and TGF-beta 3 in the chick heart during valve formation, interactions between retinoids and TGF-betas in mouse morphogenesis, the tissue distribution of TGF-beta-1 RNA within whole mouse embryos from implantation to 10.5 days gestational age, and cadmium's action on NRK-49F cells to produce responses induced also by TGF-beta. None of these documents provide information about the half-life of TGF-beta.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
