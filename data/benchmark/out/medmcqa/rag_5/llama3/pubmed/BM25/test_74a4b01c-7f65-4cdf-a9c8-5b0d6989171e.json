["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, we can infer that radiation therapy can cause skin reactions. In 'Enhanced normal tissue response to radiation in a patient with discoid lupus erythematosus', widespread moist desquamation occurred after a skin dose of only 17 Gy. This suggests that even low doses of radiation can cause significant skin damage. Additionally, 'Chromosomal abnormalities in skin following total body or total lymphoid irradiation' shows that radiotherapy can induce extensive and sustained chromosome abnormalities in skin fibroblasts. In 'Basal-cell tumors of the lumbar skin after radiotherapy for arthrosis', repeated irradiations caused basal-cell tumor development in the skin.\n\nConsidering these documents, it is likely that the patient will show some kind of skin reaction or damage after 2 weeks of radiation therapy.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
