["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents provide information on the vascular system, specifically on blood flow and pressure. The question asks about the definition of pressure in the absence of blood flow. We can infer that this refers to the situation where there is no net blood flow, but rather a balance between inflow and outflow. From the provided documents, we can identify the relevant section that discusses the pulmonary vascular resistance. In this context, we find that prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) increases pulmonary vascular resistance in dogs, swine, and lambs. This suggests that pressure in the absence of blood flow is related to the vascular resistance.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
