["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks what Gardner syndrome does NOT include. We need to find information that explicitly states or implies that it is not a part of the syndrome. Upon reviewing the provided documents, we see that osteomas are mentioned as an extracolonic manifestation in 'Extracolonic manifestations of the familial adenomatous polyposis syndromes'. This suggests that osteomas are indeed included in the Gardner syndrome. Similarly, epidermoid cysts are also mentioned as an extracolonic manifestation in this document. The other options, osteosarcoma and impacted permanent teeth, do not appear to be related to the Gardner syndrome or its extracolonic manifestations.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
