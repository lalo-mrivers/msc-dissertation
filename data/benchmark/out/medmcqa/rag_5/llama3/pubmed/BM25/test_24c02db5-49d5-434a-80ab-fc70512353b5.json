["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The contractile part of intrafusal fibres is described as being located at the poles or ends of the fibre. In the document 'Cinematographic analysis of contractile events produced in intrafusal muscle fibres by stimulation of static and dynamic fusimotor axons', it is mentioned that dynamic gamma axons induce a contraction only in nuclear bag fibres which, in addition, never received any static gamma innervation. This suggests that the contractile part of these fibres is located at one or both ends.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
