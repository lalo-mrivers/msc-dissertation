["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the blood sample reaction when antiserum A and antiserum B are added, along with Rh +ve factor. Since no agglutination is seen, this suggests that there is no reaction between the antigens in the blood sample and the antiserum. Therefore, we can rule out any possibility of an ABO group system reaction (A or B). The presence of Rh+ve factor indicates that the blood sample has a positive Rh factor, which does not affect the ABO grouping. So, the correct answer is either O group with Rh +ve or AB group with Rh +ve.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
