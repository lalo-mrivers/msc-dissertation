["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The Km value is the substrate concentration at which the enzyme activity is half-maximal. This can be inferred from several places in the documents. For example, in document 1, it states that snail beta-mannosidase showed a Km value of 0.05 mM toward MU-beta-Man and could not be inhibited by Man, GlcNAc, Man beta(1-4)GlcNAc, Man beta(1-4)GlcNAc beta(1-N)urea or Man beta(1-4) GlcNAc beta(1-4)GlcNAc. Similarly, in document 2, it states that the Km value of the snail enzyme towards Man beta(1-4)GlcNAc, as measured by HPLC, was 10 mM, explaining the lack of inhibition.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
