["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the provided documents, I can see that lung recoil refers to the tendency of the lungs to recoils outward when they are deflated. Chest wall recoil is similar but refers to the tendency of the chest wall to expand when it is relaxed. The relationship between these two recoil pressures is described in several of the documents.\n\nFor example, the 'Sex and age differences in pulmonary mechanics' document mentions that lung recoil pressure at full inflation was higher in young men than in young women, which suggests that there may be some degree of balance between lung and chest wall recoil.\n\nAnother relevant document is 'Relationship of lung recoil to lung volume and maximum expiratory flow in normal children', which shows that the ratio of functional residual capacity (FRC) to total lung capacity (TLC) increases with age. This suggests that the outward recoil of the chest wall increases as we get older, and this may be related to the balance between lung and chest wall recoil.\n\nIn any case, based on these documents, I would conclude that in a relaxed state, the chest wall and lung recoil are balanced at FRC.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
