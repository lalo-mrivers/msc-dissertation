["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the potential effect of adding verapamil to a patient already taking metoprolol. We need to look for interactions between these two drugs. From the provided documents, we can see that there is a study on Pharmacokinetic interaction between verapamil and metoprolol in the dog. This study shows that verapamil inhibited both the systemic and oral clearance of metoprolol by about 50-70%. The first-pass effect of metoprolol was completely abolished after co-administration of verapamil, reflecting a marked alteration in the degree of hepatic extraction of metoprolol from intermediate to low. Therefore, we can expect that adding verapamil to metoprolol therapy may result in changes to the metabolism and clearance of metoprolol.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
