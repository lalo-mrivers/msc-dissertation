["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the infection of human natural killer (NK) cells with replication-defective human T cell leukemia virus type I provirus. It is mentioned that HTLV-I-infected NK cells were phenotypically indistinguishable from their uninfected counterparts, but retained the ability to mediate both natural and antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity. Additionally, it is stated that murine C-type viral antigens do not influence mouse NK cell activity against human cell lines. Furthermore, an immunomodulator, 7-thia-8-oxoguanosine, was found to activate NK cells in mice. However, there is no information provided on the effectiveness of NK cells against viral infected cells. Therefore, we can infer that the answer is not among the choices.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"None of the above\"\n}"]
