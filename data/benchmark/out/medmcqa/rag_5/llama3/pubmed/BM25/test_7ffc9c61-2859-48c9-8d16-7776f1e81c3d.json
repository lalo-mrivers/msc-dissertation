["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for information about COPD. The relevant documents mention that COPD is characterized by irreversible obstruction of the airways. This suggests that FEV1 (Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 second) would be decreased, as well as MEFR (Maximum Expiratory Flow Rate). RV (Residual Volume) and diffusion capacity are not directly related to the obstruction of airways, so they do not fit with the characteristic of COPD. Therefore, the correct answer is C: Increased RV.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
