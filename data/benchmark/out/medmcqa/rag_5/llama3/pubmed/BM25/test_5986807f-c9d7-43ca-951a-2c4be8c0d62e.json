["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the orientation of muscle fibers. From the given documents, it can be inferred that aminergic fibers are oriented parallel to the course of the folium (Mode of distribution of aminergic fibers in the cerebellar cortex of the chicken). Additionally, motoneurons innervating tongue muscles that are oriented parallel to the long axis of the tongue are located in the lateral divisions of the hypoglossal nucleus (Musculotopic organization of the hypoglossal nucleus in the cynomolgus monkey).\n\nBased on this information, it can be inferred that some muscles have parallel-oriented fibers. The question is asking about which muscle does not have parallel-oriented fibers.\n\nThe document 'Histochemical fiber composition of lumbar back muscles in the cat' provides information about the orientation of fibers in different muscles. According to this document, type II B fibers are characterized by a high percentage in some muscles (longissimus, iliocostalis and sacrocaudalis dorsalis lateralis) which implies that these muscles have parallel-oriented fibers.\n\nThe document '[Morphological and functional variations of the muscles of invertebrates]' discusses the evolution of muscle fibers among Invertebrates. This information is not directly relevant to the question.\n\nThe document '[The characteristics of the reparative process in the muscles when deprived of their functional loads]' discusses the repair process in muscles but does not provide any information about the orientation of fibers in different muscles.\n\nBased on this analysis, it can be inferred that muscles with parallel-oriented fibers include longissimus, iliocostalis and sacrocaudalis dorsalis lateralis. Therefore, the muscle that does not have parallel-oriented fibers is one that is mentioned as having a high proportion of type I and II A fibers.\n\nThis implies that the Tibialis anterior muscle has parallel-oriented fibers (as it is characterized by a high percentage of type II B fibers) whereas Saorius, Rectus abdominis, and Sternohyoid muscles do not have parallel-oriented fibers.\n\nThe answer is D: Tibialis anterior\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
