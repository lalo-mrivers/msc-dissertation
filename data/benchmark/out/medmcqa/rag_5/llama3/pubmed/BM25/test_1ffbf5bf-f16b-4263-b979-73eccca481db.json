["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the incidence of two canals in mandibular incisors. From the provided documents, we have information about root canal morphology of mandibular incisors (Root canal morphology of mandibular incisors). This study found that 100 mandibular central and lateral incisors had one root canal each. There is no mention of two or more canals in this study. Therefore, it's unlikely that the incidence of two canals in mandibular incisors is high.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: Less than 3%\""]
