["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about which hormone acts by crossing the cell membrane. From the provided documents, we know that peptide hormones generally act through membrane receptors (from [Hormone receptors and hormone action]). Steroid hormones, on the other hand, are present in the cytosol and bind to specific proteins, leading to changes in protein conformation (from [Hormone receptors and hormone action]). Therefore, it is likely that a peptide hormone would be the answer.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
