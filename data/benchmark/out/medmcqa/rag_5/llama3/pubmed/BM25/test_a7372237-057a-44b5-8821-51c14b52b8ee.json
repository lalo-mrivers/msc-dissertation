["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about excessive bleeding during oral surgery. I will look at the relevant documents to find information that might help answer this question. The document 'Penicillin treatment in oral surgery in patients with coagulation disorders' does not seem relevant to this question. The document 'Oral anticoagulant therapy in patients undergoing dental surgery' mentions that postoperative bleeding can be controlled by local measures, but it doesn't specifically address the position of the patient during oral surgery. The document '[Comparison of the effects of epsilon-aminocaproic acid and aprotinin on intra- and postoperative bleeding in heart surgery]' is about cardiac surgery, not oral surgery. The document 'Excessive fibrinolysis in amyloidosis associated with elevated plasma single-chain urokinase' is about amyloidosis, not oral surgery. Therefore, I will look at the document 'Coagulation studies of patients taking low-dose heparin during and after major gynecologic surgery'. The document does not mention oral surgery or the position of the patient. However, it does mention that there was a statistically significant increase noted in fibrin degradation products in the group treated with 5,000 U heparin/12 hr as compared to the control group. This suggests that excessive bleeding during oral surgery might be related to coagulation disorders and the use of anticoagulant therapy. The document 'Oral anticoagulant therapy in patients undergoing dental surgery' mentions that an antifibrinolytic mouthwash containing tranexamic acid can effectively suppress postoperative bleeding. This suggests that excessive bleeding during oral surgery might be related to fibrinolysis and the use of antifibrinolytic agents. Therefore, I will look at the position choices and see if any of them are mentioned in the documents as a way to decrease excessive bleeding during oral surgery. None of the positions seem directly related to decreasing excessive bleeding during oral surgery.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
