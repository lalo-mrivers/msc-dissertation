["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for which scenario you would NOT perform a pulpectomy. The provided options are related to primary teeth. A pulpectomy is a surgical procedure to remove the pulp of a tooth. Therefore, we need to analyze each option and determine which one does not require a pulpectomy.\n\nOption A: Primary teeth with sinus tract - This could be an abscess or a cyst that requires drainage, but it may not necessarily require a pulpectomy.\n\nOption B: Primary teeth without successor - This means the tooth is not meant to develop further. In this case, a pulpectomy might still be necessary if the tooth is causing discomfort or infection.\n\nOption C: Primary teeth with furcation pathology - Furcation refers to the area where multiple roots of a multi-rooted tooth converge. Pathology in this area could indicate decay or inflammation that may require a pulpectomy.\n\nOption D: Pulpless primary teeth next to the line of a palatal cleft - This is an unusual scenario, but it seems that the tooth has already lost its pulp (is pulpless). In this case, there would be no need for a pulpectomy since the pulp is already missing.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
