["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the one measurement of fetal maturity that is not affected by a 'bloody tap' during amniocentesis. From the provided documents, it can be seen that L/S ratio (option A) and Phosphatidyl glycerol (option B) are mentioned as methods for assessing fetal lung maturity, but they may be affected by blood contamination.
