["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the type of flow that occurs when a material turns to liquid under critical shear stress. After reviewing the provided documents, it can be inferred that the material is an alginate aqueous system with different mannuronate/gluronate ratios and concentrations. The relevant document is 'influence of concentration and mannuronate/guluronate ratio on steady flow properties of alginate aqueous systems'. According to this document, the flow curves for the systems with the same molecular weight but different M/G ratios are congruent in the high shear rate region. This suggests that the material exhibits pseudoplastic behavior.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
