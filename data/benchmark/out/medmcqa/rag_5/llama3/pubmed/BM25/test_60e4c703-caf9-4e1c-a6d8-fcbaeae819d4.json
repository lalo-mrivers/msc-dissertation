["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the mechanism of skeletal muscle contraction. The relevant documents mention myofibers, muscle fibers, and fiber types. The first document discusses Duchenne muscular dystrophy, which is a degenerative disease affecting skeletal muscles. It does not provide information on muscle contraction mechanisms. The second document compares the muscle fibers of wheelchair athletes with Olympic athletes, but it does not relate to muscle contraction. The third document explores non-enzymatic glycosylation of myosin in diabetic and aged individuals, which is also not relevant to muscle contraction. The fourth document examines the sensitivity of different skeletal muscle fiber types to postischemic damage, but it does not discuss the mechanism of muscle contraction. Therefore, we can exclude all documents except for the original statement about Duchenne muscular dystrophy. According to this document, skeletal muscle degeneration was depicted as high signal intensity area reflecting its high fat contents, and these findings were more prominent toward myotendon junction than muscle bellies. This does not provide information on muscle contraction mechanisms either. Finally, we consider the general knowledge of muscle physiology that the sarcoplasmic reticulum plays a crucial role in muscle contraction by releasing calcium ions which bind to troponin, leading to muscle shortening. Therefore, option A is incorrect. Option B is correct as it describes the sliding filament theory of muscle contraction. Options C and D are also incorrect because they describe different steps in the muscle contraction process.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
