["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"At resting membrane potential, the respective equilibrium potentials of Xand Y are -30mV and -40mV. Since Z is blocked by the drug, its permeability is reduced. As a result, the membrane potential will shift towards the equilibrium potential of X (-30mV) because there is less influx of Z ions to counterbalance the outward flow of X ions. This will lead to depolarization.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
