["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Since the provided documents primarily discuss Apert syndrome's features, I will review each document to identify diagnostic features mentioned. The first document describes acne as a feature of Apert syndrome, but does not mention specific cranial or skeletal features. The second and third documents focus on birth prevalence and mortality rates, respectively, without describing diagnostic features. The fourth document discusses isotretinoin treatment for acne, but again does not describe diagnostic features. The fifth document details a case of atypical Apert syndrome with polydactyly, which suggests that complex syndactyly is a possible feature, but it does not provide definitive diagnostic criteria. In conclusion, the documents do not explicitly state that mandibular hypoplasia is a diagnostic feature of Apert syndrome.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
