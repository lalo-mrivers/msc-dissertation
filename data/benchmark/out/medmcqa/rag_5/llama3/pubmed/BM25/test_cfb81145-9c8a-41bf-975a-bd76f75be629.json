["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES) as a disease characterized by persistent peripheral blood and bone marrow eosinophilia. Therefore, the diagnosis of HES is based on elevated eosinophil count in the blood. The first document describes a patient with severe HES who had an initial blood eosinophil count that rapidly decreased to normal range after treatment with cyclosporine-A (CSA). The second document discusses the T-cell dependence of blood eosinophilia and suggests studying mechanisms of induction of persistent hypereosinophilia. The third document explores the central regulation of blood eosinophilia by the beta-adrenergic system in rats. The fourth document analyzes the role of IgE in intolerance to aspirin and tartrazine, but does not provide information specific to HES diagnosis. Therefore, we can infer that the diagnosis of HES is based on elevated eosinophil count in the blood.\", \"answer_choice\": C}"]
