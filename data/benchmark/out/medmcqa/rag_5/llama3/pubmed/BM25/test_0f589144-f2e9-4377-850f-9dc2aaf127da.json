["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents provide information on the effects of dialysis factors and route of administration on response to recombinant human erythropoietin. The document 'Whole blood viscosity in beta thalassemia minor' discusses the relationship between hematocrit (HCT) and whole blood viscosity. Since PRBC raises HCT, we can infer that one unit of PRBC increases HCT by a certain percentage. From this information, we can estimate the increase in HCT.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
