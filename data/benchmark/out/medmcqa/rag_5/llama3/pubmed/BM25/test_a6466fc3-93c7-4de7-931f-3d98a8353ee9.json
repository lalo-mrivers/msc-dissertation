["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Since the patient has Ewing's sarcoma, we know that this is a type of small round blue cell tumor. The relevant document 'Malignant peripheral neuroectodermal tumor and its necessary distinction from Ewing's sarcoma' mentions that Ewing's sarcoma does not have Homer-Wright rosettes or express neural markers like HNK-1 or S-100. Therefore, the diagnosis is confirmed as Ewing's sarcoma. The relevant document 'Undifferentiated small cell hepatoblastoma with a unique chromosomal translocation: a case report' shows that Ewing's sarcoma has a consistent cytogenetic abnormality, specifically t(11;22). This translocation was also detected in the patient's biopsy using FISH (Fluorescence In-Situ Hybridization) technique. Therefore, FISH is the best method to detect this translocation.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
