["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about N. gonorrhoea, which was isolated from 537 patients, i.e., 12.1 per cent of all cases. The documents provide information about different species and types of bacteria, but do not mention anything specific about the susceptibility to penicillin or axoregnic strains. Therefore, options B and C are likely to be incorrect.
