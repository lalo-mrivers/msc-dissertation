["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about a 12-year-old boy with a symmetric, expansile cystic lesion in the proximal humerus. The documents provided give information on various topics such as gymnasts' shoulder lesions, hemiarthroplasty for fractures of the proximal part of the humerus, megaureter, and cystic vaginal adenosis. However, none of these topics directly relate to the patient's condition or treatment options. Therefore, we need to look at the general information provided about fractures of the proximal part of the humerus. The documents describe a modular hemiarthroplasty for fractures, but do not mention anything specific about cystic lesions in the proximal humerus. Based on this information, we can rule out radiotherapy as an option because it is usually used to treat cancerous tumors and is not indicated for benign cystic lesions. We can also rule out intralesional steroids because they are not commonly used for treating cystic lesions of the bone. This leaves us with two options: curettage and intralesional sclerosing agents.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
