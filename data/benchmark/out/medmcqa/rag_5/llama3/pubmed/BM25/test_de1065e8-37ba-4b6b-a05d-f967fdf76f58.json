["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to the documents provided, MHC Class II antigens were detected on the bovine corpus luteum during the estrous cycle. Additionally, in cats experimentally infected with feline immunodeficiency virus, a significant elevation in the percentage of CD4+ and CD8+ T-lymphocytes expressing major histocompatibility complex (MHC) Class II antigens was observed. Furthermore, in immunohistochemical analysis of synovial membranes from inflammatory and non-inflammatory arthritides, CD4 positive T lymphocytes frequently expressed MHC Class II antigens and were found in sublining collections in close association with activated macrophages as well as B lymphocytes. In contrast, IL2 receptor (IL2r) expression on T cells and CD5 expression on B cells were rarely seen in these synovial membranes. Langerhans cells strongly express a 'nonconventional' Class I molecule, the CD1a antigen, but also express Class II MHC antigens. Finally, owl monkey peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) populations were characterized using monoclonal antibodies reactive with human and macaque lymphocyte antigens, including those reacting to MHC Class II DP-like, DR-like, and DQ-like molecules.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A: B-cells, dendritic cells and macrophages\""]
