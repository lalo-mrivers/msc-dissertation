The question asks for a specific type of curve that passes through the buccal and lingual cusp tips, but the relevant documents only discuss the anatomical relationship of the mandibular canal to its surrounding structures, the position of the maxillary artery in the infratemporal fossa, idiopathic bone cavities on the posterior buccal surface of the mandible, variations in bone mass within the cortices of the mandible, and the position of the mandibular canal in the edentulous jaw.
