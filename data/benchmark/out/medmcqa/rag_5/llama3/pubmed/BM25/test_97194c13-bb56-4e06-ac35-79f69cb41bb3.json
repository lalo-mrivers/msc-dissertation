["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the storage temperature of RBC, Platelet, and FFP. The relevant documents mention that frozen cartilage allografts have been used mostly for treatment of bone tumors which most often involve the subchondral and metaphyseal areas of the long bones, particularly around the knee and hip. This document does not provide information about blood storage temperature. However, we can look at the other documents provided. The first document mentions that Fresh Frozen Plasma (FFP) was used to treat patients with liver disease, or receiving coumadin, or undergoing coronary bypass surgery. It does not provide information about storage temperature. The third document provides information about plasma substitutes and their requirements, but it does not provide information about blood storage temperature. Finally, the last document is comparing the quality of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) with a virus-inactivated lyophilisated human pool-plasma (VFL). It does not provide information about blood storage temperature either.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
