["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant document is 'Mandibular osteosynthesis by miniature screwed plates via a buccal approach.' This describes the modified Michelet's technique for mandibular osteosynthesis. It states that this technique can be used in many types of mandibular fracture, except for fractures of the condylar neck and those with pre-existing infection. Infected fractures are treated by orthopaedic methods. The document does not mention infected mandibular angle fractures specifically. However, it also mentions another document 'The dynamics of the healing of an infected fracture of mandibular bone exposed to andekalin and kontrikal' which suggests that andecalin activated the exudative phase of inflammation and decelerated the proliferative processes. Therefore, we can infer that orthopaedic methods are used for treating infected fractures.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
