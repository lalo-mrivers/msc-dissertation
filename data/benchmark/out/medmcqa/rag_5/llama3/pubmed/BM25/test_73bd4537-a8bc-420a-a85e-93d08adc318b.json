["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the expansion of the contrast-filled space in myelography. Myelography is a technique used to visualize the spinal subarachnoid space after administration of a contrast medium. The documents provided discuss various aspects of myelography, including the use of metrizamide as a water-soluble contrast medium and its advantages over traditional oil-soluble contrast media. One of the documents discusses the expansion of an air-filled subdural space during nitrous oxide anesthesia. This is relevant to the question as it provides information on how a gas-filled space can expand. Therefore, I will look for a document that mentions expansion of a contrast-filled space in myelography.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
