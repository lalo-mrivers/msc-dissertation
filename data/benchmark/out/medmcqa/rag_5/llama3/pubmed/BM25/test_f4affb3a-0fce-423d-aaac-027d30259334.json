["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the conduction speed of A-alpha fibers. Looking at the provided documents, we can find the relevant information. In the document 'Apnea, tachypnea, and hypotension elicited by cardiac vagal afferents', it's mentioned that left ventricular vagal afferents altering respiration had conduction velocities between 22 and 70 m/s, whereas those causing hypotension had conduction velocities less than 22 m/s. The document also mentions that right ventricular vagal afferents causing both tachypnea and hypotension were less than 9 m/s. Since A-alpha fibers are involved in fast motor pathways, we can infer that their conduction speed is likely to be higher than those mentioned above. Therefore, the correct range for A-alpha fibers' conduction speed is between 70-120 m/s.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
