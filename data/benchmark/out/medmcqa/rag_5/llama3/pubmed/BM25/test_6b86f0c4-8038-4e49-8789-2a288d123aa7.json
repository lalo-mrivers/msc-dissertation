["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the ultrastructural localization of IgA deposits in dermal papilla. The relevant documents mention studies on immunoelectron microscopy, chronic bullous disease of childhood (CBDC), and electron microscopic studies in dermatitis herpetiformis. The document on CBDC mentions that IgA deposits were located chiefly below the lamina basalis (dermal type) but also, though less abundantly, in the lamina lucida, very much as we have seen them to be in adult cases with linear IgA immune deposits at the basement membrane zone. Similarly, the study on dermatitis herpetiformis mentions that ultrastructurally, the IgA deposits were located chiefly below the lamina basalis (dermal type) but also, though less abundantly, in the lamina lucida. Therefore, it can be inferred that IgA deposits in dermal papilla are characteristically seen in dermatitis herpetiformis.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
