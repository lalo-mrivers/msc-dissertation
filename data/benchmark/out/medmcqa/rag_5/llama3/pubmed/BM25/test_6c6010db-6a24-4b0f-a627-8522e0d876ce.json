["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The biological evaluation on glass ionomer cement compared the biological properties with those of zinc oxide-eugenol or polycarboxylate cement. The cytotoxicity test showed that the cells had a weaker reaction to the glass ionomer cement than the other two cements. This implies that the biocompatibility of the cements is similar, suggesting that the strength-giving component is likely not directly related to biological compatibility. The clinical studies compared the recall evaluation and caries incidence between restorations cemented with reinforced zinc oxide-eugenol cement and zinc phosphate cement. Since no significant differences were observed, it suggests that the strength-giving component of both cements is similar. The stress relaxation study compared the four temporary restoratives, including unmodified zinc oxide-eugenol cement, which showed more favorable relaxation characteristics than IRM and Cavit. This implies that the strength-giving component of zinc oxide-eugenol cement may be related to its relaxation properties. Finally, the leakage study comparing various types of luting agents showed that zinc oxide-eugenol cement is well suited for temporary cementation purposes, suggesting that its strength is suitable for this application.\", \"answer_choice\": B}"]
