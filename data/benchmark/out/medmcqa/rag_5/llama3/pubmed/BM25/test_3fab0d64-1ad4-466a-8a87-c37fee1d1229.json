["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about a 14-year-old male child presenting with abnormal body movements and MRI showing signal changes in various brain regions. The key features are corpus striatum, thalami, pons, medulla, centrum semiovale, and asymmetric diffuse white matter involvement. Comparing the given options, we can rule out nigrostriatal degeneration as it is typically seen in older adults. Parkinsonism might be possible but the asymmetric diffuse white matter involvement points towards a more specific diagnosis. Wilson's disease could be a possibility due to the presence of signal changes in the corpus striatum and thalami. Hallervorden-Spatz disease is known for its characteristic MRI features, which match what we see here.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
