["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"None of the options are primarily RNA-based techniques. Next generation sequencing is a type of DNA sequencing. PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) amplifies DNA or RNA, but it's not primarily an RNA-based technique. Sanger's technique is also a DNA sequencing method. Western blotting is a protein detection method that doesn't involve RNA directly. Therefore, none of the options match the description of being primarily RNA-based.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"None of the above (not A/B/C/D)\""]
