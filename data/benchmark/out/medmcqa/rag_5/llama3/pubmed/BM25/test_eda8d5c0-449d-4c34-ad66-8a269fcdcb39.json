["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents mention biotin's effects on various enzymes. In the first document, it increases the incorporation of precursors into nucleic acids. The second document suggests that biotin-induced loss of pregnancy may be due to blockage of estrogen production, which regulates endogenous progesterone secretion. The third document discusses the relationship between biotin and blood pyruvate carboxylase activity in chickens and turkeys. Finally, the fourth document describes the purification and properties of acetyl-coenzyme-A carboxylase from Candida lipolytica. Based on this information, we can infer that biotin affects enzymes involved in metabolism and protein synthesis.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
