["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking why asymptomatic Hep B is common in 2-3% of the normal population but there is an increased risk of transmission into hepatocellular carcinoma. Based on the provided documents, we know that chronic HBV infection is a major risk factor for HCC. The presence of anti-HCV antibodies is increased between 15 to 80% in all risk groups for HCV infection such as drug abuse, multiple transfusion, and haemodialysis. Moreover, there is evidence that HCV may be an oncogenic factor for hepatocellular carcinoma. It is present in 30 to 60% of the cases. This suggests that asymptomatic Hep B is a major risk factor for HCC.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
