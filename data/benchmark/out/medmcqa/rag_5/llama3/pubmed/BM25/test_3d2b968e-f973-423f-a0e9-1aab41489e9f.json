["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant document for this question is 'A study of digit fusion in the mouse embryo'. The study describes a true, though temporary, epithelial fusion during embryonic development. This phenomenon is also seen in lingual ridge formation. The passage states that displaced periderm cells form a prominent interdigital ridge, which remains until the periderm is shed. Similarly, a similar ridge of periderm cells is formed during the fusion of the eyelids and pinnae to the scalp. This suggests that the lingual ridge is also formed through epithelial fusion.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
