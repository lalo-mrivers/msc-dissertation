["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant document that provides information on the deformation of molar teeth during amalgam restorative procedures is 'An elementary study of deformation of molar teeth during amalgam restorative procedures'. This study used an optical comparator to examine the dimensional changes resulting from cavity preparation, application of the matrix and packing with amalgam in three extracted molar teeth. It did not specifically discuss the wedge technique for amalgam fillings. Therefore, we cannot rely solely on this document for our answer. The other documents provided are unrelated to the topic or do not provide information on the wedge technique.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: No wedge\""]
