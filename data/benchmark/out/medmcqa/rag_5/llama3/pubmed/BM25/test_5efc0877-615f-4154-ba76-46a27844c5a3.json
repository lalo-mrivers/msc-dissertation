["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents suggest that adrenaline is added to local anaesthetic solutions with a pronounced vasodilating effect to prolong the anaesthesia, reduce drug concentrations in the plasma, and negatively affect uterine contractions. This information implies that the concentration of adrenaline is important for achieving haemostasis and vasoconstriction at the surgical site. The documents also mention a pilot study where ultra-violet light caused the adrenaline levels to diminish rapidly, suggesting that storage conditions can impact adrenaline content. However, no specific concentration of adrenaline is mentioned in these documents.\",\n\"answer_choice\": A"]
