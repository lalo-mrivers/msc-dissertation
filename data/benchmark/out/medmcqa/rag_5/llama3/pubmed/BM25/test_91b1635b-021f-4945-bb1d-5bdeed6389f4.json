["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"In this question, we are looking for a characteristic of a left skewed curve. A left skewed curve is a distribution where the mode (the most frequent value) is on the right side of the mean and median. This means that the majority of the values in the distribution are smaller than the mode. In this case, the mean is less than the mode, so option B: Mean < Mode is the correct answer.\", \"answer_choice\": B}"]
