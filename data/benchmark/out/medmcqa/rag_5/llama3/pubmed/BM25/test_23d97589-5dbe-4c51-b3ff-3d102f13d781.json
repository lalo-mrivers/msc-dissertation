["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To find the number of pregnant women registered in a sub-center, we need to calculate the crude birth rate for that sub-center. Given that the crude birth rate is 20, this means that for every 100 women, there are 20 births. To find the number of pregnant women, we can use the formula: Number of Pregnant Women = Total Population / (Crude Birth Rate * 100). In this case, since the Crude Birth Rate is given as 20, we can plug in the values to get: Number of Pregnant Women = ? / (20 * 100). Since the question asks for the number of pregnant women registered in the sub-center, we know that the total population must be related to the registered pregnant women. Therefore, we can assume that the total population is equal to the number of registered pregnant women. Plugging in this value, we get: Number of Pregnant Women = Number of Registered Pregnant Women / (20 * 100). Solving for Number of Registered Pregnant Women, we get: Number of Registered Pregnant Women = Number of Pregnant Women * (20 * 100). Given that the Crude Birth Rate is 20, and we are looking for the number of registered pregnant women, we can set up the equation: 20 = ? / (20 * 100). Solving this equation, we get: ? = 100.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
