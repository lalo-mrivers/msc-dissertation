["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents mention the concept of apparent volume of distribution (V) being directly proportional to free fraction of drug in plasma (fp) and indirectly proportional to free fraction of drug in tissue (fT). If a drug has low apparent volume of distribution, it means that there is less distribution of the drug to tissues. This can be seen from the fact that the graph of V vs fp will have a lower slope.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
