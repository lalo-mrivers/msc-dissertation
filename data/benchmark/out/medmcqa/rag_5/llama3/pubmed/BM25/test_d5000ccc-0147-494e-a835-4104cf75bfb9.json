["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the muscle responsible for dislocation of the jaw. The relevant documents are related to the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) and its anatomy. From the documents, we can see that the articular disc displaces beyond the articular tubercle due to anterior disc displacement without reduction (ADDWOR). The document 'Innervation of the articular disc of the temporomandibular joint in guinea-pig Cavia cobaya (Rodentia - Mammalia)' states that occasional nerve fibers were observed next to blood vessels at the posterior inferior peripheral part of the articular disc. This suggests that the muscle responsible for dislocation is likely the lateral pterygoid muscle, which is known to be involved in jaw opening and closing movements.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
