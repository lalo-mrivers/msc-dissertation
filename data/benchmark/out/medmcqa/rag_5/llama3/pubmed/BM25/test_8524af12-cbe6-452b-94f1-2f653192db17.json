["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the blood supply of the maxilla after Le-Fort 1 osteotomy. From the provided documents, we can see that the Le-Fort I osteotomy is used for the treatment of cleft lip and palate, and that the arterial blood supply to the maxilla was demonstrated by selective carotid angiograms prior to the procedure. The document [A study of maxillary and mandibular vasculature in relation to orthognathic surgery] explains that the jaw bone's blood supply is characterized by centrifugal blood from alveolar arteries and centripetal blood from surrounding mucoperiosteum. After osteotomies, the moved bone segments are nourished only by attached mucoperiosteum. This suggests that the blood supply of the maxilla after Le-Fort 1 osteotomy is maintained by the centripetal blood from the surrounding mucoperiosteum.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
