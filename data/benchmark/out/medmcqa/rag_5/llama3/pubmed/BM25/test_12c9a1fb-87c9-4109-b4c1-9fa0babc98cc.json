["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the given documents, we can identify that ductus dependent cardiac defects are characterized by a flow-dependent on the patency of the ductus arteriosus. Based on this information, we can analyze each option to determine which ones would not be characterized by ductus dependent blood flow.\\n\\nOption A: Transposition of great arteries with intact septum - This is a complex congenital heart defect that is not directly related to the patency of the ductus arteriosus. Therefore, it would not be considered a ductus dependent cardiac defect.\\n\\nOption B: Interrupted aortic arch - An interrupted aortic arch can lead to ductus-dependent blood flow if there is significant dependence on the ductus for systemic blood flow.\\n\\nOption C: Truncus arteriosus - A truncus arteriosus would likely be characterized by ductus dependent blood flow as it would require patency of the ductus for adequate pulmonary and systemic blood flow.\\n\\nOption D: Hypoplastic left heart syndrome - This is a complex congenital heart defect that can lead to ductus-dependent blood flow if there is significant dependence on the ductus for pulmonary blood flow.\\n\\nBased on this analysis, option A (Transposition of great arteries with intact septum) would not be characterized by ductus dependent blood flow. Therefore, it is the correct answer.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
