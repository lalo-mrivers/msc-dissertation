["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the given documents, it's clear that loading dose is related to achieving a certain level or threshold of effectiveness. This concept is particularly relevant in the context of pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. The papers discuss the calculation of the loading dose necessary to reach a desired fraction of the asymptotic value of the amount of drug in a compartment receiving a constant rate infusion, as well as the relationship between loading dose and skin permeation rate. Considering these concepts, we can deduce that the major determinant of the loading dose is the Volume of distribution.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
