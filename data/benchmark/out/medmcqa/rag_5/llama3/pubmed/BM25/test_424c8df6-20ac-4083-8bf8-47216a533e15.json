["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the documents provided, we can identify two cements that hold well with the tooth. The first document mentions zinc phosphate cement (ZnPO4) and polycarboxylate cement as exhibiting a slight to moderate tendency to formation of slits at interfaces. In the second document, it is mentioned that the extent of slits was expressed as the length of all slits relative to the total length of the interface in each specimen. The results showed that ZnPO4 and polycarboxylate cement had a slight to moderate tendency to slit formation. Based on this information, we can infer that these two cements hold well with the tooth.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
