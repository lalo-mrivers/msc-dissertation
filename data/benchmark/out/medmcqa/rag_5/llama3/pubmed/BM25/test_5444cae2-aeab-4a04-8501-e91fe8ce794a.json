["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the action of proparacaine, which is an anesthetic eyedrop. We need to look for relevant information that tells us when its action starts. In the first document, 'The effect of corneal hypesthesia on the duration of proparacaine anesthetic eyedrops', we see that Cochet-Bonnet measurements were made in both eyes before and at 2- to 5-minute intervals after the instillation of one drop of 0.5% proparacaine until baseline corneal sensitivity levels were again achieved. This suggests that the action of proparacaine starts within 2 minutes.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
