["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Since the given documents describe developmental characteristics in 3-year-olds, we can compare the options to see if they match any milestones mentioned. The documents state that there were no significant differences between children who achieved developmental milestones at different ages, nor in any of the developmental characteristics assessed. Therefore, we should look for a milestone not mentioned as being achieved by the children in the study. Among the options, 'Hopping on one leg', 'Drawing square', and 'Feeding by spoon' seem to be reasonable milestones that might be expected in 3-year-olds. On the other hand, 'Catching a ball reliably' seems more challenging for this age group.
