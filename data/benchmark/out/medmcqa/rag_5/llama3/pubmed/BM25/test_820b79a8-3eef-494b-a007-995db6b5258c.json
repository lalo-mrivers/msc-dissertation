["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the question, we know that LA blockade refers to injury discharge, which plays a role in triggering autotomy. The provided documents mention C fibers as having primary afferent depolarization susceptible to presynaptic control by segmental and suprasegmental mechanisms. This suggests that C fibers may be influenced by LA blockade. On the other hand, A alpha, A beta, and B fibers are not mentioned in relation to injury discharge or autotomy. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that among the given options, C fibers are the nerve fiber type least susceptible to LA blockade.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
