["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The document 'Cusp size, sexual dimorphism, and heritability of cusp size in twins' describes the size hierarchy of primary and permanent mandibular molar cusps. According to this study, the protoconid, entoconid, and metaconid are the largest of the mandibular molar cusps. The smallest cusp is not explicitly mentioned in the document. However, based on the description of the size hierarchy, it can be inferred that the smallest cusp is likely to be one of the smaller cusps such as the distobuccal or mesial cusp.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A: Distobuccal\""]
