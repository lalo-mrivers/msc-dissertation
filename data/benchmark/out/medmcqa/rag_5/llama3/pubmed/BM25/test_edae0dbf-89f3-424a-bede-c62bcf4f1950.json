["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents provided deal with Coxsackie virus infections in newborn infants, mice, and other animals. In the first document, it is mentioned that the virus was isolated from the faeces of ward personnel and serological evidence of recent infection was found by means of the CFT. This suggests that humans can be infected by Coxsackie viruses. The second document describes experimental Coxsackie virus B-3 and B-4 myocarditis in mice, which shows that Coxsackie viruses can cause heart problems in animals. The third document discusses serological diagnosis of Coxsackie virus infections in newborn period using acetate foil electrophoresis, where it is mentioned that the virus was observed to be fresh in 16 sera, with more than 50% of these sera showing an abnormally high level of IgM. This suggests that Coxsackie viruses can cause recent infections in humans. The fourth document describes the pathology of Coxsackie virus B4 infection in a murine model and detects virus-specific RNA in the pancreas by in situ hybridisation. This shows that Coxsackie viruses can cause pancreatic problems in animals. Based on these findings, we can infer that Coxsackie viruses are capable of causing infections in various parts of the human body, including the heart and pancreas.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
