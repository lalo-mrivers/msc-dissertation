["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Since we are looking at a skeletal Class III, we need to analyze the relevant documents. The cranial base flexure (BaSN angle) was more obtuse in Class II, and the posterior cranial base angle (SBaN) was more acute (P less than 0.01). These variations co-existed with a more retruded position of the condylar neck in the face (P less than 0.01) favouring per se a post-normal relationship of the mandible to the maxilla. This suggests that Class II is characterized by an increased flexure and a more acute posterior cranial base angle, which affects the ANB angle.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
