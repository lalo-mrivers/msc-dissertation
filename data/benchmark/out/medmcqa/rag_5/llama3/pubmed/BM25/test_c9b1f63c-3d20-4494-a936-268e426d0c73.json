["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents are studies on radionuclide ventriculography (RVG) for assessing left ventricular function. One study describes the advantages of using a combination of LAO and LPO views in RVG, which suggests that bit depth is not measured in terms of bits (digital or analog), but rather as an anatomical perspective. Another study compares RVG with conventional radiography for working length estimation in root canal treatment. These studies do not provide information on bit depth. The only mention of 'bit' is in the context of a broken drill bit in an orthopaedic surgery procedure, which has no relation to digital or analog data.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
