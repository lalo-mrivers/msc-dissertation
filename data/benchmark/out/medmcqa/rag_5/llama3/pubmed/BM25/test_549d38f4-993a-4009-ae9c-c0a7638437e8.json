["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents provide information on root canal filling materials for primary teeth and endodontic therapy. The ideal depth of MTA (mineral trioxide aggregate) for root end filling material is not explicitly mentioned in the provided documents. However, we can draw some insights from the literature. In general, it is recommended to fill the root canal to the dentine-cemental junction (approx. 1 mm short of the apex) in vital cases and to the apical foramen in necrotic cases. This suggests that a shallow depth may be ideal for MTA filling material.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
