["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the role of Golgi tendon organ during voluntary movements. According to the provided documents, particularly 'Mechanical transduction in the Golgi tendon organ: a hypothesis' and 'Tendon organs of cat medial gastrocnemius: responses to active and passive forces as a function of muscle length', it is mentioned that force applied to a muscle's tendon will straighten collagen braids and cause compressional deformation of axon branches trapped between them. This suggests that the Golgi tendon organ functions as a biological force transducer under static loading conditions. In the context of voluntary movements, this means that the Golgi tendon organ would continuously relay information about the tension in the muscle to efferent neurons.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
