["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the preferred headgear for treating a Class II div. 1 malocclusion with a horizontal growth trend. The relevant documents discuss different types of headgears and their effects on facial growth. Based on the information provided, it can be inferred that the activator-headgear combination used in the treatment of skeletal Class II correction aims at correcting the malocclusion without diverting the anterior landmarks of the bony face from their specific lines of growth. The document also states that the corrective effect of this appliance may be assumed to be the result of several different factors, including restraining the maxillary dentition in a posterior cranial direction, influencing the mandibular dentition in an anterior downward direction, and preventing transfer of distally directed headgear forces from the maxilla to the mandible. Considering these effects, it can be concluded that a high pull head gear is preferred while treating a Class II div. 1 malocclusion with a horizontal growth trend.\",\n\"answer_choice\": A"]
