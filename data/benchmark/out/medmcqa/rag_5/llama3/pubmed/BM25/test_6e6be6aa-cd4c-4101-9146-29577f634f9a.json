["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 34-year-old primigravida at 11 weeks gestation with exposure to a rash. The husband has broken out on a rash consisting of grouped vesicles on a maculopapular base, which is indicative of varicella zoster virus (VZV) infection. Since the patient's HIV test is negative and she does not show any symptoms of VZV infection, it can be concluded that the husband has transmitted the infection to her. The patient is not infected with VZV, but may have been exposed. Therefore, it is crucial to prevent transmission to the fetus. Varicella immunoglobulin is effective in preventing congenital varicella syndrome when administered within 72 hours of exposure. Since the patient has already been exposed, administering varicellase immunoglobulin to the infant at birth would be too late. The next step would be to administer varicella immunoglobulin to the patient now to prevent transmission to the fetus.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
