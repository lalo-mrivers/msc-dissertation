["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks where pericytes are found. We can look at the given documents for information about pericyte localization. In the first document, 'Pericyte involvement in capillary sprouting during angiogenesis in situ', it is mentioned that pericytes were regularly found lying at and in front of the advancing tips of endothelial sprouts, suggesting their association with capillaries. The second document, 'Ultrastructural study of pericytes in the rat supraoptic nucleus', describes pericytes as being surrounded by basal membrane and having cytoplasmic processes, which could be indicative of their localization around capillaries or blood vessels. The third and fourth documents do not provide direct information about pericyte localization, but do mention pericytes' association with capillaries in the context of angiogenesis and wound healing. Therefore, based on the provided information, it is reasonable to conclude that pericytes are found around capillaries.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
