["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the type of pin used in a root canal treated tooth. After reviewing the relevant documents, we can see that [Experimental horizontal fractures of front tooth roots and their endodontic endosseous pin fixation in monkeys] mentions 'endodontal bone pins', which are likely cemented pins. [Endodontic-endosseal fixation and capping pin] also discusses a 'fixing and capping pin' which seems to be the same type of pin mentioned earlier. Additionally, [Conservative approach to the placement of retentive pins] talks about the use of rubber dams for isolation procedures, suggesting that cemented pins might be used to ensure proper fixation. Therefore, it is likely that a Cemented pin is used in this case.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
