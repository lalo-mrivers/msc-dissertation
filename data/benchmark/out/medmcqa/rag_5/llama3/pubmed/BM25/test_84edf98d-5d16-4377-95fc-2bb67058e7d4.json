["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the reaction that occurs when horse serum is injected intravenously into a rabbit and again into the skin two or three weeks later. Since the first injection was intravenous and the second was cutaneous, we can rule out anaphylaxis as it typically requires both antigenic challenge and mast cell activation. Atopy is not relevant in this context. Arthus phenomenon is characterized by the formation of a local inflammatory reaction at the site of the second injection, which matches our description. Serum sickness is also a possibility, but since we are dealing with horse serum, which contains antibodies, it's more likely that the reaction is due to the immune response.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
