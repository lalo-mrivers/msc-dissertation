["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Stiffness is calculated as the slope of the force-elongation curve (from the first document), which represents resistance to elastic deformation. The same concept can be seen in the calculation of stiffness gradient along the basilar membrane, where it's used to determine spatial frequency analysis within the cochlea (from the third document). Additionally, stiffness is mentioned as an important factor in assessing arm and hand function after treatment of breast cancer (from the fourth document), where it represents resistance to elastic deformation. Lastly, from the second document, we can see that stiffness refers to the tensile strength characteristics of fascia lata sutures obtained from the same cadaver, which also represents resistance to elastic deformation.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
