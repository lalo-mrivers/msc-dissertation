["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents do not mention the depth of lingual fossa in specific types of incisors. However, we can analyze the documents for any information about the lingual fossa depth. The first document mentions that no significant difference was found between left and right incisors, except for directional asymmetry in female centrals. This does not provide information about the most prominent lingual fossa in specific types of incisors. The second document is a histological study of human lingual tonsil and does not mention anything about the depth of lingual fossa in incisors. The third document is about posterior fossa intracranial hemorrhage and does not provide any information about lingual fossa depth. Therefore, we cannot find any information that directly answers this question.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
