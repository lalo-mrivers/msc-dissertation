["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The provided documents describe various surgical procedures for treating cysts of the spleen and jaw. Odontogenic keratocysts are mentioned as being locally destructive and having a high potential for recurrence after conservative surgical treatment. Marsupialisation is mentioned as a conservative procedure used to treat echinococcosis cysts in the spleen, while enucleation is also described as a method used to treat liver echinococcus. The Lectin histochemistry of cystic jaw lesions suggests that marsupialisation could be a useful procedure for treating odontogenic keratocysts. Computed tomography of odontogenic keratocysts highlights the importance of determining the extent and involvement of the teeth in surgical planning. Anatomo-radiological evaluation of long term results of surgery of large odontogenic cysts suggests that marsupialisation could be a useful procedure for treating large odontogenic cysts with mandibular localization. Therefore, considering these documents, the expected surgical procedure most frequently indicated for odontogenic cysts is likely to be Marsupialisation.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
