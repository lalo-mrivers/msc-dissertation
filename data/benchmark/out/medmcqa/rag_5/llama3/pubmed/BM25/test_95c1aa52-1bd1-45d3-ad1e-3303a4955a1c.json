["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant document for this question is 'Cytomegalovirus infection: congenital and neonatal disease'. According to the document, CMV infection can affect up to 40% of infected infants. Since the lady has developed chickenpox, which is a herpesvirus that can cause CMV infection in pregnant women, we need to determine when this would lead to the highest chance of neonatal infection. The document states that 'About 5% of the infected infants will have manifestations of CMV infection in the newborn period and the prognosis for this group is poor.' This suggests that the risk of neonatal infection is higher if the mother acquires CMV during late pregnancy. Therefore, the highest chance of neonatal infection would be during the last 5 days of pregnancy.\",\n\"answer_choice\": A"]
