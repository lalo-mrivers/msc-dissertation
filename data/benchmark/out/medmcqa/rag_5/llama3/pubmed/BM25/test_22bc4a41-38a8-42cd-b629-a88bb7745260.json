["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents discuss various aspects of endometriosis, including diagnosis, histology, and treatment. We can infer that the question is related to the histological appearance of endometriotic lesions. Upon reviewing the case of spontaneous endometriosis in a macaque diagnosed by nuclear magnetic resonance imaging, we see that postmortem histology was obtained. The histology showed a variety of endometriotic lesions, including extrauterine hyperintense apparently cystic regions, extrauterine hypointensive regions apparently associated with intracellular paramagnetic iron proteins, and an enlarged myometrium exhibiting adenomyosis foci. This suggests that the histological appearance of endometriotic lesions can be heterogeneous.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
