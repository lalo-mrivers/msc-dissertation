["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents provided discuss various types of tumors and sinus-related issues. However, none of them specifically mention angiofibroma or its classification stages for extension to one or more paranasal sinuses. Therefore, we cannot directly find the answer in the given documents. The question is not related to ossifying fibroma as mentioned in the first document, which affects the mid-face and paranasal sinuses differently than its mandibular counterpart. Similarly, the other documents discuss various aspects of paranasal sinuses like radiologic anatomy, densitometric studies, or invasive aspergillosis, but do not provide information on angiofibroma's stage classification for sinus extension. As a result, we cannot determine the correct answer from the provided options.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
