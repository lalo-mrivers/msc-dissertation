["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The document that talks about migration of odontoblasts into dentinal tubules is Studies on dentin 2. transient vasodentin in the incisor teeth of a rodent (perognathus longimembris). The text states 'Vascular inclusions regularly occur in the lingual dentin of the constantly erupting teeth of the pocket mouse (P. longimembris). The inclusion of a capillary loop and surrounding perivascular tissues is associated with odontoblasts whose cytodifferentiation is relatively immature.' This suggests that the migration of odontoblasts into dentinal tubules occurs during the process of vasodentinogenesis, which is related to lower stages of odontoblastic cytodifferentiation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
