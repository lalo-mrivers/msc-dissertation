["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the mechanism of periapical bone resorption. The provided documents describe the role of IL-1 beta in mediating bone resorption. Specifically, IL-1 beta is produced by monocytes and macrophages and is involved in modulating bone cell activity. The study on IL-1 beta detection in human periapical lesions showed that periapical samples exhibited significant activity of IL-1 beta, whereas normal pulp had no activity. This suggests that IL-1 beta is produced and released locally in inflammatory periapical lesions to mediate bone resorption.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
