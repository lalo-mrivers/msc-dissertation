["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"We are looking for a G-protein coupled receptor that does not act through opening of potassium channels. From the provided documents, we can see that opioids act on mu-receptors to increase the opening of inwardly rectifying potassium channels, thus leading to hyperpolarisation. This suggests that mu-receptors do act through opening of potassium channels. We also know that agonists specific for other receptors, such as alpha 2- and somatostatin-receptors, are capable of opening the same population of potassium channels on LC neurons. Therefore, we can rule out these receptors. We are left with options A, B, C, and D. The question states that the receptor does not act through opening of potassium channels, which suggests that it may be involved in other physiological processes. Options A, B, C, and D all correspond to G-protein coupled receptors that can affect various cellular processes, but do not necessarily involve the opening of potassium channels.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
