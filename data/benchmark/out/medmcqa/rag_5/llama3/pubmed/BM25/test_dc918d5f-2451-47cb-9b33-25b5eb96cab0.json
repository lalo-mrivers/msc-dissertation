["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the transmission of cardiac pain to the jaw. The relevant documents discuss various nerves related to the face and jaw muscles. The 5th cranial nerve (trigeminal nerve) is responsible for transmitting sensory information from the face, including the jaw. The third cervical nerve (C3) and first thoracic nerve (T1) are involved in transmitting pain signals from the chest area to other parts of the body. Similarly, the 7th cranial nerve (facial nerve) is responsible for controlling facial movements. Based on this information, it can be inferred that cardiac pain may be transmitted to the jaw due to the overlapping of nerves.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
