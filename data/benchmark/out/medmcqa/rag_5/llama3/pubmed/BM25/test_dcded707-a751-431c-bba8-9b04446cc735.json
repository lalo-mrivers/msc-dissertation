["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the detachment of myosin head from actin. From the given documents, we can see that the structural mechanism by which myosin heads exert force is unknown (MgATP binding changes neither the shape nor the flexibility of the heads). One possibility is that the tight binding of the heads to actin drives them into a force-generating configuration. Another possibility is that the force-generating conformational change is inherent to the myosin heads. The study on regulatory light chain influences alterations of myosin head induced by actin suggests that both phosphorylation and cation exchange influence the effect of actin binding on the structural organization of myosin head.\n\nCrossbridge states in isometrically contracting fish muscle: evidence for swinging of myosin heads on actin shows that time-resolved X-ray diffraction studies reveal a non-force producing 'weak-binding' state, where myosin heads bind to actin in a non-specific manner. This study does not directly address the detachment of myosin head from actin. Therefore, we cannot conclude that one of the options (A, B, C, or D) is the correct answer based on these documents.\n\nHowever, we can consider the general process of muscle contraction and relaxation. The hydrolysis of an ATP molecule is assumed to produce the excitation of hydrogen bonds between electronegative atoms in the myosin head and actin filament. This excitation energy generates a tractive force that makes the atoms approach each other. The swing of the myosin head results in macroscopic mutual displacement of actin and myosin polymers.\n\nBased on this mechanism, it can be inferred that detachment of myosin head from actin is caused by the release of ADP and Pi (D), as these molecules are products of ATP hydrolysis. The binding of ATP (C) actually leads to the excitation of hydrogen bonds between electronegative atoms in the myosin head and actin filament, which drives the contraction process.\n\nTherefore, option D is the most likely answer.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
