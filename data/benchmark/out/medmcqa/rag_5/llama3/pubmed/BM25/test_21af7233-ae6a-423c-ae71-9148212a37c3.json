["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the mechanism of muscle contraction. Calcium ions trigger muscle contraction by binding to regulatory proteins that allow interaction of actin and myosin. Two different regulatory systems are found in different muscles: actin-linked regulation, where troponin and tropomyosin regulate actin, and myosin-linked regulation, where sites on myosin are blocked in the absence of calcium.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
