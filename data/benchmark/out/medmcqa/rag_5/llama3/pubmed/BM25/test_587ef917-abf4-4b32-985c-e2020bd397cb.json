["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Anaerobic glycolysis is the process of glucose breakdown without using oxygen. It produces ATP, but the question asks about how many ATPs are produced per unit glucose consumed. The relevant documents mention that anaerobic glycolysis produces lactate, ATP, and water, but there is no net change in the number of hydrogen ions. Hydrolysis of ATP with release of hydrogen ions causes acidosis associated with hyperlactataemia.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
