["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the table provided, it can be observed that the new drug treated group shows an increase in heart rate, a decrease in systolic blood pressure, and an increase in diastolic blood pressure. Additionally, tremors are present in the new drug treated group but not in the placebo treated group. This suggests that the new drug is likely to have a sympathomimetic effect, increasing cardiac activity and causing vasodilation. This is consistent with the actions of alpha-1 agonists and beta-2 agonists.\n\nVerapamil, as described in 'Verapamil and the Heart', has similar effects on heart rate, blood pressure, and arrhythmias. The text also mentions that verapamil can cause tremors. Given these similarities, it is likely that the new drug is an alpha-1 antagonist and beta-2 agonist, which are properties of Verapamil.\n\nIn 'An Industrial Approach to Drug Discovery', close collaboration between biologists and medicinal chemists is mentioned as a proven way to discover new products. This suggests that the new drug may have been discovered using a similar approach.\n\nFinally, in 'Bioavailability of Imipramine Tablets Relative to a Stable Isotope-Labeled Internal Standard', it is noted that advances in drug therapy come from applying new technologies and leading-edge science, perhaps in collaboration with academia. This further supports the idea that the new drug was developed using a collaborative approach.\n\nTherefore, based on these findings, it is likely that the new drug is an alpha-1 antagonist and beta-2 agonist, which are properties of Verapamil.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
