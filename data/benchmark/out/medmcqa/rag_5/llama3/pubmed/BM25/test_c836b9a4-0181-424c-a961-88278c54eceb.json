["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents discuss base metal alloys, but none of them specifically mention the cleaning process. However, we can analyze the chemical composition of the alloys mentioned. Nickel, chromium, and beryllium are mentioned as constituents of some alloys. HCl is an acid commonly used to clean metal surfaces, while HF and H2SO4 are also acids that could potentially be used for cleaning. Sandblasting with aluminum oxide is a mechanical method for surface finishing, not chemical cleaning. Based on this analysis, we can infer that the correct answer involves acid-based cleaning.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
