["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about effective strategies to decrease the risk of post-puncture dural headache. From the provided documents, we can infer that Sprotte needles have a non-cutting tip and Quincke needles have a cutting bevel. The study comparing Sprotte and Quincke needles found that Sprotte needles caused similar post-dural puncture headache rates to Quincke needles with the bevel parallel to the dural fibers. Another study found that the incidence of post-dural puncture headache was higher when using Quincke needles with the needle bevel inserted perpendicular to the dural fibers.\n\nWe can also infer that subarachnoid morphine did not decrease the incidence of post-dural puncture headache, and epidural blood patches can treat post-dural puncture headaches. Finally, a study found that the incidence of PDPH was lower when using Sprotte spinal needles compared to Quincke cutting-tip needles.\n\nTherefore, effective strategies to decrease the risk of post-puncture dural headache are using small bore needle, supplementation of fluids, and replacement of stylet prior to removal of needle.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
