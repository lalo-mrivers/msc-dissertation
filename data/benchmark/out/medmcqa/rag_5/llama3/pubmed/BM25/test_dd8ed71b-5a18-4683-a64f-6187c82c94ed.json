["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the best distribution to study the daily admission of head injury patients in a trauma care centre. The relevant documents discuss the epidemiology of head injuries, including incidence rates and patterns of death from trauma. Based on these findings, we can conclude that the number of daily admissions is likely to be a Poisson-distributed random variable. This is because the studies mention incidence rates per 100,000 inhabitants, which suggests a countable event with a high probability of rare events (head injuries). Additionally, the Uniform distribution does not seem relevant as it would require all possible outcomes to have an equal probability, whereas in this case, some outcomes (e.g., no head injury) are more likely than others. The Normal and Binomial distributions can be ruled out since they require continuous or binary outcomes, respectively, which is not the case here.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
