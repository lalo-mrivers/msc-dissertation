["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the most common gene defect in idiopathic steroid resistant nephrotic syndrome. From the given documents, we can infer that there are two types of familial nephrotic syndrome: one with focal-segmental glomerulosclerosis and another with minimal-change nephrotic syndrome. The second type responds well to steroid and immunosuppressant therapy, while the first type is resistant. Based on this information, we can conclude that the gene defect causing idiopathic steroid resistant nephrotic syndrome might be related to the focal-segmental glomerulosclerosis subtype.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
