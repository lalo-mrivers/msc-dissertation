["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about a non-invasive method to measure blood flow. The relevant documents mention several methods: electromagnetic measurement of peripheral pulsatile blood flow, 81Rb/81mKr ratio for measuring kidney blood flow, and others. The electromagnetic measurement method described in the first document uses Faraday's law to detect the blood flow rate induced by a magnetic field. This is different from the other methods which use radioactive tracers or ultrasound. Therefore, based on this information, I conclude that the answer is related to the electromagnetic measurement method.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
