["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the trigger for myosin head detachment from actin. The relevant documents discuss different regulatory systems in muscles, including calcium regulation of muscle contraction. Calcium triggers contraction by reacting with regulatory proteins that prevent interaction between actin and myosin. Myosin regulation is controlled by a regulatory subunit that can be dissociated reversibly by removing divalent cations with EDTA. This suggests that calcium plays a key role in regulating myosin activity.\n\nThe document on temperature-dependence of tension development by glycerinated muscle fibers also mentions the formation of the myosin-product complex during Mn(II)-ATP hydrolysis, which is different from the usual ATPase activity. This implies that there are different states of myosin activity that can be triggered or altered by various factors.\n\nGiven this information, it seems that myosin head detachment from actin may be triggered by changes in calcium levels or other regulatory factors rather than purely by biochemical reactions.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
