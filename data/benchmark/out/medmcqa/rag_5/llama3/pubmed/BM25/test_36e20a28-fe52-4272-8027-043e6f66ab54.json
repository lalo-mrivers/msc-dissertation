["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about hand to knee gait in polio. The relevant document is 'The location of the polio genome protein in viral RNAs and its implication for RNA synthesis'. This document does not mention anything about muscle involvement in gait. However, another relevant document 'Mechanism of production of gait unsteadiness by tumours in the posterior fossa' mentions truncal ataxia which is unrelated to the question. The remaining documents 'The control of genu recurvatum by combining the Swedish knee-cage and an ankle-foot brace', 'Against relative timing invariance in movement kinematics', and 'Knee arthrodesis: long-term results' do not provide any information about hand to knee gait in polio either. Therefore, we need to rely on the general knowledge of poliomyelitis. According to various medical sources, poliomyelitis often affects the muscles of the lower extremities including quadriceps and hamstrings leading to gait abnormalities.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: Hamstring\""]
