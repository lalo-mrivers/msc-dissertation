["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about isolated aoic stenoses. We need to identify which option is NOT true for this condition. From the provided documents, we can see that there is no direct information about isolated aoic stenoses. However, we can infer some information from other parts of the text. For example, we know that pulsus bisferiens (option A) is a characteristic feature of aoic stenosis, and it is not specific to isolated aoic stenoses. Similarly, cardiac apex being displaced laterally to left (option B) and thrill in carotid artery (option C) are also features of aoic stenosis, but they do not specifically relate to isolated aoic stenoses. The only option that seems to be directly related to the condition is 'Blood pressure maintained in initial phase' which is true for aoic stenosis as it can cause blood pressure to rise initially.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
