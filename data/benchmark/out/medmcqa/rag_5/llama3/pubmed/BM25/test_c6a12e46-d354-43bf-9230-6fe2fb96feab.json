["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the rapid onset of action seen by local anesthesia in small nerve endings. The relevant document that discusses this topic is [Molecular mechanism of inhibition of firefly luminescence by local anesthetics]. This document explains that clinical concentrations of local anesthetics inhibit ATP-induced luminescence in a dose-dependent manner, and that the predominant cause of this inhibition is hydrophobic ligand-enzyme interaction. However, hydrophilic interaction also contributes to the inhibition to a lesser degree. The document also outlines a molecular theory of anesthesia, which postulates that release of electrostricted water molecules from the hydrophilic parts of the enzyme due to protein conformational changes induced by anesthetics is the cause of decreased luminescence.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
