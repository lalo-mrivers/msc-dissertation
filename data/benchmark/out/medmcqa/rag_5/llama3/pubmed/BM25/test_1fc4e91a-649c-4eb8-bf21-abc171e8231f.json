["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The study 'Total leukocyte and neutrophil count changes associated with antenatal betamethasone administration in premature infants' shows an increase in neutrophil and immature neutrophil forms when the drug was administered to the mother close to delivery. This effect lasted for three days. Afterwards, although the counts were not significantly high compared to the control group, their physiological decrease was delayed. The same study indicates that antenatal maternal administration of betamethasone as a cause of leukemoid reaction or leukocytosis after birth. Other studies like 'Prophylactic procedures to prevent respiratory distress syndrome in prematures' and '[Prevention of respiratory distress Syndrome with Betamethasone]' show the beneficial effects of betamethasone on fetal lung maturation and mortality rate. However, none of these studies mention anything about prevention of hyperbilirubinemia or intraventricular hemorrhage.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
