["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the arch space for eruption of 2nd & 3rd molar. We need to find a document that mentions this topic. The documents provided are related to dental and orthodontic topics, so let's look at the first document: A longitudinal study on the effect of unilateral extraction of primary molars. This document talks about space conditions, need for orthodontic treatment, and eruption stage of permanent canines and second molars. We can see that the study investigated the space on the extraction side compared to the control side. This gives us a hint that the arch space might be related to the extraction of primary molars. Let's look at the third document: The effect of early loss of primary molars on tooth eruption and space conditions. This document is directly related to our topic. It talks about the space conditions after early loss of primary molars. Specifically, it mentions that children with loss of primary molars before 7 1/2 years developed more crowding than children without losses.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
