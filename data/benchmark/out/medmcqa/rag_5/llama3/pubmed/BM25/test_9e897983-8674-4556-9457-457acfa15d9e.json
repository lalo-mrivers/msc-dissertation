["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The given mean haemoglobin level is 10.6 g/dL, and the standard deviation is 2 g/dL. To find the minimum haemoglobin level below which 5% of the pregnant females will have their haemoglobin levels, we need to calculate the z-score for a cumulative proportion of 0.95 (1 - 0.05). The z-score can be calculated using the standard normal distribution table or a calculator. Let's assume the mean is μ = 10.6 and the standard deviation is σ = 2. Using the formula (x - μ) / σ, we get (x - 10.6) / 2. Then, using the z-table or a calculator, we find that for a cumulative proportion of 0.95, the corresponding z-score is approximately -1.645. Now, multiply this value by the standard deviation (σ = 2) and add it to the mean (μ = 10.6): x ≈ 10.6 + (-1.645 * 2). This gives us the minimum haemoglobin level below which 5% of the pregnant females will have their haemoglobin levels.\",\n\"answer_choice\": A"]
