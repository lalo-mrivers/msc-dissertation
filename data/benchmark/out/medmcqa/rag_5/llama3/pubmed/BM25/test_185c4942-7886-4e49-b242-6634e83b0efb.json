["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Post-translational modifications refer to changes that occur to a protein after its translation from DNA into amino acid sequence. The provided documents do not mention selenocysteine, triiodothyronine, or tryptophan as undergoing post-translational modification. Hydroxyproline and hydroxylysine are both modified amino acids found in proteins. Selenocysteine is a rare amino acid that can be incorporated into proteins through a post-translational process called selenylation, but it does not undergo classical post-translational modifications.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
