["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To find the answer, we need to first calculate the 1st and 3rd quartiles. The given values are 94 mm Hg for the 1st quartile and 110 mm Hg for the 3rd quartile. This means that 25% of the patients have a blood pressure below 94 mm Hg, 75% have a blood pressure below 110 mm Hg, and 50% are between these two values. To find the 4th quartile (i.e., the upper limit for 25% of the patients), we need to calculate the interquartile range (IQR). Since the IQR is half the difference between the 3rd and 1st quartiles, it would be (110 - 94) / 2 = 8 mm Hg. Adding this value to the 3rd quartile gives us the 4th quartile: 110 + 8 = 118 mm Hg. Now we can find the number of patients with blood pressures between the 3rd and 4th quartiles by subtracting the proportion of patients with blood pressure below the 3rd quartile from 100 (since all 200 patients are above 94 mm Hg). This gives us: 75% - 25% = 50%. Therefore, half of the 200 patients, or 100, have blood pressures between the 3rd and 4th quartiles.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
