["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about markers of acute kidney injury. The relevant documents discuss various enzymes' activities in serum, including LAP, CE, APh, SPh, and guanase. These enzymes' activities were studied in relation to acute renal failure and shock. From these studies, we can infer that enzymes like APh, SPh, and CE are involved in kidney injury, while LAP and guanase do not change. Therefore, markers of acute kidney injury include those enzymes' activities.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
