["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents discuss heat exchange processes in human airways, lyophilization of pharmaceutical injections, and protein-water interactions. The question refers to the amount of heat required to change boiling water into vapor, which is related to the concept of latent heat. Upon reviewing the documents, I found that the concept of latent heat is mentioned in the document 'Protein--water interactions. Heat capacity of the lysozyme--water system.' Specifically, the document discusses the heat capacity of the lysozyme-water system and mentions the partial specific heat capacity of the protein in dilute solution as 1.483 +/- 0.009 J K-1 g-1, which is close to the value for ice. This suggests that the concept of latent heat is relevant to understanding the heat exchange processes involved.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
