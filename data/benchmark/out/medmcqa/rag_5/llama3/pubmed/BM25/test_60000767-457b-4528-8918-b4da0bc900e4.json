["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the document 'New information on high copper amalgam corrosion', we know that Cu6Sn5 is found to be passive in nearly neutral synthetic saliva. This means that anodic corrosion activity previously reported for a high copper amalgam must result from the presence of the gamma2 phase or tin in the matrix phase. There is no mention of compressive strength, marginal breakdown, or creep, which rules out options A, B, and D.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
