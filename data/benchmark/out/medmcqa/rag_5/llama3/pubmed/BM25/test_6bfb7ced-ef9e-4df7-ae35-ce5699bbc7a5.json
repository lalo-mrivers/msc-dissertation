["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about an intermediate filament that is NOT monomeric. We can rule out the answer choices by looking at their characteristics. Vimentin and desmin are both intermediate filaments that have a tendency to form polymers, but they do not typically exist as monomers. Keratin is also an intermediate filament, but it often forms dimers or higher-order structures. Tubulin, on the other hand, is a component of microtubules and exists primarily as a dimer or polymer. Based on this information, we can conclude that the correct answer is not a monomeric intermediate filament.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
