["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about peripheral vascular disease. We need to analyze the provided documents to find relevant information. From [Noninvasive evaluation of peripheral arterial disease], we learn that Doppler ultrasound is a noninvasive technique used for assessment of peripheral vascular diseases, including measurement of ankle pressure at rest and during exercise or reactive hyperemia. This suggests that the ankle-brachial index might be different at rest than during exercise. Additionally, from [Antihypertensive treatment in concomitant peripheral vascular disease: current experience and the potential of carvedilol], we know that resting blood flow may remain normal despite low perfusion pressure distal to blockage, implying compensatory reduction in tone of arteriolar resistance vessels. This information does not provide direct evidence about smoking association or L-arginine use.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
