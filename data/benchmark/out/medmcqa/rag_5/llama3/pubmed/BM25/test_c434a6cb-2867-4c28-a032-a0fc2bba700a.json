["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about chronic hyperplastic pulpitis. In the document '[Experimental allergic pulpitis in rabbits]', it talks about three different kinds of pulpitis induced in sensitized animals. One of them is characterized by a marked serous exudate and by an accumulation of lymphocytes, eosinophils and macrophages. This suggests that chronic hyperplastic pulpitis could be related to inflammation. In the document '[Agreement between clinical and histologic findings in chronic coronal pulpitis in primary teeth]', it talks about pulpotomy and the use of calcium hydroxide. It also mentions that no wound dressing is known to induce healing of chronically inflamed pulp tissue. This suggests that chronic hyperplastic pulpitis could be related to a proliferative response.\n\nBased on this information, I think that chronic hyperplastic pulpitis is characterized by a proliferation of a chronically inflamed pulp.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
