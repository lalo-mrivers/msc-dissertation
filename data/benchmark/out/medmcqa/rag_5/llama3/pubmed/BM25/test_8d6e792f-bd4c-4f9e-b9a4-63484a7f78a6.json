["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the best treatment option for an extraction socket. The relevant documents do not mention anything specific to extraction sockets or prosthesis fitting in the context of cancer of the paranasal sinuses or oral health services. However, the document on advances in the treatment of Hodgkin's disease does not provide any information related to dental prosthetics. The document on negative pressures during swing phase in below-knee prostheses with rubber sleeve suspension also does not provide relevant information.
