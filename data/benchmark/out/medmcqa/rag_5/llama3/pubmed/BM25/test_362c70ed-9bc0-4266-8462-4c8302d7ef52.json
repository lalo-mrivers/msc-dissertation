["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant document is the first one 'Study of the lysosomes by vital stains in normal keratocytes and in keratocytes from macular dystrophy of the cornea.' The study mentions acridine orange as an excellent vital stain for the 'in vivo' study of the lysosomal dynamics in cultured keratocytes. Macular dystrophy of the cornea is a condition that affects the cornea, and granular dystrophy is also a type of corneal dystrophy. Therefore, based on this information, it can be inferred that the stain used for diagnosis of Granular dystrophy of cornea might be similar to the one used in macular dystrophy.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
