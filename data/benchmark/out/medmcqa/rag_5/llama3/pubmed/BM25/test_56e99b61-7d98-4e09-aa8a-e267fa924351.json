["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the presence of receptors for nerve growth factor (NGF) in the olfactory bulb and cholinergic nuclei that send projections to the olfactory bulb. Neural cell adhesion molecules (N-CAMs) are present in the fetal human primary olfactory pathway, including the olfactory nerve bundles in the lamina propria and the olfactory epithelium. There is no mention of receptors for olfactory sensation being described or discussed in any of these documents. Therefore, it can be concluded that there is no information available to support the presence of receptors for olfactory sensation in any specific location.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
