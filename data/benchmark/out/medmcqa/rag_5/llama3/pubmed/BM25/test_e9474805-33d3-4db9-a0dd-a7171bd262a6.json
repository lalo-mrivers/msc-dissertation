["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided articles, none of them describe a constant whining noise that is not accompanied by tears or sobs. The article 'Acoustic features and auditory perceptions of the cries of newborns with prenatal and perinatal complications' discusses different types of cries in newborns with prenatal and perinatal complications, but does not mention a cry that is described as constant whining noise.
