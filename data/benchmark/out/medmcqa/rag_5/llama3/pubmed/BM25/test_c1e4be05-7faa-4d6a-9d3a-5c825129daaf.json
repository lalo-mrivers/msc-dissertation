["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents discuss orthodontic tooth movement, but none of them specifically address the lag phase of tooth movement. However, the study 'The periodontal changes following orthodontic tooth movement--a retrospective histological study in humans' mentions that PBS-injected rats had a plateau stage where tooth movement did not occur at all, while there was no such lag-time in the 1,25(OH)2D3-injected group which showed continuous tooth movement. This suggests that the lag phase might be related to the presence of certain mediators or inhibitors, rather than a specific time duration. The other studies do not provide any information about the lag phase.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: 2-3 weeks\"\n}"]
