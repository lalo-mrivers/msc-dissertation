["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the advantage of chromic gut over plain gut suture in deep wounds. The provided documents are comparing different sutures including polyglycolic acid and chromic catgut for various applications. There is no direct comparison between plain gut and chromic gut. However, we can look at the characteristics of chromic gut mentioned in one of the documents. According to 'Strength retention of chromic gut and synthetic absorbable sutures in a nonhealing synovial wound', chromic gut shows early fragmentation but does not weaken further after three weeks. This suggests that chromic gut may have an advantage over plain gut in terms of strength retention, as it maintains its mechanical strength for a longer period.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
