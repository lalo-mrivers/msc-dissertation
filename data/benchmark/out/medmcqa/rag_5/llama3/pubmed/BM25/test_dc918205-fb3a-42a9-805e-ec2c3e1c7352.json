["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Firstly, the patient is a 49-year-old male with 35 pack years of smoking, presenting with a painless mass in the left scrotal sac and microscopic hematuria. Laboratory investigations show that Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) are negative. Given these symptoms, we can rule out epididymitis as it is typically associated with pain and urethritis.\n\nThe patient's age, smoking history, and the presence of a scrotal mass suggest that the most likely diagnosis is testicular cancer. Seminoma is a possibility given the patient's age and smoking history, but the fact that AFP and LDH are negative suggests that this may not be the case.\n\nThe microscopic hematuria could be related to a renal cell carcinoma or lung cancer, but these diagnoses seem less likely given the patient's scrotal symptoms. Therefore, the most probable diagnosis is a testicular tumor, possibly a seminoma.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
