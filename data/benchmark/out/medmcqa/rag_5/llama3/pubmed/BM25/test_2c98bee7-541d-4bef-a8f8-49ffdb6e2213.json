["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for a normal WBC count. We need to look at the provided documents to find information about normal WBC counts. In the first document, it states that three hours following steroid therapy mean WBC count had increased significantly, with individual values ranging from -600 to +8,000/cu mm. This suggests that WBC counts can vary widely in response to steroids. In the second document, it reviews published criteria for distinguishing between bacterial and non-bacterial infections by examining the WBC count and differential. It states that the WBC count and differential could not differentiate between bacterial and non-bacterial disease. This suggests that there is no specific range or cutoff value for a normal WBC count in this context. In the third document, it reviews records of patients who underwent splenectomy following blunt abdominal trauma to determine whether white blood cell (WBC) count is a useful indicator of acute infection in the postoperative period. It states that the infected group had a mean WBC count of 21.2 and a mean differential count of 73/8, while the non-infected group had a mean WBC count of 14.2 and a mean differential count of 73/5. This suggests that WBC counts may be higher in patients with infection, but there is no specific range or cutoff value for a normal WBC count. In the fourth document, it examines the relation of white blood cell (WBC) count to the development of cardiovascular disease. It states that among nonsmoking men with WBC counts within the normal range, the age-adjusted WBC count was significantly associated with CVD and coronary heart disease incidence. This suggests that there may be a specific range or cutoff value for a normal WBC count in this context.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
