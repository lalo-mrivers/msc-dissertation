["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks what is false about enamel rods. We need to analyze the given documents to find information about enamel rods. According to 'Fracture properties of human enamel and dentin', enamel rods are anisotropic with respect to their orientation, with fracture parallel to the rods being 0.3 X 10(2) J/meter2 but on the order of 2.0 X 10(2) J/meter2 for fracture perpendicular to the rods. This means that enamel rods are not perpendicular to the tooth surface. The same document also states that cross-sectioned enamel rods in the pig were arcade-shaped in the initial and inner layers, and mostly round in shape with circular boundaries in the outer layer. None of the given options mention that enamel rods are parallel to each other or have a specific diameter at DEJ.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
