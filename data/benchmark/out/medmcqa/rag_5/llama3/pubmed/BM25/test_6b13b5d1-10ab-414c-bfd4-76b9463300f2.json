["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"There is no mention of the 'target sign' in the provided documents. However, I can look for signs that are similar to what you're asking about.\\n\\nIn one of the documents, it talks about the lucent cleft sign which is a partial tear of the annulus. It's seen anteriorly as an area of hyperlucency above the superior end plate of the vertebra.\\n\\nAnother document mentions the bulging fissure sign which is usually associated with Klebsiella pneumonia and has also been seen in pneumococcal and plague pneumonia, tuberculosis, mass lesions of the lung, and large lung abscesses.\\n\\nA new radiologic sign mentioned is the obliteration of intrapulmonary blood vessels which are seen below the level of the diaphragmatic dome. It's used to diagnose subpulmonic effusions.\\n\\nFinally, there's a document about diagnostic signs for diagnosing cavernous hemangiomas during dynamic bolus CT. The sign they describe is the visualization of foci of globular enhancement within the hemangioma.\\n\\nNone of these signs match what you're asking about. Therefore, I'm going to say that the target sign is not mentioned in any of the documents.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D: None\"}"]
