["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks for the opposing contact expected in centric occlusion. The relevant documents discuss various positions including centric relation, centric occlusion, and protrusive bite. According to the first document, the optimal muscle function during maximal clench is displayed in the posterior occlusal contact position, which is situated anterior to centric occlusion. This suggests that the opposing contact in centric occlusion is likely at the posterior occlusal relationship. The other documents discuss various aspects of occlusion and jaw movement, but do not provide direct information about the opposing contact in centric occlusion.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
