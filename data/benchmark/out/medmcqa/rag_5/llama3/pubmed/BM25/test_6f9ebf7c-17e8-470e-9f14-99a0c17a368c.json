["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to the study 'Hyperbilirubinemia, hypocarbia and periventricular leukomalacia in preterm infants: relationship to cerebral palsy', periventricular leukomalacia was found to be a main predictor of cerebral palsy in preterm infants. Further reading of the paper '[Imaging evolution and incidence of periventricular leukomalacia in preterm infants]' suggests that spastic cerebral palsy can occur without cystic lesions, but with persistent periventricular echogenicity. Additionally, '[Mid-term and long-term outcome in newborn infants with periventricular leukomalacia (53 cases)]' reports on the neuro-developmental follow-up of 53 neonates with cystic periventricular leukomalacias, and indicates that spastic diplegia is one of the most common sequelae.\",\n\"answer_choice\": A"]
