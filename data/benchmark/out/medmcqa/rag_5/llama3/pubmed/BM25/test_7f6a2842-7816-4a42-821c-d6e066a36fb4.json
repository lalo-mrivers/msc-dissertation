["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to the report 'Perinatal HIV transmission facts and controversies', it is mentioned that the rate of perinatal transmission is between 15 and 25% in Europe and North America. Since there is no specific information provided about non-breast fed children, we need to consider another document. The article 'Maternal factors involved in mother-to-child transmission of HIV-1' discusses the risk factors associated with maternal transmission. Although it does not provide a direct answer to our question, it mentions that wide differences (10-39%) in HIV transmission are seen at different geographic sites. Since this is a non-breast fed child and we do not have any information about the mother's health status or viral burden, we can only consider the range of 15-25% mentioned earlier. Therefore, our answer should be within this range.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
