["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe various receptors and their ligands. The first document discusses the benzodiazepine receptor ligand iomazenil and its binding site. The second document explains the insulin receptor and insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) receptor, showing that part of the cysteine-rich domain determines IGF-I specificity. The third document talks about a macrophage Fc receptor for IgG also being a receptor for oxidized low density lipoprotein (OxLDL). The fourth document describes the ontogeny of glucocorticoid receptors in rat liver and their binding sites.\n\nAfter analyzing these documents, we can see that LDL is mentioned in the third document as OxLDL. It is described as a ligand for the acetylated low density lipoprotein (AcLDL) receptor, but it also binds to the Fc gamma RII-B2 receptor. This suggests that LDL may be taken up by liver cells through more than one mechanism.\n\nThe key point here is that OxLDL is mentioned in the context of LDL uptake, suggesting that LDL itself may be a ligand for receptors present in liver for uptake. The relevant document also mentions Apo E as an important component of LDL. Therefore, we can infer that Apo E and Apo B-100 are ligands for these receptors.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
