["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the effect of radiation on all three germ layers. The documents provided describe the establishment and organization of germ layers, their functions, and their interactions. According to the documents, the mesoderm controls cellular organization, and its potentiality is inherent in all germ layers, reaching a high state of development in the entoderm and mesoderm at an early stage of development than in the ectoderm. This suggests that radiation would affect the mesoderm, which in turn affects the other two germ layers.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
