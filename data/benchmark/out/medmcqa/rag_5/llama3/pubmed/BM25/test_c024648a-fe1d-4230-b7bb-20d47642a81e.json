["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the participation of external and internal carotid arteries in the blood supply of acoustic neurinomas. The external carotid artery is involved in 6 cases presented, with or without supply from the internal carotid artery. Selective catheterization and embolization of the branches of the external carotid artery are described. Super-selective arteriography of the branches of the external carotid artery is also mentioned as a valuable diagnostic tool. The documents highlight the importance of collateral flow between the external and internal carotid territories, and mention that the distal portion of the external carotid artery remains open when common and internal carotid arteries are occluded.\n\nThe question asks about branches of the external carotid artery, excluding the options A, B, C, and D. The documents suggest that the ascending pharyngeal aery is indeed a branch of the external carotid artery. Therefore, it should be excluded from the list of options.\n\nComparing the options, we can see that option C - Ascending pharyngeal aery does not fit the description. The remaining options A, B, and D describe branches that are part of the external carotid artery system: Superior thyroid aery (A), Transverse cervical aery (B), and Superficial temporal aery (D).\n\nIn conclusion, based on the provided documents, the correct answer is option C - Ascending pharyngeal aery.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
