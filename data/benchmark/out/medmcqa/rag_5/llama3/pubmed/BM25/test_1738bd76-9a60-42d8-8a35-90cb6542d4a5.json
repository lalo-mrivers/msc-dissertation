["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks which amino acid is quickly converted to tyrosine. The provided documents discuss amino acid metabolism, but there's no direct mention of an amino acid being converted to tyrosine. However, the document 'Carbon 13 NMR study of nonenzymatic reactions of pyridoxal 5'-phosphate with selected amino acids and of related reactions' mentions the conversion of serine to hydroxypruvate. This could be a relevant finding. No other information in the provided documents suggests an amino acid being converted to tyrosine.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
