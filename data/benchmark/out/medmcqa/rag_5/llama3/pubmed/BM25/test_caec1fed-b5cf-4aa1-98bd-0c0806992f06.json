["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) plays a crucial role in regulating the levels of testosterone and estrogen in the bloodstream. SHBG binds to these hormones, making them unavailable for use by tissues. Changes in SHBG levels or function can affect the metabolism and availability of these hormones. Given that the question asks about the hormone affected most after a change in SHBG, we should consider which hormone is more dependent on SHBG binding. Estrogen is bound tightly to SHBG, while testosterone has a lower affinity for SHBG. Therefore, a change in SHBG would affect estrogen more significantly.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
