["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the most common systemic symptom during migration of larval phase of Helminths like Ancylostoma, Strongyloides, and Ascaris. The given documents describe different types of worms, but none of them explicitly mention the symptoms of their larvae. However, one document mentions that many larvae enter a quiescent phase during which Baermannization, an active recovery technique, fails to recover them. This suggests that some larvae may remain asymptomatic or not be easily detected. Additionally, another document discusses the possibility of fatal hyperinfection occurring when the host is immunosuppressed, which could imply that systemic symptoms may occur under certain conditions. However, no specific symptom is mentioned as being common. Therefore, it can be inferred that asymptomatic migration might be a possible scenario for these worms, but more research would be needed to confirm this.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
