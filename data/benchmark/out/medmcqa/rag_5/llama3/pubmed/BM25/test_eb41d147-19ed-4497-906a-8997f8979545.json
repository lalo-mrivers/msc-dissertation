["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the origin of the three embryonic germ layers. According to the documents, the establishment and organization of germ layers in gastrulating mouse embryos showed that a continuous recruitment of embryonic ectoderm cells occurs to the definitive endoderm and to the embryonic and extraembryonic mesoderm during gastrulation. Additionally, investigation of the fate of 4-5 day post-coitum mouse inner cell mass cells by blastocyst injection suggested that the entire foetus, including its endodermal components, is formed from the primitive ectoderm, and that primitive endoderm forms only extra-embryonic endoderm of the conceptus. Modulation of alphafetoprotein synthesis in the early postimplantation mouse embryo showed that both visceral embryonic (VE) and visceral extra-embryonic (VEX) endoderm cells synthesize alphafetoprotein (AFP). From these findings, it can be concluded that all three germ layers are derived from the epiblast.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
