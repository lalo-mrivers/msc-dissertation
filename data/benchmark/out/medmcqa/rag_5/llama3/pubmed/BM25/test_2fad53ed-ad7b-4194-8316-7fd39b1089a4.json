["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe congenital CMV infection and its effects on the fetus. From these descriptions, we can identify some common abnormalities seen in a fetus with congenital CMV infection. One such abnormality is sensorineural hearing impairment, which has been reported to occur in approximately 5% of infected infants. Additionally, the text mentions that about 5-10% of asymptomatic infants may develop problems relating to their CMV infection, including neurological problems. Given these descriptions, we can infer that congenital CMV infection may cause damage to the auditory and central nervous systems.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
