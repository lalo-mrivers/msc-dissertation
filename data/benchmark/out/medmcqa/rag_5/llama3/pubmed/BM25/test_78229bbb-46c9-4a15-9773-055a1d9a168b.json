["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents do not provide information about the mesiodistal diameter of deciduous or permanent teeth except for the study on maxillary incisors. The study found a significant positive correlation between lingual fossa depth and MD diameter in permanent maxillary incisors, suggesting that larger teeth have deeper lingual fossae. There is no mention of lower central incisors or upper lateral incisors. Therefore, we need to look at other studies for information about the mesiodistal diameters of these teeth.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
