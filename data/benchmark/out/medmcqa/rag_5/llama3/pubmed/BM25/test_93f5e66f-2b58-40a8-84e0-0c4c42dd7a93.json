["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking what Golgi tendon organs (GTOs) are used to detect. According to the provided documents, GTOs are sensitive to subtle alterations in motor unit twitch waveform and amplitude, as well as changes in muscle length. The responses of GTOs to graded force development of motor units were studied at different muscle lengths. Additionally, GTOs responded to active force development produced by single motor units and were also sensitive to passive forces during muscle stretch. Furthermore, the documents state that the static responses of GTOs to force developed by single motor units decreased as muscle length approached Lo. Considering these findings, it can be concluded that Golgi tendon organs are used to detect changes in tension.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: All\"\n}"]
