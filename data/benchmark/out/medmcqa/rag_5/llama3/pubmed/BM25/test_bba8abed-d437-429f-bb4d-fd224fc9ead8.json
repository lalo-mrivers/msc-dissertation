["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, specifically the 'The comparison of microleakage among three different dentin bonding agents in class V cavities' study, we can deduce that mesial and distal walls of a class V cavity are not dependent on the direction of enamel rods, presence of carious lesion, contour of gingiva, or location of contact area. The study focused on investigating microleakage in class V resin restorations bonded with different dentin bonding agents, and the results showed that the degree of microleakage was not significantly different among the three dentin bonding agents.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
