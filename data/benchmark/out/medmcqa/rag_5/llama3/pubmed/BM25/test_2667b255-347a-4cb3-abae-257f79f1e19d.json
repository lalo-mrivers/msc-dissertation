["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about Frankel's behavior rating scale, but none of the provided documents mention this specific scale. The scales mentioned are Hamilton rating scale, Beck and Overall rating scale, brief psychiatric rating scale (BPRS), global rating scale, word-graphic rating scale, visual analogue scale, graded-graphic rating scale, magnitude estimation scale, and color scale.
