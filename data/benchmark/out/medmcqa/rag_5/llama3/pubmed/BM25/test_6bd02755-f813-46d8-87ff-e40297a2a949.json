["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the hormone produced by the female adrenal gland. We can start by looking at the relevant documents provided. The first document mentions that the human adrenal gland produces and secretes inhibin-like peptide in response to ACTH. However, this does not directly answer the question about which specific hormone is secreted by the female adrenal gland. The second document discusses the control of adrenal androgen secretion, but it does not specifically mention the hormone produced by the female adrenal gland. The third document talks about congenital hypopituitarism in female infants, but it is unrelated to this question. The fourth document discusses the lacrimal gland synthesizing retinol-binding protein, which is not relevant to the question either. Therefore, we need to look at the first document more closely. According to the evidence provided, inhibin-like immunoreactivity contents in the adrenal gland were 1893 +/- 474 (mean +/- S.D.) IU/g wet weight tissue. This suggests that the hormone produced by the female adrenal gland is related to inhibin.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
