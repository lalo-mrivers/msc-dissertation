["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking which radiograph should be taken to confirm the diagnosis of multiple myeloma given a patient's history and intraoral radiograph. We can refer to the first document, 'Mandibular lesions in multiple myeloma', which states that the typical radiographic appearance of mandibular involvement in multiple myeloma is a well-defined 'punched-out' lytic defect, solitary or multiple. This suggests that the mandible should be imaged. We can also refer to the document on diagnostic accuracy and observer performance in the diagnosis of abnormalities in the anterior maxilla: a comparison of panoramic with intraoral radiography, which mentions that dental panoramic tomograph (DPT) views are as reliable as intraoral films for detecting abnormalities in the maxilla.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C: Lateral oblique\"\n}"]
