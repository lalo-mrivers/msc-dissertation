["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Oral hairy leukoplakia is described as almost exclusively occurring in patients infected with HIV. However, there are some cases reported where it occurred in patients who were seronegative for HIV. The relevant documents suggest that oral hairy leukoplakia is an Epstein-Barr virus-associated lesion and that EBV is always involved in the occurrence of these lesions. The prevalence of hairy leukoplakia was determined among symptomatic HIV seropositive patients, and it was observed to occur more often in Caucasian homosexual men with HIV infection than among heterosexual Africans with HIV infection. Hairy leukoplakia occurred more often in HIV-infected patients who had received either acyclovir or ganciclovir during the 3 months prior to examination. The fact that these lesions seem to precede the AIDS phase emphasizes the clinical implications of this diagnosis in HIV infected patients.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
