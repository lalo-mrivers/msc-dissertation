["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The difference between the skin and mucosa of cheek is observed by comparing the results from rat abdominal skin and hamster cheek pouch mucosa. The study found that the fluxes (Jmax) of beta-blockers through keratinized membranes were determined in vitro and compared with their physicochemical parameters such as lipophilicity (log k'0) and melting point (mp). A linear relation of Jmax with either log k'0 or mp was observed both in intact rat skin and in intact hamster cheek pouch, suggesting that the lipophilicity and thermodynamic activity of a drug in the crystal state primarily affect the drug's permeation through these membranes. However, the slope, dJmax/d(log k'0), for cheek pouch mucosa was greater than that for rat skin, corresponding to the lack of appendigeal shunt pathways in cheek pouch.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
