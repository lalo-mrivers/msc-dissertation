["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The trapezium bone is a cube-like structure at the base of the thumb. The documents provided describe various conditions related to this bone, including luxation (dislocation), fracture, and dislocation-fracture. None of these descriptions mention a 'trapezium muscle', which suggests that there is no such muscle. Therefore, we can rule out option C. We are left with options A-D. The trapezium bone has four sides, so it is unlikely to have a triangular shape (A). This leaves us with options B, D. Based on the shape of the trapezium bone, quadrilateral (B) seems a more plausible choice.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
