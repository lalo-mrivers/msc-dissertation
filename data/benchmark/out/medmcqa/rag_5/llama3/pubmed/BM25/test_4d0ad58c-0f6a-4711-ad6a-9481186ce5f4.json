["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Since the question is asking about the earliest transient change following tissue injury, I'll look for relevant information from the provided documents. The papers discuss various types of injuries such as mechanical brain injury, radiation-induced retinal damage, and splenic dearterialization. None of these documents explicitly mention neutrophilia or neutropenia as an early response to tissue injury. However, the paper on neurologic dysfunctions following cardiac surgery discusses potential mechanisms for cerebral injury, including reperfusion phenomena and neuronal cellular changes. This makes me think that a more general inflammatory response might occur early after tissue injury.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
