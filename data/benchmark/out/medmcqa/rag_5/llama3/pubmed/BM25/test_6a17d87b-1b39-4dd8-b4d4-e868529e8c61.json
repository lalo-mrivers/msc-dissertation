["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about a disorder where a circulating antibody directed to intercellular cementing substance of stratified squamous epithelium is observed. We need to find the answer from the given documents. First, we should focus on the structure and composition of stratified squamous epithelium in different regions. The document [The mucosal zones of the female urethra] talks about the stratified non-keratinized squamous epithelium found in the short female urethra. Similarly, the document [Association between keratin staining patterns and the structural and functional aspects of palatine tonsil epithelium] mentions that reticulated squamous epithelium shows an extensive staining for keratins 5 and 19.\n\nThe document [Transdifferentiation of murine squamous vaginal epithelium in proestrus is associated with changes in the expression of keratin polypeptides] discusses about the transdifferentiation of stratified squamous cells into mucinous cells during the proestrus phase. It involves a switch in the expression of keratin polypeptides.\n\nThe document [Effects on hamster vaginal development of a single dose of testosterone or estradiol given neonatally] talks about postnatal injections of a single dose of testosterone propionate or estradiol benzoate to newborn female hamsters, which produce a precocious vaginal opening at 5 days of age. Vaginal postnatal development, histologically, has shown that in testosterone-propionate-injected animals sinusal vagina is absent.\n\nFrom these documents, we can conclude that stratified squamous epithelium is found in different regions and its composition can change depending on the hormonal state. The answer should be related to a disorder where circulating antibodies are directed to intercellular cementing substance of stratified squamous epithelium.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
