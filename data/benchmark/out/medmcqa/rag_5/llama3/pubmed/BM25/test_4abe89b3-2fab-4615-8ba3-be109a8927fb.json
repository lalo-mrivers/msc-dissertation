["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe dental arch form and its relationship to mandibular morphology. The most significant findings from the study 'The human chin and its relationship to mandibular morphology' indicate that the amount of bony chin present is related to certain morphologic features of the mandible. This information suggests that changes in the mandibular arch dimensions may affect the position of teeth within the jaws. Tooth migration subsequent to surgical treatment of mandibular protrusion indicates that except for a decrease of the mandibular intercanine width, an increase of the mandibular intermolar width, and a decrease of the maxillary dental arch length, the dentition remains remarkably stable. This means that teeth in the mandibular arch are not significantly affected by changes in the arch size discrepancy. However, the study 'Arch form, tooth size, and occlusomandibular kinesis in the Ceboidea' suggests that differential maxillary-mandibular arch widths may guide lateral jaw movements, which could affect the position of teeth within the jaws.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
