["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the characteristic of orthodontic wire that describes energy storage capacity. After reviewing the relevant documents, I found that 'Resilience' refers to a material's ability to absorb and store energy when subjected to stress or strain. This concept is related to the tensile properties of orthodontic wire discussed in the study 'Tensile properties of orthodontic wire'. Therefore, resilience describes the energy storage capacity of orthodontic wire.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B\n}"]
