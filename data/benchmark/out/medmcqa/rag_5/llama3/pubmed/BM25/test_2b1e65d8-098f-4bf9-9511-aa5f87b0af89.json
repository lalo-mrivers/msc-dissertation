["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the anatomy and development of multirooted teeth. The paper on 'Periodontal treatment of multirooted teeth' mentions that the successful treatment was probably due to the quasi total elimination of plaque retention areas from the bi/tri-furcation area, which suggests that the presence of multiple roots is not related to epithelial diaphragm or cell rests of Malassez. The paper on 'The disposition of the apices of the roots of multirooted teeth in the alveolar processes of the upper jaw' describes the thickness and correlation of the alveolar process at different levels, which does not directly relate to the formation of multiple roots. The paper on 'Morphological and labeling evidence supporting and extending a modern theory of tooth eruption' suggests that bone apposition is most prominent in the inter-radicular region, which implies that the formation of multiple roots may be related to the development of the dental follicle. Therefore, it can be concluded that the presence of multiple roots in multirooted teeth is due to...\".\n\n\"answer_choice\": \"C: Toot bud division or bell stage\"}"]
