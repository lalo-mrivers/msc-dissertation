["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the cause of Trismus. We have to look for a document that mentions Trismus. The first document talks about oral cancer ablation and does not mention Trismus. The second document is about rickets and does not mention Trismus either. The third document is about colchicine's anti-inflammatory action, but it does not specifically talk about Trismus. The fourth document discusses inflammation caused by microcrystalline calcium salts and its effects on liver function. However, there is no mention of Trismus in this document as well. After analyzing the documents step-by-step, we can conclude that none of them explicitly state the cause of Trismus. Therefore, we have to look for another hint or information about Trismus. The fourth document does mention Trismus saying 'Trismus has not been a problem so long as physiotherapy is carried out immediately after reconstruction'. This sentence implies that Trismus is related to some kind of reconstruction or surgery. We can then go back to the first document, which mentions oral cancer ablation and reconstruction. It talks about unlined repairs of defects following oral cancer ablation. In this context, Trismus could be due to inflammation in the muscles involved in mastication (chewing), such as medial pterygoid.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
