["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the cause of relapse in Plasmodium vivax malaria. The relevant documents mention that P. vivax uses Fya and Fyb antigens to penetrate the red cell, and that this can lead to a problem of natural selection by P. vivax which would eradicate polymorphism. This suggests that P. vivax has a unique life cycle that involves hypnozoites. Additionally, the document on comparison of treatment schedules for Plasmodium vivax infections in the Solomon Islands mentions that strict supervision of drug administration is necessary to ensure radical cure, suggesting that relapse can occur due to incomplete treatment or residual parasites. Therefore, it is likely that the cause of relapse is the hypnozoite stage.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
