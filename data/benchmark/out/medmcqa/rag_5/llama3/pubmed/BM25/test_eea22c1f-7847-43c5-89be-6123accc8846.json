["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe resistance in Staphylococcus aureus. According to A gentamycin resistance plasmid in Staphylococcus aureus, resistance is frequently mediated by non-chromosomal DNA molecules referred to as R plasmids. This suggests that the genetic determinant of resistance characters may be plasmid borne. The same document reports a strain of S. aureus resistant to gentamycin-kanamycin-tobramycin-sisomycin, and experiments which suggest that the genetic determinant of these resistance characters is plasmid borne. Therefore, it can be inferred that Staphylococcus aureus resistance may be due to plasmid-borne mechanisms.\", \"answer_choice\": B}"]
