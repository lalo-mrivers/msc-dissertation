["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents discuss protein cross-linking processes. In the first document, it is mentioned that Cu2+ or Cu2+-phenanthroline causes cross-linking of (Na+ + K+)-ATPase subunits, forming alpha,beta- and alpha,alpha-dimers. Similarly, in the third document, chemical cross-linking of Semliki Forest virus proteins is discussed, where reversible cross-linkers are used to form dimers of specific proteins. This information suggests that cross-linking of proteins can occur through various mechanisms. In the context of blood clotting, it is necessary to consider the formation of platelet-fibrin interconnections and the retraction and lysis of the clot. The fourth document describes the process of clot lysis in dilute human plasma, highlighting the role of alpha-granules and platelet-fibrin interconnections. Based on this information, it can be concluded that extensive cross-linking of blood clot is done by Factor XIII.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
