["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about an extra palatal root when present on the mesial side. Upon reviewing the relevant documents, I noticed that there are several terms related to tooth roots and their positions. Specifically, the document 'Transantral, subperiosteal resection of the palatal root of maxillary molars' mentions the palatal root of maxillary molars, which implies that some maxillary molars have an extra palatal root. Additionally, the document 'A study of the anterior portion of the palate as it relates to orthodontic therapy' discusses the anatomy of the palate and the position of the roots.
