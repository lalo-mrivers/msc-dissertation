["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant document is 'Human meibomian glands: the ultrastructure of acinar cells as viewed by thin section and freeze-fracture transmission electron microscopies.' This study examines the morphology and ultrastructure of acinar cells in meibomian glands. The text describes how fat droplets and Golgi apparatus or endoplasmic reticulum are closely interdependent during holocrine differentiation. It is noted that human meibomian glands are a holocrine glandular complex, similar to sebaceous glands. Therefore, the marker showing holocrine gland is lipid droplets.\",\n\"answer_choice\": A"]
