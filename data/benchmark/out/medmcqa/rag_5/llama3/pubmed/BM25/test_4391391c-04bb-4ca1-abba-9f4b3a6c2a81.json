["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 76-year-old female with non-healing ulcer on labia majora for 6 months, measuring 2x3cm. The biopsy shows Squamous cell carcinoma. Based on the provided documents, Squamous cell carcinoma accounts for 2-5% of bladder cancer cases. However, since the patient's tumor is located in the vulva, not the bladder, we need to consider other relevant information. According to the document [Bladder carcinoma: therapeutic concept of the Urology Department of the University Hospital, Mainz], Squamous cell carcinoma should be treated similarly to transitional cell carcinoma. Therefore, we can apply the treatment approach for transitional cell carcinoma and adapt it to vulvar cancer.\n\nThe patient's tumor is staged as T2N0/N1M0; G1-2, indicating that the tumor has infiltrated the surrounding tissue (G1-2) and may have spread to regional lymph nodes (N0/N1). According to the document [Bladder carcinoma: therapeutic concept of the Urology Department of the University Hospital, Mainz], for this stage, TUR should be performed followed by local chemotherapy (adriamycin).\n\nConsidering the patient's age and comorbidities, chemoradiation with resection might not be feasible. Therefore, the most suitable management option for this patient would be to perform a simple vulvectomy.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
