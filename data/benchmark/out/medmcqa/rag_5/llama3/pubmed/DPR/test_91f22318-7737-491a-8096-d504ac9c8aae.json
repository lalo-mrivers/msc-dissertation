["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the necessary condition for calculating mean and standard deviation. From the provided documents, there are no relevant statistics or data analysis methods discussed. However, from general knowledge, it can be inferred that to calculate mean and standard deviation, the data should be on an interval/ratio scale. This is because interval/ratio scales allow for meaningful arithmetic operations such as addition and subtraction, which are necessary for calculating these statistical measures.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
