["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"There are no relevant documents provided that relate to Hepatitis B infection or markers. However, I can analyze the provided documents for any information related to viral infections or immune responses. After reviewing the documents, I found a study on immunological properties of ampicillin polymers, which mentions the suppression of antibody response to penicilloylated proteins by polymerized ampicillin.
