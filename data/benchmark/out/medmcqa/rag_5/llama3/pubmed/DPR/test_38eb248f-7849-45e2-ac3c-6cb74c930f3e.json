["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Since the patient has intermittent pain, swelling, and discharge at the base of his spine, along with episodes of fever and repeated abscesses that had burst spontaneously, I am considering pilonidal sinus as a possible diagnosis. Pilonidal sinus is a common condition found in areas where friction is high, such as between the buttocks or at the base of the spine. The patient's occupation as a jeep driver increases the likelihood of this condition due to the constant rubbing and pressure on the affected area.
