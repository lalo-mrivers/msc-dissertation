["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Since the question is about occlusal trauma (TFO), I will look for relevant information from the provided documents. None of the documents appear to be directly related to TFO. However, one document discusses poultry behavior and management. While this may seem unrelated, it does not provide any information that could be used to identify a common sign of occlusal trauma. The remaining three documents are medical cases reports. One case report discusses midline cervical cleft, which is not relevant to TFO. Another case report describes a fixed-drug eruption presenting as an acute paronychia. This also does not seem related to TFO. The final document discusses the importance of campaigning and political action for health visitors. Again, this does not provide any information that could be used to identify a common sign of occlusal trauma.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
