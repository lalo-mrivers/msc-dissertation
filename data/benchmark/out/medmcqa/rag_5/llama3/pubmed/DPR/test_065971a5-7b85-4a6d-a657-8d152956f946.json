["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks for drugs that lower IOP. The provided documents do not contain information about lowering intraocular pressure (IOP). However, one document mentions serum angiotensin converting enzyme (SACE) and its relation to respiratory diseases. This does not seem relevant to the topic of IOP. Another document talks about back injury prevention programs in small companies, which is also unrelated. The remaining documents discuss osteomyelitis, osteopetrosis, surgical units, and cultural influences on community health. None of these topics are related to IOP or lowering its pressure. Therefore, it can be concluded that there is no information in the provided documents that directly answers the question.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
