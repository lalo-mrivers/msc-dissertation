["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is related to the movement of ions across a semi-permeable membrane. This is a topic typically covered in physiology or biophysics courses. The key concept is the generation of potential due to the movement of ions. After reviewing the provided documents, I found no direct relevance to the question. However, one document that caught my attention is [Nuclear magnetic resonance and its applications to physiological problems], which discusses the study of physiology using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. This made me think about the potential generated by ion movement across a semi-permeable membrane in relation to electrical activity in biological systems. I then recalled the concept of the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz equation, which is used to describe the potential generated by the movement of ions across a membrane.\", \"answer_choice\": C}"]
