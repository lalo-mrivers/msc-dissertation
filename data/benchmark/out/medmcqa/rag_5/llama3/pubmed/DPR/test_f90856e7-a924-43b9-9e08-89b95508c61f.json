["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"After reviewing the provided documents, I found that none of them relate to dentures or retromolar pads. The documents discuss osteochondromas, population models, bleaching and porcelain veneers, organ transplantation, and public health.

Therefore, I will choose option B: Should be covered by lower denture.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
