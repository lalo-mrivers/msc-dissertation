["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the injuries caused by a bomb blast. The first step is to understand how a bomb blast causes injuries. According to the relevant documents (none are directly related to bomb blasts), explosions can cause injuries such as burns, air blast, and structural damage. However, the documents do not provide information on the specific types of injuries caused by a bomb blast. Therefore, we need to rely on general principles of explosives-related trauma.\n\nAir blast is caused when the shockwave from an explosion hits people or objects, causing lung damage, cardiac arrest, and other injuries. Burns are also common in explosions due to heat generated by the fireball. Force of explosion decreases rapidly with distance from the epicenter. The force of explosion is directional, meaning it affects areas directly under or near the blast.\n\nA triad of main explosive injuries seen includes bruise, laceration, and fracture, which are typically caused by flying debris or collapsing structures. However, this triad may not be applicable to the specific situation of a bomb blast.\n\nConsidering these principles, we can analyze the options:\n\nA: Injuries occurred due to burns air blast (True)\n\nB: Force of explosion decreases rapidly (True)\n\nC: Force of explosion is directional (True)\n\nD: Bruise, laceration, fractures are triad of main explosive injuries seen (False, may not be applicable to a bomb blast)\n\nThe correct answer is D.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
