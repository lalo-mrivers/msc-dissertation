["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about managing a nurse who got accidental prick from an HIV-infected needle. The key point to note is that the documents provided are related to various medical procedures and conditions, but none of them specifically discuss HIV or post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP). Therefore, we need to rely on general knowledge of HIV PEP guidelines. According to these guidelines, Zidovudine is not used as monotherapy for PEP. Instead, a combination of antiretroviral medications is typically recommended. Washing hands with soap and water after an accidental prick is a standard practice and advised.

Follow-up viral markers are typically measured 3-6 months after exposure, not just 6 weeks.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
