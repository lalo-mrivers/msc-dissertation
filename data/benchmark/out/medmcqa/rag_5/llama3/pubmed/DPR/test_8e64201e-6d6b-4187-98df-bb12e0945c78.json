["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about a male child with certain physical characteristics and symptoms. The relevant documents don't have direct information on this topic. However, the document 'Campaigning for change' seems irrelevant to this case. The documents 'Midline cervical cleft', 'Pregnancy toxemia', and 'Renal cell carcinoma and Reiter's syndrome' are also unrelated. The only relevant document is 'Laparoscopic cholecystectomy' which talks about a surgical procedure, not related to the symptoms described in the question. Since there are no other documents that could be relevant, I'll rely on my medical expertise and knowledge of rare genetic disorders. The child's physical features and mucous discharge from nose suggest an underlying genetic disorder. Based on this information, Hurler's syndrome is a possible diagnosis.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
