["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the types of cysts associated with vital teeth. From the provided documents, we can find information related to oral manifestations and treatment of certain conditions. The case study on 'Two root canals in a maxillary central incisor with enamel hypoplasia' mentions radiographical examination revealing one root and two canals. This implies that there is more than one canal present, which might be relevant for this question. Upon reviewing the options, we can eliminate A as it contains OKC which is not mentioned in any of the provided documents. B and C both contain 'dentigerous cyst' but dentigerous cysts are typically associated with unerupted teeth, not vital teeth. Radicular cysts are more likely to be associated with vital teeth. Therefore, option D seems like a plausible answer as it includes radicular cyst which is mentioned in the provided documents.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
