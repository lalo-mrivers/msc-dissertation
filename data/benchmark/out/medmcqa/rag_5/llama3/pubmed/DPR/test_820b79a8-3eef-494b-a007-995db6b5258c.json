["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"There is no direct information about LA blockade on the given documents. However, we can relate the information to find an answer. From the 'alpha-Adrenergic reduction of cyclic adenosine monophosphate concentrations in rat myocardium' document, we know that alpha-adrenergic receptor stimulation reduces cyclic AMP levels. This suggests that alpha fibers are susceptible to blockade by LA (local anesthetic) as it is known that LA blockades can be influenced by the type of nerve fiber being targeted.\\r\\nFrom the 'In vivo cholinergic stimulation of the rabbit oviductal musculature' document, we know that cholinergic stimulation was reduced by adrenergic alpha blockade. This suggests that alpha fibers are susceptible to blockade by LA.\\r\\nThe 'Penicillin-netilmicin synergism against Streptococcus faecalis' and 'Comparative effect of calcium and of the adrenergic system on calcitonin secretion in man' documents do not provide direct information about nerve fiber types or LA blockade.\", \"answer_choice\": B}"]
