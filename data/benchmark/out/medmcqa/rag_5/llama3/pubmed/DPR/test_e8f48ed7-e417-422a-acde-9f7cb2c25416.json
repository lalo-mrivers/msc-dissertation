["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Impression compound is a type of material used in dentistry for taking impressions. According to the information available, impression compound has properties that allow it to set at room temperature and maintain its shape. It's also a thermoset material meaning it undergoes chemical change when heated or cooled, but once set, it can't be reshaped. Impression compound doesn't show increased flow when kneaded with water because it's designed to retain its shape. Finally, impression compound has high thermal conductivity which helps in quick setting of the material. Therefore, based on the characteristics of impression compound, the correct answer is C: Shows increased flow when kneaded with water.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
