["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"There is no information about articaine in the provided documents. However, I can try to find information about articaine from general knowledge. Articaine is a local anesthetic used in dentistry. According to various sources, it's an amide which is metabolized in both plasma and liver. The plasma half-life of articaine varies depending on the route of administration and the age group. For children, the plasma half-life is around 2-3 hours.
