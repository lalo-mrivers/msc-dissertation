["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the processes that take place in mitochondria. Mitochondria are often referred to as the 'powerhouses' of cells because they are responsible for generating most of the energy needed by the cell through the process of cellular respiration. Cellular respiration involves the breakdown of glucose and other organic molecules to produce ATP, NADH, and FADH2.\n\nBeta-oxidation of fatty acids is a part of cellular respiration that takes place in mitochondria. It is the process by which fatty acids are broken down into acetyl-CoA, which can then be fed into the citric acid cycle to generate energy.\n\nDNA synthesis, fatty acid synthesis, and protein synthesis are all processes that take place in the nucleus or cytoplasm of cells, not in the mitochondria. Therefore, these options are incorrect.\n\nThe correct answer is none of the above because all four options are actually cellular processes that do not occur in mitochondria.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
