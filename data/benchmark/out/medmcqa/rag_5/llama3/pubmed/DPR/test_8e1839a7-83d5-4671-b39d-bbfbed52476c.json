["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the location of a missing root tip during mandibular third molar extraction. The possible locations mentioned are Submental space, Submandibular space, Para pharyngeal space, and Pterygomandibular space. Since the root is distal to the extracted tooth, it is likely located in the region posterior to the sublingual fold. This points towards the Para pharyngeal space or the Pterygomandibular space. However, considering the proximity of the missing root tip to the mandible and its expected path after extraction, it is more plausible that the root tip would be lodged in the Pterygomandibular space.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
