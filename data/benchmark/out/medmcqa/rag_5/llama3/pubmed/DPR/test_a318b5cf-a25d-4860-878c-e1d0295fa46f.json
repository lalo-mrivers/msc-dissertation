["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the symptoms described, we can infer that this child has a rare genetic disorder affecting glucose metabolism. The low serum glucose, ketoacidosis, and decreased pH suggest hypoglycemia, while the raised ALT and AST levels indicate liver damage. The response to intravenous glucagon after meals but not during fasting suggests impaired glycogenolysis. The increased glycogen in the liver biopsy further supports this hypothesis. Considering these findings, we are looking for an enzyme involved in glycogen metabolism that is defective in this child. Glucose-6-phosphatase is responsible for releasing glucose from glycogen, which would explain the low serum glucose levels and response to glucagon after meals. This enzyme is also involved in gluconeogenesis, which could be affected by the raised ALT and AST levels.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
