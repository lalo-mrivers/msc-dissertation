["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, let's calculate the absolute risk reduction (ARR). The number of patients who developed HT complications in the control group is 1800 out of 15225. In the intervention group, it's 1620 out of 15225. So, the difference is 1800 - 1620 = 80. Now we need to divide this by the total number of patients in the control group (15225). This gives us 80 / 15225 = 0.00526 or approximately 0.526%. Since ARR measures the absolute reduction in risk, it's the same as the percentage. So, ARR is 0.526% or approximately 5.26%.\n\nNext, let's calculate the relative risk (RR). We can do this by dividing the number of patients who developed HT complications in the intervention group by those in the control group: 1620 / 1800 = 0.9. This means that the new drug resulted in a 10% decrease in the number of patients developing HT complications.\n\nNow, let's compare our results to the available options. A doesn't match because ARR is not 10%. B and D are incorrect because RR does not equal 9. C matches because ARR is approximately 5.26% and RR is 0.9.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
