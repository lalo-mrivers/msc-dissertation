["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about autoinfection caused by helminths. Helminths are a type of parasitic worm. The key to answering this question is to identify which helminths can cause autoinfection. Autoinfection refers to the ability of a parasite to infect its own host. This means that the parasite must be able to complete its life cycle within the same host.\n\nAfter reviewing the provided documents, it becomes clear that only certain helminths have the ability to cause autoinfection. For example, Enterobius vermicularis is known to cause autoinfection in humans.\n\nOn the other hand, Taenia solium and Ascaris lumbricoides are not typically considered to be autinfectious parasites.\n\nHymenolepis nana, also known as dwarf tapeworm, is a species of parasitic flatworm that can cause cysticercosis in humans. This means that it can infect the human brain, but it cannot complete its life cycle within the same host, thus not causing autoinfection.\n\nTherefore, based on our understanding of helminths and their ability to cause autoinfection, we can conclude that D: Ascaris lumbricoides is the correct answer.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
