["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To calculate the number of pregnant women registered in a sub-center, we need to understand what Crude Bih rate means. Crude Bih rate is the total number of live births per 1,000 population. Since we are given a value for the sub-center (20), it implies that there were 20 live births in every 1,000 women.

We would need additional information such as the total population of women in the sub-center or the number of live births in the past year to calculate the number of pregnant women.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
