["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"When planning to remove an impacted tooth, the dentist needs to locate the tooth's position and orientation in the jaw. Impacted teeth can be located in various areas of the jaw, including the maxilla or mandible, which is why a lateral view radiograph would be needed to provide this information. A periapical film would only show the tooth's root and surrounding bone, but not its overall location. Bite-wing film may show the relationship between the impacted tooth and the surrounding teeth, but it would not show the position of the impacted tooth itself. Anteroposterior view could be useful for showing the relationship between the impacted tooth and other teeth in the jaw, but a lateral view is more specific to locating the impacted tooth's position. Therefore, option C: A lateral view will be all that is required, seems to be the most logical choice.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"]
