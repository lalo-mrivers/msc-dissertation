["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the retraction of mandible, which is related to dentofacial structures. The provided documents are about spinal manipulation, periodic solutions, midline cervical cleft, spontaneous spinal subdural hematoma, and fatal tracheal compression after haemorrhage into the axilla. None of these documents mention the mandible or its movements. Therefore, we need to rely on general knowledge of dentofacial anatomy. The retraction of mandible is typically achieved by the contraction of muscles that insert onto the mandible. Among the options provided, only the lateral pterygoid muscle can be responsible for retraction of the mandible.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
