["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks for a monomeric intermediate filament. Monomeric intermediate filaments are the building blocks of cytoskeletal proteins. Vimentin, keratin, and desmin are all part of the intermediate filament family, but they are not monomers. They assemble into polymers through coiled-coil interactions. Tubulin, on the other hand, is a tubulin protein that forms microtubules in cells. Microtubules are made up of polymerized tubulin. Therefore, tubulin is the monomeric intermediate filament.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
