["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the most common site of CSF Rhinorrhoea. None of the provided documents have any information directly related to this topic. Therefore, I will look for keywords that might be relevant to the question. The term 'CSF' stands for cerebrospinal fluid, which is not mentioned in any of the documents. However, one document talks about Neisseria gonorrhoeae isolated in Korea, and another mentions amyloid fibrils. Neither of these topics seems directly related to the question. Therefore, I will look at the anatomy sections in the provided documents. There are no specific anatomical details that would help me answer this question.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
