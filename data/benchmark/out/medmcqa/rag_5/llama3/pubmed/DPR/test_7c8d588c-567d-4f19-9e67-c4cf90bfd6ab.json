["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the effect of paralysis on the soft palate. The relevant information comes from the anatomy of the palate. According to the provided documents, there is no mention of the soft palate or its paralysis and potential effects. However, we can consider other relevant anatomical structures. The upper part of the nasal cavity is lined by mucous membrane, which is supported by cartilages and bones. The soft palate plays a crucial role in separating the nasal cavity from the oral cavity during swallowing. If the soft palate is paralyzed, it would not be able to seal off the nasal cavity properly, leading to nasal regurgitation. Therefore, the correct answer is B: Nasal regurgitation.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
