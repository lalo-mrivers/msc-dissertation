["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the management of a nurse who got an accidental prick from an HIV-infected needle. The key to answering this question is to look for guidelines on post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) for healthcare workers. According to the CDC, healthcare workers who are accidentally exposed to blood or body fluids from someone with HIV should receive PEP as soon as possible.\n\nThe first statement is about using lamivudine as monotherapy in PEP, which is false according to the CDC guidelines. The combination of two nucleoside analogs (zidovudine and lamivudine) is recommended for PEP, not lamivudine alone.\n\nWashing hands after an accidental exposure is good practice but not relevant to PEP. Viral markers at the time of prick would be important in determining whether the nurse was already infected with HIV or not. Repeat serology at 6 weeks is also important to confirm whether the PEP was effective.\n\nTherefore, option A is the correct answer.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
