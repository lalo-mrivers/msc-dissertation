["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Given the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, the patient is likely experiencing a severe case of hypertension. The patient remains refractory to adenosine, which suggests that the arrhythmia is not atrioventricular (AV) nodal dependent. Adenosine usually works by blocking AV conduction, so if it doesn't work, it's unlikely that the arrhythmia is related to excessive sympathetic tone or supraventricular tachycardia. The patient's blood pressure is 80/50 mmHg, which suggests severe hypertension. Given this information, I think the next step in management would be to consider using a medication that can help lower blood pressure and potentially stabilize the heart rhythm.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
