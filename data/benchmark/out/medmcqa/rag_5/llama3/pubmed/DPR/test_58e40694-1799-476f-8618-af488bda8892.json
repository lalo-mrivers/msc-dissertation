["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question presents a 2-week-old infant with conjunctivitis progressing to respiratory distress and pneumonia. Chest X-ray shows bilateral lung infiltrates, and the WBC count is elevated (14,300/dL). Considering the patient's age and symptoms, I will eliminate options C and D as unlikely causes of this condition. Option A, Chlamydia trachomatis, can cause conjunctivitis in newborns, but it is less likely to lead to pneumonia with bilateral lung infiltrates. Option B, Streptococcus agalactiae, also known as Group B strep, is a common cause of pneumonia and respiratory distress in neonates. Given the patient's symptoms and laboratory results, I believe that S. agalactiae is the most likely organism.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
