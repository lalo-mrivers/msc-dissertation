["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"After reviewing the provided documents, I did not find any relevant information regarding pressure on the angle of jaw or nerves related to airway management. Therefore, I will search for external knowledge. The nerve that runs along the angle of the mandible is the auriculotemporal branch of the 5th cranial nerve (V).

This possibility is not supported by any of the provided documents, but it is a theoretical consideration.\", \"answer_choice\": A}"]
