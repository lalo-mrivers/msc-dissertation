["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a morbidly obese diabetic woman who has failed metformin therapy. She also has a history of pancreatitis and family history of bladder cancer. Since she doesn't want to take injections, we need to consider oral medications that can effectively reduce her glucose levels. Based on the provided options, Liraglutide is not an injection-free option as it's a GLP-1 receptor agonist administered via injection. Sitagliptin and Canagliflozin are both DPP-4 inhibitors but they come in tablet form, making them suitable oral options. Pioglitazone is a thiazolidinedione that can be used to treat type 2 diabetes but it carries cardiovascular risks. Considering the patient's history of pancreatitis and family history of bladder cancer, Pioglitazone might not be the best option. Sitagliptin and Canagliflozin are both suitable oral options that don't carry the same level of risk as Pioglitazone.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B: Sitagliptin\"\n}"]
