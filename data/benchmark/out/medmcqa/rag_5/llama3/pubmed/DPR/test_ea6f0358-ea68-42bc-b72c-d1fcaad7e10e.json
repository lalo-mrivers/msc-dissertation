["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about lip and mentalis muscle contraction. The provided documents are unrelated to oral anatomy or physiology. We need to look for relevant information from the literature.

Therefore, we can deduce that lip and mentalis muscle contraction would not be seen in a simple or complex tongue thrust.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
