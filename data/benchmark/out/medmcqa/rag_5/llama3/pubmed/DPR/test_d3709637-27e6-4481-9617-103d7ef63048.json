["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The parent who is homozygous for the autosomal recessive gene has two copies of the recessive allele (rr). The parent who is heterozygous has one copy of the recessive allele and one copy of the normal allele (Rr).\n\nWhen these parents have children, each child will inherit one allele from each parent. Since the mother is homozygous rr, she can only pass on the recessive allele. The father, being heterozygous Rr, has a 50% chance of passing on either the recessive or normal allele.\n\nTherefore, there are three possible genotypes for each child: rr (homozygous recessive), Rr (heterozygous), and RR (homozygous dominant). Since the gene is autosomal recessive, only individuals with two copies of the recessive allele (rr) will be affected.\n\nWith this information, we can predict the outcome:\n\n* The children who inherit rr from both parents will be homozygous recessive and affected.\n* The children who inherit Rr from one parent (either mother or father) will be heterozygous carriers, but not affected.\n* The children who inherit RR from either parent will be homozygous dominant and not affected.\n\nTherefore, the probability of each outcome is:\n\n* 50% children affected (rr genotype)\n* 50% children carrier (Rr genotype)\n\nThere is no chance of all children being carriers or none being affected, as the gene follows an autosomal recessive pattern.\", \"answer_choice\": C}"]
