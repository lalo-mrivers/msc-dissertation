["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The provided documents are case reports and guidelines, but they don't mention pulpal injury progression or the causes of pain. Since there is no direct information about this topic in the given documents, we need to consider the general knowledge about pulpal injury progression and its causes. Pulpal injury progression typically involves inflammation and immune response, which can cause pain. The main causes of pain during pulpitis (inflammation of the pulp) include increased vascular permeability, which leads to swelling and pressure on the nerve fibers, decreased threshold of nerve fibres to pain due to inflammation and tissue damage, and arteriolar dilatation that increases blood flow and pressure.\", \"answer_choice\": B}"]
