["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the method of choice for a newborn child who has not passed urine for 36 hours. The relevant information from the provided documents does not seem to be related to this question. However, I can use my medical expertise to answer this question. Typically, in cases where a newborn child has not passed urine for an extended period, the first step would be to rule out any structural or anatomical abnormalities in the urinary tract. In this case, the method of choice would be an ultrasound of the kidney and bladder (Option A).
