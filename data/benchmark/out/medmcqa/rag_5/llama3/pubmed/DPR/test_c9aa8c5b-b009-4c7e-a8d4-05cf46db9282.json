["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the effect of a high dose of morphine on a patient with biliary duct stricture. The relevant information is from the case study about the effects of beta adrenergic blockade, but it does not provide any specific information about the effects of morphine on vomiting or respiratory centre stimulation.\n\nThe most relevant information in this case is that the patient received 12mg of epidural morphine, which is a high dose. This suggests that the patient may experience an increase in vomiting due to the high dose of morphine.\n\nAdditionally, the patient's condition is complicated by biliary duct stricture, which can cause nausea and vomiting. The patient was already experiencing retching and vomiting before receiving the increased dose of epidural morphine.\n\nBased on this information, it is likely that the patient will experience an increase in vomiting due to the high dose of morphine.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"]
