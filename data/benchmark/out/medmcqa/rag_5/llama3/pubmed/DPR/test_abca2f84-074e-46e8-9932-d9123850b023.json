["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"I reviewed the provided documents and found that none of them are related to biopsy or fixatives. Therefore, I will look for general medical knowledge on fixatives used in biopsies. Biopsy is a common procedure where a sample of tissue is taken from the body for examination. The fixative used in this process should be able to preserve the tissue and prevent it from decaying. According to my knowledge, 10% formalin is commonly used as a fixative in biopsy specimens due to its ability to effectively cross-link proteins and preserve the tissue structure. Therefore, I will choose A: 10% formalin as the answer.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
