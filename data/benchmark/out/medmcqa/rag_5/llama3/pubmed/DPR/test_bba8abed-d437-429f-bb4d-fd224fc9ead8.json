["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"This question seems to be related to dentistry or oral pathology. The term 'class V cavity' is a type of dental defect. Based on my understanding of the relevant documents provided, I found that none of the documents explicitly discuss class V cavities or mesial and distal walls. However, one document discusses osteochondromas and their relation to spinal cord compression syndrome, another talks about midline cervical clefts, adrenal medulla autografts for Parkinson disease, subjective contours in a bibliography, and lymphangioma of the lung in a neonate. None of these topics seem directly related to dental cavities or oral pathology. Therefore, I will rely on my general knowledge to answer this question.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
