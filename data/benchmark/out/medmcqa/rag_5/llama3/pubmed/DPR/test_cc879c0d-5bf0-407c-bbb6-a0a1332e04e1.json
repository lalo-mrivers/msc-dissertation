["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the best treatment for a high velocity gunshot injury with periosteal denudation & comminuted fracture. Upon reviewing the provided documents, none of them appear to be directly related to this specific type of injury or treatment. However, one document mentions 'reconstruction plates' which might be relevant. Another document discusses 'unilateral headache' and 'cervicogenic headache' but does not provide information on gunshot injuries. The other two documents do not provide any information that would help answer this question. Therefore, it is necessary to rely on general knowledge of wound care and trauma management. High velocity gunshot injuries often require initial debridement followed by reconstruction and grafting. This approach is supported by various medical guidelines and consensus statements.\n\nIn the context of the provided documents, option D 'Initially debridement is done, than load bearing reconstruction plates, and grafting in secondary procedure' appears to be the most relevant and supported treatment plan.\", \"answer_choice\": D}"]
