["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"In a research study, confounding occurs when a third variable affects both the independent and dependent variables. To remove confounding, we need to eliminate or control for this third variable. The options provided are all methods used in experimental design to minimize confounding.\n\nRandomization (A) is a technique that ensures each participant has an equal chance of being assigned to either the treatment or control group. This helps to reduce selection bias and ensure that the groups are similar at baseline.\n\nRandom Selection (B) is not a valid method for removing confounding, as it does not address the issue of third variables affecting both variables.\n\nMatching (C) is a technique used in observational studies to create matched sets of participants based on certain characteristics. This helps to reduce bias by making sure that each participant has a similar \"match\" in the other group.\n\nBlinding (D) refers to the practice of hiding the treatment or condition from either the participant, the researcher, or both. This can help to minimize bias and ensure that the results are due to the treatment itself rather than external factors.\n\nIn conclusion, randomization is the correct answer as it is a method used in experimental design to remove confounding by ensuring each participant has an equal chance of being assigned to either the treatment or control group.\", \"answer_choice\": A}"]
