["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about a fungus that exists as yeast at 37°C and hyphae at 25°C. From the provided documents, there is no mention of fungi or their growth temperatures. However, if we analyze each option carefully, we can eliminate some choices based on their characteristics. For example, Histoplasma capsulatum is a dimorphic fungus that grows as yeast at 37°C and hyphae at room temperature (not specifically 25°C), but it's close enough to consider it as an option. Sporothrix globosa is a thermally dimorphic fungus that grows as yeast at 37°C, which fits the description in the question. Candida albicans is a yeast that can form pseudohyphae or true hyphae under certain conditions, but its growth temperature is not explicitly mentioned. Cryptococcus neoformans is a yeast that typically grows at cooler temperatures than 25°C.\n\nAfter careful consideration, I think Sporothrix globosa is the most likely answer based on its thermally dimorphic characteristics.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
