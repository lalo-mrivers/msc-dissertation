["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First pass metabolism refers to the initial absorption of a drug by the liver after oral administration. Since we are looking for routes that will bypass this process, it means we need to find ways to administer the drug directly into the bloodstream or avoid the liver altogether. This eliminates options C and D as they still involve some degree of absorption through the digestive system or skin. Option B, intravenous, would directly inject the drug into the bloodstream, bypassing first pass metabolism. Oral administration is the only remaining option that may not bypass first pass metabolism, as it involves initial absorption by the liver.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
