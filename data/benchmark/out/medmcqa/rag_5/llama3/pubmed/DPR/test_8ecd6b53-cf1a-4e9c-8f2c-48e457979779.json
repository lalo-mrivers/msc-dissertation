["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 10-year-old boy with polyuria (excessive urine production) and polydipsia (excessive thirst). Laboratory data shows hypernatremia (elevated sodium levels), which suggests that the patient's body is trying to dilute his blood. The serum osmolality of 295 also supports this idea, as a normal serum osmolality is around 280-290 mOsm/L. Additionally, the urine specific gravity of 1.005 indicates that the patient's urine is diluted, which further suggests hypernatremia. Given these findings, the most likely diagnosis is diabetes insipidus, which is characterized by excessive water consumption and dilute urine.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
