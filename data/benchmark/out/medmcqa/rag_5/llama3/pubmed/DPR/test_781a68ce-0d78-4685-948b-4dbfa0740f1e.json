["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Diethyl stilbesterol (DES) is a synthetic estrogen that has been linked to several health risks, particularly for women who were exposed to it in utero. DES has been associated with increased risk of vaginal adenosis and clear cell carcinoma in females. It may also lead to microglandular hyperplasia, which can be seen on cervical cytology as atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS).

Therefore, all features except for malformation of the vagina and uterus may be seen in the child after birth.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
