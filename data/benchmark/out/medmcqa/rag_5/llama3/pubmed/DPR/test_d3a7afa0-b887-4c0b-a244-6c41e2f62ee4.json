["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the typical cervical vertebra compared to thoracic vertebra. From my knowledge of anatomy, I know that the main differences between cervical and thoracic vertebrae are mainly found in their structures. Upon reviewing the documents provided, I see that none of them discuss the details of vertebral bodies or facets. Therefore, I will focus on other relevant information from the provided documents. One document discusses congenital anomalies of the ventral neck, which includes a midline cervical cleft. This suggests that there is some structural difference between cervical and thoracic vertebrae. Considering this information, I can deduce that the typical cervical vertebra differs from the thoracic vertebra in terms of its anatomy.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
