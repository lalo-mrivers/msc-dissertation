["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Septic shock is a life-threatening condition characterized by vasodilation and hypotension. Norepinephrine, a potent vasoconstrictor, is often used to treat septic shock. To assess the response to this drug, we need to check its effect on blood pressure. Mean aerial pressure (MAP) is a better indicator of blood pressure than pulse rate or urine output. Therefore, the best way to check the response to norepinephrine in this patient is by monitoring the increase in MAP.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"]
