["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the treatment of a symmetric, expansile cystic lesion in the proximal humerus. Based on the provided documents, none of the symptoms mentioned seem to be related to glycogen levels of rat ova during cleavage, antibiotic resistance of Neisseria gonorrhoeae, stress and schizophrenia, or population models in a periodically fluctuating environment. Therefore, we need to look at the document that is most relevant to this type of lesion, which is likely 'Respiratory behaviour in Lymnaea stagnalis: pharmacological and cellular analyses'. This document does not provide any information about cystic lesions in the humerus either. After reviewing all the documents, it seems that none of them have a direct relation to the patient's condition.\", \n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
