["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about a cyst occurring under the tongue caused by obstruction of a salivary gland. After reviewing the documents, I found that document 3 (Midline cervical cleft) mentions a case report on an incomplete midline cervical cleft with histological resemblance to a mature teratoma with three different germ-cell components, including cartilage, striated muscles, small salivary glands, and nerves. Document 4 (Advances in clinical immunology) discusses autoantibodies, but it doesn't mention any information about cysts or obstruction of salivary glands.

Therefore, I'm focusing on the symptoms described in document 3, which mentions a case report on a midline cervical cleft.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
