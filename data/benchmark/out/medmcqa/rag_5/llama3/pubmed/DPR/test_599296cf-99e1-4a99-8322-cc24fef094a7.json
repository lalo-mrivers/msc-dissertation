["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to the relevant documents, specifically 'Screening, diagnosis and education of women with gestational diabetes', there is no direct correlation between the question's context and the provided papers. However, since the question is related to obstetrics and gynecology, I will look for information that might be indirectly applicable.\n\nThe patient's ICT (Indirect Coombs Test) result was negative, which means she does not have any significant amount of antibodies against the Rh factor in her blood. The Anti-D injection given at 28 weeks of pregnancy is likely a prophylactic measure to prevent hemolytic disease of the newborn due to potential exposure to fetal blood.\n\nSince the patient received Anti-D during pregnancy and has ICT negative, it is reasonable to assume that she does not have any significant Rh antibodies in her circulation. Therefore, there would be no need for an additional dose of Anti-D postpartum, regardless of the baby's blood group.\n\nBased on this reasoning, option C: No need of additional dose since she is ICT negative seems the most suitable choice.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
