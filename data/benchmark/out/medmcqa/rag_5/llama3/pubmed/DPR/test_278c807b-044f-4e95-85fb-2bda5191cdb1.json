["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"This question is asking about a MO cavity prepared for an inlay restoration. To prevent proximal displacement of the restoration, we need to establish mechanical advantage. This means creating a retention form that prevents the restoration from shifting towards the pulp. Adequate pulpal depth does not provide this type of retention, so option A can be ruled out. Parallel walls are also not relevant in this context as they would only ensure even walls for the restoration, but would not prevent displacement. The occlusal dovetail is a possible solution to provide mechanical advantage by creating a wedge-shaped form that prevents the restoration from shifting proximally. Finally, acute lingual inclination in the axiogingival area does not seem directly related to preventing proximal displacement of the restoration. Therefore, the correct answer is C: Occlusal dovetail.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"]
