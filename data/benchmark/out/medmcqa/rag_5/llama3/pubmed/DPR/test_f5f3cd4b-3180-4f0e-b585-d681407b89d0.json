["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To find the range in which 10% of 95% of the population would be lying, we need to use the z-score method. First, we need to find the mean and standard deviation of the IOP values. Since we have already found the mean (25 mm Hg) and standard deviation (10 mm Hg), we can move on to the next step.\n\nNext, we need to find the Z-scores for the desired percentage of population (10%). This will give us the range of IOP values that 10% of 95% of the population would be lying within. The Z-score is calculated as (value - mean) / standard deviation.\n\nTo find the Z-score, we can use the following formula: Z = (25 + 2.5*10) / 10 = 1.25. This means that 10% of 95% of the population would be lying within 1.25 standard deviations from the mean.\n\nFinally, we need to find the range of IOP values corresponding to this Z-score. Since the standard deviation is 10 mm Hg, we can calculate the range as: 25 + 1.25*10 = 37.5 mm Hg.\n\nThis means that 10% of 95% of the population would be lying within a range of approximately 17.5-37.5 mm Hg.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
