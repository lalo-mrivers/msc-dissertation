["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The investigator wants to study the association between maternal intake of iron supplements (Yes or No) and birth weights (in gm) of newborn babies. This is a categorical variable (iron supplement) versus continuous variable (birth weight). The data are not paired, as each woman has one baby. Therefore, we need a statistical test that can handle these types of variables and unpaired data. Chi-square tests are used for categorical variables, but since birth weights are also involved, we need something more comprehensive. Paired t-tests are used when there are paired observations, which is not the case here. Univariate analysis is not suitable as it only looks at one variable at a time. The best option would be to use a non-parametric test that can handle categorical and continuous variables, such as the Mann-Whitney U test or Wilcoxon rank-sum test.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
