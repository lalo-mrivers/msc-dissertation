["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The latent period is 10 ms, contraction time is 40 ms, and relaxation time is 50 ms. To calculate the tetanizing frequency, we need to find the longest time between muscle twitches that still allows for repeated contractions before a full relaxation occurs. Since the contraction time is 40 ms and the relaxation time is 50 ms, we can assume that a minimum of 90 ms (40 + 50) is needed for a complete contraction-relaxation cycle. To determine the tetanizing frequency, we divide 1 second (1000 ms) by the longest time between muscle twitches. Since 1/0.9 = 11.11 Hz, the closest option to this calculated value is 10 Hz. However, since the original question asks for the tetanizing frequency, which refers to the highest frequency at which a muscle can be tetanized (i.e., stimulated repeatedly without complete relaxation), we need to find the highest frequency that still allows for repeated contractions before full relaxation. This would be approximately 9-10 Hz. The closest option is 75 Hz.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
