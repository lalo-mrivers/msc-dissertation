["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about aneuploidy. Aneuploidy refers to a condition where there is an abnormal number of chromosomes. The options provided are related to trisomy 21 and trisomy 18, which are types of aneuploidy. Trisomy 21 is characterized by Down syndrome, while trisomy 18 is known as Edwards syndrome. Both conditions are typically associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Therefore, the options that describe increased in utero mortality are likely to be true. The option stating that there is no relation between aneuploidy and maternal age progression is also plausible, as aneuploidy can occur at any maternal age. Finally, the recurrence risk for non-disjunctional aneuploidy is indeed higher. Based on this analysis, the incorrect option is likely to be the one stating that occurrence of aneuploidy has a relation with the progression of mother's age.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
