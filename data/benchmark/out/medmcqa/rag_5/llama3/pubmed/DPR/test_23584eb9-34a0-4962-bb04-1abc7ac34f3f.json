["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about a new drug combination prescribed for metastatic melanoma, which prolongs the survival. This indicates an improvement in patient outcomes. In cancer epidemiology, incidence refers to the number of new cases of a disease over a specific period, whereas prevalence refers to the total number of cases existing at a given time.\n\nSince the treatment prolongs the survival, it means that patients who would have died earlier are now living longer. This implies that the number of patients remaining in the system (prevalence) increases, while the rate at which new patients develop the disease (incidence) remains unchanged or decreases.\n\nWorldwide trends show that as health care improves, prevalence tends to increase due to improved treatment and survival rates.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
