["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the composition of ligamentum flavum. Since it's a type of cartilage, we can look at the relevant document 'Organization of ground substance proteoglycans in normal and osteoarthritic knee cartilage.' This document talks about various types of collagen found in cartilage. However, there is no mention of ligamentum flavum specifically. But we can assume that it's a type of cartilage, so we can look for information on collagen types present in cartilage. According to the document, proteoglycans are organized in normal and osteoarthritic knee cartilage. It doesn't specify the type of collagen involved. However, we can refer to another relevant document 'Fibrillation of tropoelastin induced by proteoglycan.' This document talks about electrostatic interaction between tropoelastin (the native precursor of elastin) and proteoglycan resulting in fibrillation. It doesn't mention ligamentum flavum but gives information on the type of collagen involved, which is elastin. So, we can infer that elastic fibers are present in cartilage, including ligamentum flavum.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
