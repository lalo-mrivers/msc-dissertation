["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient had a myocardial infarction two weeks ago, which suggests they have coronary artery disease. The lipid profile shows an HDL of 32 mg/dL, LDL of 126 mg/dL, and TG of 276 mg/dL. These values indicate a dyslipidemia with high LDL and triglycerides. Rosuvastatin is commonly used for patients with coronary artery disease due to its ability to lower LDL cholesterol. Fenofibrate is primarily used to treat hypertriglyceridemia. Given the patient's lipid profile, we would focus on lowering their LDL and triglycerides.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A: Rosuvastatin + Fenofibrate\""]
