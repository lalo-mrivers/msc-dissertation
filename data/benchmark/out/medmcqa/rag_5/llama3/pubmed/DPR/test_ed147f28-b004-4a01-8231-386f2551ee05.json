["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about a cephalogram of a 10-year-old child with ANB = -4° and facial angle of 98°. We need to identify the case. The first step is to understand what these values mean. ANB (Anterior Nasal Base) measures the relationship between the maxilla and mandible, while the facial angle measures the relationship between the maxilla and the facial bones.

Therefore, we can conclude that the case is likely a True Class III malocclusion.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
