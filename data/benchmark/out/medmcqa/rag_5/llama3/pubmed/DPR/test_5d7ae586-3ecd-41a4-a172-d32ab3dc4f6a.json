["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Since Mass Drug Administration is a public health strategy that involves distributing medication to a population or community, we can start by looking for information on diseases where this approach is typically used. Puerperal haematomas and back injury prevention are not relevant here. Tuberculosis of the middle ear may be related, but it doesn't seem directly connected to Mass Drug Administration. Dental practice and clinical teaching don't mention Mass Drug Administration either. Lymphatic Filariasis is a disease where Mass Drug Administration is often used for control and elimination, so that's a possibility. Vitamin A Deficiency, Worm infestation, and Scabies are not typically managed through Mass Drug Administration. Therefore, the answer is likely related to Lymphatic Filariasis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
