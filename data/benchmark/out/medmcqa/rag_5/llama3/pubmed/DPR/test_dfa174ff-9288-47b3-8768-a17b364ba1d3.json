["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Aspirin is a cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitor. It will irreversibly inhibit the COX pathway. The question mentions 300mg of aspirin. This dose will cause prolonged bleeding time due to inhibition of thromboxane TXA2, which is involved in platelet aggregation and blood clotting. Aspirin will also inhibit prostaglandin PGI2, which plays a role in vessel constriction. However, the question asks about what the patient on 300mg aspirin would not show.\n\nThe relevant documents provided are about glycogen levels of rat ova during cleavage, beta adrenergic blockade upon exercise-induced changes in blood coagulation and fibrinolysis, histone-heparin complexes, glycogen synthesis in the perfused liver of streptozotocin-diabetic rats, and parabiotic reinnervation in normal and dystrophic mice. None of these documents provide information about irreversible inhibition of cyclooxygenase pathway.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A: Irreversible inhibition of cyclooxygenase path way\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
