["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the patient's acid-base status, we need to analyze his ABG reports. The pH is 7.40, which suggests that the patient has metabolic alkalosis. The pCO2 is 40, which indicates that the patient has hypercapnia. The HCO3 level is 25, which also supports the diagnosis of metabolic alkalosis. Na and chloride levels are normal. Since there is no anion gap, we can conclude that the patient has high anion gap metabolic acidosis with metabolic alkalosis.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
