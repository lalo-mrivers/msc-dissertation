["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the most probable reason why topical administration of 1% Pilocarpine failed to produce pupillary constriction in a patient with a large, dilated pupil. From the given documents, we know that Adie's tonic pupil is characterized by relatively constant glycogen levels during cleavage (document 1). This doesn't seem relevant to the question. Diabetic III nerve palsy is not mentioned in the provided documents. Pharmacological blockade could be due to the immunogenic effect of variously sized polymers (document 4), which might suppress the response to pilocarpine. Uncal herniation is not related to pupillary constriction or pharmacology. Therefore, the most probable reason is C: Pharmacological blockade.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"]
