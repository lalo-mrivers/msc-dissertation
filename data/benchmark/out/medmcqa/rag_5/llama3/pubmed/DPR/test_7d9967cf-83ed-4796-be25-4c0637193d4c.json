["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the absolute refractoriness of a neuron. This means that the neuron cannot be activated to fire again after it has already fired. The options provided are all related to ion channels, which play a crucial role in the generation and propagation of action potentials in neurons. Absolute refractoriness is typically due to the closure of activated sodium (Na+) channels.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
