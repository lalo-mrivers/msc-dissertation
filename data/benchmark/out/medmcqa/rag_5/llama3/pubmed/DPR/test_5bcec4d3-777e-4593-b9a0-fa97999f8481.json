["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question states that the proportion of false positive results is lower in population A compared to population B. This suggests that the specificity of the test might be higher in population A as there are fewer false positives. Additionally, the prevalence of the disease could also be a factor, but since the test is used in the same way in both populations, it's likely that the prevalence isn't significantly different. Therefore, the explanation is likely due to the difference in specificity.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
