["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The Widal test is an immunological test used to diagnose typhoid fever. The test measures the presence of antibodies against Salmonella Typhi (O and H antigens). The O antibody reacts with the O antigen, while the H antibody reacts with the H antigen. In this question, we need to find out what is not true about the Widal test.\n\nLooking at the given documents, there is no information related to the Widal test or typhoid fever. However, based on my prior knowledge of the Widal test, I can think step-by-step and provide an answer.\n\nThe O antibodies do last longer, but this does not mean they are not indicative of a recent infection. A high titre value in a single Widal test is confirmative of the presence of antibodies, but it may not be confirmative of a specific diagnosis of typhoid fever. The H antigen can differentiate between subtypes.\n\nSo, B: O antibodies last longer and hence is not indicative of recent infection is the correct answer.\", \"answer_choice\": B}"]
