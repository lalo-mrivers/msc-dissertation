["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has a normal blood glucose level as estimated by the glucose-oxidase peroxidase method, but shows a positive Benedict's test in urine. This suggests that there is an abnormal substance present in the urine that reacts with the Benedict's reagent. Given that the patient's blood glucose level is normal, it is unlikely to be related to hyperglycemia or diabetes. Therefore, I will focus on other causes of a positive Benedict's test. The most common cause of a false-positive reaction is the presence of reducing substances such as fructose, galactose, or amino acids in the urine. Since the patient's blood glucose level is normal, it is unlikely to be related to hyperglycemia. Therefore, I will consider Fructosemia and Galactosemia as possible causes.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
