["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about physiological changes during exercise. According to the provided documents, there are no relevant information about cerebral blood flow, body temperature, or lymphatic flow from muscle during exercise. However, it is known that migraines can be triggered by physical activity. Ocular migraine is a periodic loss of vision in one eye typically lasting 30 minutes or less. This information suggests that the blood flow to the eye may be affected during exercise. Furthermore, immunotoxins are not relevant to this question as they are used in cancer treatment and do not provide any information about physiological changes during exercise. Organs for transplantation also does not provide any relevant information. Finally, periodic solutions of population models in a periodically fluctuating environment is a mathematical concept that does not apply to this question. Therefore, the answer must be related to blood flow or muscle activity during exercise.\", \"answer_choice\": C}"]
