["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about preventing cross-infection with sensors in digital radiography/RVG. The relevant documents are not directly related to this topic, but we can think step-by-step to arrive at a possible answer. Digital radiography/RVG involves medical imaging, which is a process that requires minimal physical interaction between patients and equipment. Therefore, it's unlikely that direct patient contact with sensors would occur, making cross-infection less likely. In digital radiography/RVG, the sensor/image receptor is typically cleaned and sanitized after each use, but not necessarily wiped or disinfected with chemicals in between patients.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: Cover with impervious barrier\"\n}"]
