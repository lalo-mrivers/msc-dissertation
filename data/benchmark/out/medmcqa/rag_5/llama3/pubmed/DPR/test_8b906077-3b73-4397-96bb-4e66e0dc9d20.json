["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents provided are not related to isolated aoic stenoses. Therefore, we must rely on general knowledge of cardiovascular physiology and pathology. Isolated aoic stenosis is a condition characterized by a narrowing or blockage in the aorta, which can lead to symptoms such as chest pain, shortness of breath, and fainting. A pulsus bisferiens is not typically seen in isolated aoic stenoses because the increased pressure wave generated by the stenosis does not produce a double pulse. The cardiac apex is displaced laterally to the left due to the increased pressure in the left ventricle, which is trying to compensate for the reduced output caused by the stenosis. A thrill can be present in the carotid artery if there is an associated bruit (a sound produced by turbulent blood flow) or if the stenosis is severe enough to cause a pressure gradient between the ascending and descending aorta, which can produce a murmur. In the initial phase of isolated aoic stenoses, the blood pressure may not be maintained due to the reduced cardiac output.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
