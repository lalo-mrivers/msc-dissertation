["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The 1st arch is also known as the mandibular arch. It develops into the lower jawbone (mandible) and surrounding tissues. The styloid process is a part of the temporal bone and is derived from the 2nd arch, not the 1st arch. Similarly, the stapes is part of the middle ear and is also derived from the 2nd arch. The sphenomandibular ligament connects the spine of the sphenoid bone to the mandible, which suggests it is involved in the development of the 1st arch. Finally, the stylohyoid ligament connects the styloid process to the hyoid bone and also appears to be related to the development of the 1st arch. Therefore, based on this information, we can conclude that the stylohyoid ligament, sphenomandibular ligament, and mandible itself are all developed from the 1st arch.\", \"answer_choice\": A}"]
