["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, we need to calculate the elimination rate constant (k) using the information given. We know that 75mg of the drug is eliminated in 90 minutes, which is equal to 1.5 hours. So, k = -ln(0.25)/1.5, where ln is the natural logarithm. This gives us k = 0.2583.\n\nNext, we need to calculate the amount of drug remaining after 6 hours using the formula: Amount remaining = Initial dose * e^(-k*t).\n\nPlugging in the values, we get: Amount remaining = 200mg * e^(-0.2583*6) = 12.5mg.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
