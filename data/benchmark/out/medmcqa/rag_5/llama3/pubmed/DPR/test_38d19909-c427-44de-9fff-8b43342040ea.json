["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To calculate net filtration pressure, we need to use the Starling equation. The equation is PGC - pGC = PBC + π, where PGC is the plasma oncotic pressure, pGC is the glomerular capillary hydrostatic pressure, PBC is the plasma blood corpuscle oncotic pressure, and π is the protein-free fluid reabsorption. Given the data PGC = 42 mm Hg, pGC = 12 mm Hg, and PBC = 16 mm Hg, we can plug in the values to get 42 - 12 = 30. Adding PBC gives us 30 + 16 = 46. Since there are no proteins filtered, π is zero, so we subtract that from the result: 46 - 0 = 46.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
