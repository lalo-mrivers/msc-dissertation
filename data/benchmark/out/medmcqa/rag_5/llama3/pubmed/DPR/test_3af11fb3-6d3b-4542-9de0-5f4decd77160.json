["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the direction of processes involved in gene expression. The options provided are all related to DNA or RNA processing, so I will consider each process: DNA repair and transcription occur in the 5' → 3' direction; DNA replication occurs in the 5' → 3' direction as well but then switches to the 3' → 5' direction; RNA editing can occur in either direction depending on the type of modification. Based on this analysis, I conclude that Transcription is the process that always occurs in the 5'-3'direction.\", \"answer_choice\": D}"]
