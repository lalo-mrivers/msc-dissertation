["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about ganglionic transmission. None of the provided options are directly related to ganglion, which is a structure in the peripheral nervous system responsible for integrating sensory information from multiple sources. We need to think about what types of receptors are involved in transmission at this level. Based on available documents, we can see that there are no specific references to ganglionic transmission or nicotinic receptors. However, we do have some information about serotonergic and cholinergic systems.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
