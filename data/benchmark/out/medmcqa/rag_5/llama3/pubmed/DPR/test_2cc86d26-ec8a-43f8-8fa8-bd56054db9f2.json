["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about a 14-year-old rape victim who is 22 weeks pregnant. The relevant documents are unrelated to this specific scenario. However, based on general medical principles and laws, it can be inferred that the patient's consent is essential for any examination or investigation. Male doctor with female attendant, gynecologist performing ultrasound upon patient request, collecting vaginal swab, and UPT (urine pregnancy test) may require patient's consent. In this scenario, we cannot assume consent from the patient, so all options should be considered except one that requires patient's explicit consent.\n\nConsidering the given choices, option D 'UPT not required' is the only choice that does not explicitly require the patient's consent. Therefore, it can be done in this scenario without violating medical ethics and laws.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
