["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The concept of vasomotor reversal of Dale refers to the phenomenon where adrenaline, which is normally a vasoconstrictor, becomes a vasodilator when given after phentolamine has been administered. Phentolamine is an alpha-blocker that blocks the action of adrenaline on blood vessels. Therefore, if we give adrenaline after phentolamine, it will not cause vasoconstriction but instead cause vasodilation. Now, let's analyze the options: A and D are incorrect because they do not involve phentolamine. B is also incorrect because noradrenaline is not involved in vasomotor reversal of Dale. Therefore, the correct answer must be C, which describes the situation where adrenaline becomes a vasodilator when given after phentolamine.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
