["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about infective endocarditis being least common in a specific heart condition. Based on the documents provided, there is no direct connection between the given options and infective endocarditis.

According to the available information, mitral valve prolapse is not mentioned as a risk factor for infective endocarditis. Aortic stenosis is also not explicitly linked to an increased risk of infective endocarditis.
