["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 10-year-old boy with a contaminated wound over the left leg after a road traffic accident. He has received complete primary immunization before preschool age and a booster of DT at school entry age. Since he has already received DT, we can rule out the option B: Injection of human antiserum as it would be an unnecessary dose. Option A: Injection of TT is not correct because this patient has already received a booster of DT, which contains some form of inactivated diphtheria and tetanus.
