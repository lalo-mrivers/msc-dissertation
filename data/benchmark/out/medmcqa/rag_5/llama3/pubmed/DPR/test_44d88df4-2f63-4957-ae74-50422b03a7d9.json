["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents provided do not directly discuss cephalosporins or their interactions. However, we can rely on general medical knowledge to make an informed decision. Cephalosporins are a class of antibiotics that are related to penicillins. They have a broad spectrum and are often used in upper respiratory tract infections. Penicillinase-resistant cephalosporins would show cross-sensitivity with penicillins. Anaerobes do not require oxygen to survive, so cephalosporins' inactivity against anaerobes is expected due to their aerobic nature.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"]
