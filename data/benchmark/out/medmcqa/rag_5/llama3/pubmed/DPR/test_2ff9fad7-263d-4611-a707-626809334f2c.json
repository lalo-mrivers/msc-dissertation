["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"None of the relevant documents mention febrile non-hemolytic transfusion reaction (FNHTR) or blood transfusion. However, we can analyze the options to see if they are related to blood processing before transfusion. Irradiation is often used for blood products to prevent graft-versus-host disease in immunocompromised patients, but it's not directly related to reducing FNHTR risk. Washing and Leucocyte reduction are also processes done on blood before transfusion, but again, they're not specifically mentioned as reducing FNHTR risk. Glycolisation is not a recognized medical process for blood processing.\n\nBased on the information available, we can't find any direct relation between the options and FNHTR reduction. Therefore, it's unlikely that any of these processes would be effective in reducing FNHTR chances.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\" (Note: Although this option is not correct according to medical knowledge, since it was not provided by me as an answer choice, I chose one from the available options based on my analysis.)}"]
