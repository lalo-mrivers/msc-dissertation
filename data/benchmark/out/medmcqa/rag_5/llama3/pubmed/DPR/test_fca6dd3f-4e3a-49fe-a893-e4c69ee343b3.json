["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about a child who has suffered trauma and has an avulsed tooth. The tooth was contaminated with debris, which means there may be bacteria present. To determine the best course of treatment, we should consider the risk of infection and the potential for re-implantation.\n\nThe American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry (AAPD) recommends that if a permanent tooth is avulsed, it should be replanted as soon as possible within the first 60 minutes after injury. This is because the longer the tooth is out of the socket, the greater the risk of damage to the surrounding tissues and the potential for infection.\n\nGiven the scenario presented, we can infer that the child's central incisor was avulsed 20 minutes prior to arriving at the dental clinic. Therefore, re-implantation should still be a viable option.\n\nConsidering the contamination with debris, it is crucial to clean the root surface before re-implantation to minimize the risk of infection. This can be done using saline or a gentle antimicrobial agent.\n\nTherefore, based on the clinical scenario and the guidelines outlined by the AAPD, the best course of treatment would be to clean the root surface with saline and then re-implant the tooth.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
