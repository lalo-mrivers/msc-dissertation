["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the coefficient of thermal expansion of ceramic being much lower than that of metal. This suggests a difference in their thermal properties. In a joint where ceramic and metal are bonded, this disparity can lead to different expansions and contractions due to temperature changes. As a result, the interface between the two materials may not be able to withstand these stresses, leading to failure. Since the coefficient of thermal expansion of ceramic is lower, it will experience less expansion than the metal. This means that as the temperature increases, the metal will expand more than the ceramic, causing a gap at the interface. When the temperature decreases, the ceramic will contract more than the metal, causing a larger gap and potentially leading to failure. Therefore, the type of failure that may occur is...\", \"answer_choice\": \"B: Adhesive failure of metal ceramic bond\"}"]
