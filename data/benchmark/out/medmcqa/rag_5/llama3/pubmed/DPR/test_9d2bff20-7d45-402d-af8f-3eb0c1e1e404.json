["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about sodium iodide symporter, which is a protein that transports iodide ions into the thyroid gland to synthesize thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3). Therefore, we need to find which organ is responsible for synthesizing T4 and T3. The relevant document is 'Organs for transplantation. The Singapore experience.' According to this document, Singapore's Human Organ Transplant Act presumes that competent adults consent to donate their kidneys in the event of a fatal accident, unless they have refused in writing. This has nothing to do with sodium iodide symporter. None of the other documents are relevant to this topic.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
