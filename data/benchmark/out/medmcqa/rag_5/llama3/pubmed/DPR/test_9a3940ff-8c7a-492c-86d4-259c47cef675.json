["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about a muscle splitting incision. The provided options are all surgical incisions, but none of them specifically mention the type of incision required to access the anterior cerebral artery (A1). Therefore, I will review each option: A) Kocher's incision is used for orbital surgery and does not involve the anterior cerebral artery; B) Rutherford-Morrison incision is a muscle-splitting incision used for axillary dissection in breast cancer surgery, which does not involve the anterior cerebral artery either; C) Pfannenstiel incision is an abdominal incision used for cesarean section and does not relate to the anterior cerebral artery; D) Lanz incision is not a well-known surgical technique. However, it seems that there is a mention of fenestration in the first document [Fenestration of the anterior cerebral artery. Personal observation]. This could be related to a muscle splitting incision. Therefore, I will look at the last option.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
