After reviewing the provided documents, I did not find any direct information related to breast or breast cancer. However, I noticed that one of the documents talks about organs for transplantation and patienthood, which are unrelated to the Peau d'Orange sign. Another document discusses a multifactor transactional conceptual framework of stress and schizophrenia, and another talks about health visitors and campaigning. None of these documents provide information on the cause of Peau d'Orange of breast. Therefore, I need to rely on external knowledge or consider other relevant sources.
