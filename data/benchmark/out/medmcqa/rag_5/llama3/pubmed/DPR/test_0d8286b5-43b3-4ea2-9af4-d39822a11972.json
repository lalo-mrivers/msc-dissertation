["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about how dry heat destroys microorganisms. From the provided documents, there are no direct references to microorganisms or dry heat. However, I can conclude that the correct answer must be related to a process that affects biological organisms. Since the options do not include 'dehydration', which would make sense in the context of dry heat, I will focus on the chemical processes listed.\n\nLysis refers to the disintegration or breaking down of cells, but it's not directly related to microorganisms' destruction by dry heat.\n\nOxidation is a chemical process that involves the loss of electrons, but there's no clear connection between oxidation and microorganism destruction.\n\nHydrolysis of DNA refers to the breakdown of DNA through hydrolytic reactions. This doesn't seem relevant to microorganism destruction by dry heat either.\n\nCoagulation of proteins is a process that can affect biological molecules, including proteins found in microorganisms. However, it's not directly related to microorganism destruction by dry heat.\n\nConsidering the processes listed, I'm going to focus on chemical reactions that can occur when living organisms are exposed to heat. Dry heat can cause coagulation of proteins and denaturation of enzymes, which can ultimately lead to the death or inactivation of microorganisms.\n\nGiven these thoughts, I believe the correct answer is D: Coagulation of proteins.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
