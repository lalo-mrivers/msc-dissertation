["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the capillary oncotic pressure required for a net filtration pressure of 3 mm Hg, we need to consider the interstitial hydrostatic pressure (2 mm Hg), interstitial oncotic pressure (7 mm Hg) and capillary hydrostatic pressure (25 mm Hg). Since there is a net filtration pressure of 3 mm Hg, it means that the fluid movement from the capillaries into the interstitium is occurring. Therefore, we need to calculate the capillary oncotic pressure that would allow this movement to occur.\n\nLet's assume that the total oncotic pressure (interstitial oncotic pressure + capillary oncotic pressure) is equal to the sum of the two pressures. This means that the capillary oncotic pressure should be high enough to counterbalance the effects of the interstitial hydrostatic pressure and the capillary hydrostatic pressure.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the difference between the capillary hydrostatic pressure (25 mm Hg) and the interstitial hydrostatic pressure (2 mm Hg), which is 23 mm Hg. This means that there needs to be an oncotic pressure gradient of at least 23 mm Hg to allow for fluid movement from the capillaries into the interstitium.\n\nConsidering the interstitial oncotic pressure (7 mm Hg) and adding it to this value, we get a total oncotic pressure of at least 30 mm Hg. Therefore, the capillary oncotic pressure should be high enough to achieve this total oncotic pressure.\n\nSince there is no mention of the interstitial osmolar concentration in the problem, we can assume that the interstitial oncotic pressure is directly proportional to the plasma oncotic pressure. If this is the case, then the capillary oncotic pressure would need to be at least 23 mm Hg (the difference between the capillary hydrostatic and interstitial hydrostatic pressures) plus the interstitial oncotic pressure (7 mm Hg), which gives us a total of 30 mm Hg.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that the capillary oncotic pressure should be at least 30 mm Hg to allow for a net filtration pressure of 3 mm Hg.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
