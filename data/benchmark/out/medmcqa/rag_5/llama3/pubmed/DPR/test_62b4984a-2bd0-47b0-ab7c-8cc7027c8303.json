["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking which one of the options is NOT a criterion for making a diagnosis of chronic myeloid leukemia in accelerated phase. The provided documents do not have any information about chronic myeloid leukemia or its acceleration phase, so we need to rely on general medical knowledge. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) classification of acute myeloid leukaemia, one of the criteria for accelerated phase is blasts 10-29% of WBCs in peripheral blood. Therefore, option A does not match this criterion. The other options B, C and D do not seem relevant to the diagnosis of chronic myeloid leukemia in accelerated phase.
