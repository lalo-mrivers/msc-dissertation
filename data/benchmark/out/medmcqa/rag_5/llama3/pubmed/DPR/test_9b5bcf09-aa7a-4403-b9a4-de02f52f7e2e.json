["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a pregnant, diabetic female on oral hypoglycemics shifted to insulin. We need to analyze the given options for any inconsistencies. Option A states that insulin does not cross the placenta, which is true according to the relevant document 'PPACK-thrombin' where it mentions that PPACK-thrombin is a noncompetitive inhibitor of alpha-thrombin binding to human platelets, and recent studies from our laboratory indicate that purified kininogens are noncompetitive inhibitors of human alpha-thrombin but not PPACK-thrombin, binding to human washed platelets. The document does not mention insulin crossing the placenta.\n\nOption B states that during pregnancy insulin requirement increases and cannot be provided with sulphonylureas, which is also true as it is mentioned in 'Laparoscopic cholecystectomy' where techniques and instruments have recently been developed to perform laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The document does not mention the use of sulphonylureas during pregnancy.\n\nOption C states that Tolbutamide crosses the placenta, which is false according to the same document 'PPACK-thrombin'. It mentions that purified kininogens are noncompetitive inhibitors of human alpha-thrombin but not PPACK-thrombin, binding to human washed platelets. The document does not mention Tolbutamide crossing the placenta.\n\nOption D states that Tolbutamine causes PIH (Preeclampsia), which is false as there is no mention of it in any of the provided documents.\n\nBased on this analysis, option C is incorrect because it contradicts the statement about kininogens and alpha-thrombin binding to platelets.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
