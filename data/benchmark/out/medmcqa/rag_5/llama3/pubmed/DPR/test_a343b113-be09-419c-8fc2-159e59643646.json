["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"There is no relevant information about dental morphology or anatomy in the provided documents. The documents are primarily focused on medical topics such as infectious diseases, muscular dystrophy, and meningitis. As a result, I can only make an educated guess based on general knowledge of dental anatomy. Maxillary central incisors and canines have different morphologies, with canines being larger and having a more distinctive shape. Therefore, it is likely that the height of contour (the highest point) of a maxillary canine would be greater than that of a maxillary central incisor.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
