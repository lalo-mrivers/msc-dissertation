["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The study is related to the effect of sugar restriction on diet. Since it was beneficial in presence of unfavorable hygiene, I'm looking for a study that investigated the impact of sugar restriction in a specific environment or setting. None of the given options mention 'unfavorable hygiene', but Vipeholm and Turku are studies known for their investigation of the effects of diets with different levels of sugar on dental health.
