["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"No relevant information is provided about the masticatory space or related infections. However, none of the provided documents mention the terms 'masticatory' or 'space infection'. Therefore, it is necessary to consider general knowledge and dental anatomy. The masticatory space is also known as the infratemporal fossa, which contains the maxillary sinus, mandibular teeth, and surrounding soft tissues. Infection of this space can be related to dental origin, such as a root abscess or pericoronitis, or from adjacent spaces like the lateral pharyngeal space or parotid space. Tonsillar abscess is not directly associated with the masticatory space. Based on general knowledge and anatomy, the possible causes of infection in the masticatory space are dental origin or extension from surrounding areas.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
