["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about working side contact in a medical context. The provided documents are about various medical topics such as spontaneous subcapsular hematoma of the kidney, organs for transplantation, teaching new acne patients with a customized slide sound program, therapeutic manipulation, and campaigning for change. None of these topics seem to be directly related to 'working side contact'. However, one document that could potentially provide relevant information is 'Manipulation: an objective analysis of the literature' which talks about therapeutic manipulation in spinal pain management. This makes me think that 'working side contact' might be a term related to manual therapy or physical medicine, possibly referring to the direction of movement during manipulation.\", \"answer_choice\": B}"]
