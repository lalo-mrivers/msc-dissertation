["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the success of pulpectomy and pulp capping in primary teeth. The relevant document appears to be 'Periodontal aspects of hereditary epidermolysis bullosa' which discusses oral manifestations and periodontal alterations, but it doesn't provide information related to pulpectomy and pulp capping. Another document that seems to be unrelated is 'Transcription factors: positive and negative regulators of cell growth and disease'. The remaining documents are 'Periodic solutions of population models in a periodically fluctuating environment' which is about mathematical modeling and does not relate to teeth or dentistry, and '[Spontaneous subcapsular hematoma of the kidney]' which is about kidney pathology. Therefore, the most relevant document is actually an external knowledge on dental anatomy and physiology, specifically 'Solitary osteochondroma presenting as a neck mass with spinal cord compression syndrome'. It mentions that 'Osteochondromas are a rare cause of spinal pathology and neurological dysfunction.' However, this does not provide direct information about pulpectomy and pulp capping. The only option that seems plausible is increased odontoblastic activity in the young (A). Odontoblasts are tooth cells responsible for dentin formation, and it's possible that their increased activity could be beneficial for pulpotomy and pulp capping.\", \"answer_choice\": A}"]
