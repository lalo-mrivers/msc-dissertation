["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The submandibular duct is exposed via intraoral approach. This means we are looking at a procedure that involves opening the mouth to access the area. The options provide information about the tissues or structures that might be incised to expose the submandibular duct. The key point here is that it's an intraoral approach, which implies that the incision is made within the oral cavity. This eliminates options C and D as they do not relate directly to the oral cavity. Option B, mucous membrane, is also unlikely as it would not provide a clear pathway for exposing the submandibular duct. Therefore, the most likely option is A: Buccinator, which forms part of the cheek wall and can be incised to access the submandibular duct via an intraoral approach.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
