["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about a fracture mandible (jawbone) and the forces present when loading it posterior to the site of fracture. This suggests that we are looking at the inferior border of the mandible, as this is where the fracture is located. The options describe the types of forces that could be present on the upper, medial, or inferior surfaces of the mandible. Since the fracture is posterior to the site of loading, it's likely that the force would be transmitted through the inferior surface of the mandible. Therefore, we are looking for an option that describes compression on this surface.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
