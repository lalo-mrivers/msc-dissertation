["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the best blood product to administer preoperatively to patients with classic hemophilia to assure surgical hemostasis. Classic hemophilia is a type of hemophilia caused by a deficiency in clotting factor VIII (antihemophilic factor). To treat this condition, it's essential to use a blood product that contains factor VIII.
