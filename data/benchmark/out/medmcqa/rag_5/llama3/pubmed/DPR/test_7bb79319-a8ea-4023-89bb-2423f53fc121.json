["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"During surgical excision of the parotid gland, I would focus on the anatomy of the area. The parotid gland is located near several important nerves and structures. The lesser occipital nerve, hypoglossal nerve, and chorda tympani are all nearby, but they are not typically damaged during a surgical excision of the parotid gland. The facial nerve and auriculotemporal nerve, on the other hand, run through or near the parotid gland and could be damaged during surgery. There is no mention of the submandibular duct being related to the parotid gland, so it's unlikely that would be damaged. Finally, the cervical fascia is a layer of connective tissue that surrounds the neck and isn't directly related to the parotid gland or surgical excision.\", \"answer_choice\": B}"]
