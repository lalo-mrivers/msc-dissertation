["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the reciprocal arm taper. The relevant information is from the documents that discuss hyaluronic acid and proteoglycans. Hyaluronic acid binds to proteoglycans, and this binding is impaired in osteoarthritic cartilage. This suggests that there may be a defect in the interaction between hyaluronic acid and proteoglycans in osteoarthritis. Since the question is about the reciprocal arm taper, we need to think about how hyaluronic acid binds to proteoglycans. The binding occurs in three dimensions, which means that it requires length, width, and height. Therefore, the correct answer is C: 3 dimension.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
