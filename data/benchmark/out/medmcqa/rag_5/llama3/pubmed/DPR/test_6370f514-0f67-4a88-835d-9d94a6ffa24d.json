Pathognomonic signs are specific signs that are highly indicative of a particular diagnosis or condition. Mandibular fractures typically involve the bones of the jaw, and there are several possible signs that could indicate this.

Therefore, I will rely on general medical knowledge to answer this question.\", \"answer_choice\": D}"]
