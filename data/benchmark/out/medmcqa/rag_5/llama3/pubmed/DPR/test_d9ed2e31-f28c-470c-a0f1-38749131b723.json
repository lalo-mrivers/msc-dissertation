["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the features of a newborn's skull. The options provided are related to various aspects of the skull such as diploe, styloid process, anterior fontanelle, and mastoid process. Since there is no information provided in the given documents that is specific to the development of these skull features in a newborn, we need to rely on general knowledge about fetal development.\n\nThe styloid process is a small bony projection attached to the temporal bone, which fuses with it during early childhood. It's unlikely for this process not to have fused by birth.\n\nThe diploe refers to the spongy layer of cancellous tissue beneath the outer table of the skull. In fetuses, the diploe starts developing around 12 weeks of gestation and is fully formed by around 24 weeks.\n\nAn anterior fontanelle is a normal finding in newborns, typically closing by the time the child reaches 18 months of age.\n\nThe mastoid process is present at birth but may not be fully developed until early childhood.\n\nBased on this information, the feature that is unlikely to be true for a newborn's skull is: D. Mastoid process is of adult size. This is because the mastoid process continues to develop after birth and reaches its adult size by early childhood.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
