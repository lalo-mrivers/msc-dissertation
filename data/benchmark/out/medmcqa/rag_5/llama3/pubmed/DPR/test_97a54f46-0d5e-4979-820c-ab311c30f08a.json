["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the effect of exercise on end systolic volume (ESV), we need to look at how physiological exercise affects cardiac function. Physiological exercise is a normal bodily response that occurs during exercise within the individual's physical capabilities. During such exercise, the heart rate and blood pressure increase, but the ventricular function remains within its normal range. This means that the ESV should remain relatively unchanged as the heart adapts to meet the increased oxygen demands of the exercising muscles.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
