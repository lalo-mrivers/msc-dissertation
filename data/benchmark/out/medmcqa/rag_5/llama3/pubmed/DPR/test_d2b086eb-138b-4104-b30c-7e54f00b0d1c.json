["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, I will need to think about the key figures in statistics. The 'father of statistics' is a term often used to describe someone who made significant contributions to the field of statistics. John Graunt and John Snow are both considered pioneers in the field of statistics, with Graunt being known for his work on mortality rates and Snow being credited with the development of statistical methods for tracking diseases. MacMahon is not a well-known figure in the history of statistics, so I can eliminate him from consideration. John M. Last is also not a key figure in the history of statistics, as he is more known for his work in epidemiology than statistics. Therefore, based on my knowledge of the field and the available information, I believe that option B, John Graunt, is the correct answer.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
