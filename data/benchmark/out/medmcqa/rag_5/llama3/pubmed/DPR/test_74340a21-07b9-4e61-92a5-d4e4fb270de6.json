["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"ECG axis is 90 degrees which means it's left anterior. The maximum voltage of R wave would be present in lead where the electrical activity from the ventricles is maximal. Since the lead I is the one that records the electrical activity from the septal region, and lead aVL is the one that records the electrical activity from the lateral wall of the left ventricle. As per Einthoven's law, aVL would record more voltage than I since it's recording the electric activity from a larger area of the left ventricle. So, the maximum voltage of R wave would be present in lead aVL.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
