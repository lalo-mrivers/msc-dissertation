["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To solve this problem, we need to first calculate the initial rate of reaction when the enzyme concentration is high and substrate concentration is also high. Since the substrate concentration is 1000 times the Km value of the enzyme, the reaction is in the saturating region where the rate of reaction is directly proportional to the enzyme concentration. Therefore, we can write an equation for the initial rate of reaction: Rate = k [E] [S]. Substituting the values given, we get: 17/9 = k (2/3) (4). Now, we need to calculate the new enzyme concentration and substrate concentration when the enzyme concentration is changed to 1/3 and substrate concentration is doubled. This gives us a new enzyme concentration of (2/3) and a substrate concentration of 8. Substituting these values into the equation for the initial rate of reaction, we get: Rate = k ((2/3) (8)). Now, we need to find the time taken to convert the same amount of product (12 microgram/ml). Since the reaction is in the saturating region, the rate of reaction is directly proportional to the enzyme concentration. Therefore, when the enzyme concentration is increased by a factor of 1.5 (from 2/3 to 1), the rate of reaction will also increase by a factor of 1.5. This gives us a new time taken for the reaction: 9 * 1.5 = 13.5 minutes.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
