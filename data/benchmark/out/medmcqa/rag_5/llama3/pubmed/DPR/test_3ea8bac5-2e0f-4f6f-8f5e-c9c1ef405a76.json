["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking how ammonia from the brain is removed. The relevant information comes from the first document, 'Potentiation of exercise ventilatory response by airway CO2 and dead space loading'. This study examines the effects of different modes of airway CO2 load on the ventilation-CO2 output (VE-VCO2) relationship during mild to moderate exercise. There is no direct mention of ammonia removal from the brain in this document, but we can make an educated guess based on our general knowledge of physiology.\n\nThe brain primarily uses glutamate as a neurotransmitter, which is excitatory. However, excessive levels of glutamate can be toxic and need to be removed from the brain. One way this happens is through the process of glutamine synthesis, where glutamate is converted into glutamine in astrocytes (star-shaped cells) and then released into the bloodstream.\n\nIn the blood, glutamine is converted back into glutamate and ammonia by the enzyme glutaminase. The ammonia is then removed from the body primarily as urea through a process called the urea cycle, which occurs mainly in the liver. Therefore, we can conclude that ammonia from the brain is primarily removed as urea.\n\nBased on this reasoning, our answer choice should be A: Urea.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
