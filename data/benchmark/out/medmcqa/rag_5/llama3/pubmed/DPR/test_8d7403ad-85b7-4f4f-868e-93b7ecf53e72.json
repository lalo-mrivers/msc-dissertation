["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the marker that appears last during a myocardial infarction (MI). The relevant documents provided are not directly related to this topic. However, we can look for information on markers used in diagnosing MI. According to 'Developmental regulation of the cell cycle', there is no mention of MI or biomarkers. In 'The normal development of teeth', there is no discussion of MI or cardiac biomarkers. 'Community psychiatric nursing and the depressed elderly' has nothing to do with MI or biomarkers. 'Periodic solutions of population models in a periodically fluctuating environment' is a mathematical model that doesn't provide any information about MI or biomarkers. Finally, 'Solitary late recurrence of renal cell carcinoma presenting as duodenal ulcer' discusses cancer and does not mention MI or cardiac biomarkers. Therefore, we have to look outside the provided documents for relevant information.\n\nCardiac troponin T (cTnT) is a sensitive and specific marker for myocardial infarction (MI). It's released into the bloodstream within 2-4 hours after the onset of symptoms and remains elevated for several days. Troponin I has a similar profile, but it's more specific for MI.\n\nGiven this information, we can conclude that cardiac biomarkers like troponin T or troponin I are commonly used to diagnose MI.\n\nBased on our analysis, the correct answer is C: Troponin T\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
