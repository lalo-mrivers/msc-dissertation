["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about neuroimaging findings in a patient with tuberous sclerosis. We need to identify which option is NOT typically seen in the imaging of patients with this condition. Tuborous sclerosis is characterized by benign tumors called hamartomas, primarily affecting the brain and kidneys. Ependymoma is a type of tumor that can occur in the central nervous system, but it's not specifically associated with tuberous sclerosis. Subependymal nodules are a hallmark feature of neuroimaging in patients with tuberous sclerosis. Giant cell astrocytoma is also seen in some cases of tuberous sclerosis. White matter lesions are a common finding in various neurological conditions, including multiple sclerosis and stroke, but they're not specifically characteristic of tuberous sclerosis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
