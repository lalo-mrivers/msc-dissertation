["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the mean systolic blood pressure of elderly females. The given information is a mean value (125 mm Hg) and standard deviation (10). To find the answer, we need to determine the 95th percentile of this distribution. This can be done using the Z-score formula: Z = (x - μ) / σ, where x is the desired value (in this case, the 95th percentile), μ is the mean (125 mm Hg), and σ is the standard deviation (10). Solving for x, we get: x = μ + Z*σ. Using a Z-table or calculator, we find that the 95th percentile corresponds to a Z-score of approximately 1.65. Plugging this value into the formula, we get: x ≈ 125 + (1.65 * 10) ≈ 135 mm Hg.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
