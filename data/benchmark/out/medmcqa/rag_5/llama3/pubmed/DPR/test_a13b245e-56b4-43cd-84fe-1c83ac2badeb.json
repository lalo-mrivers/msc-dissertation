["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about augmentation of labor. We have to identify the statements that are false. The options provided relate to oxytocin use during augmentation of labor. Twin pregnancy precludes the use of oxytocin, which means it's true. Amniotomy decreases the need for oxytocin use, which also makes sense as it would help with labor progression. Methods of augmentation do increase the risk of operative management, such as cesarean section or forceps delivery, so this statement is false. Associated with a risk of uterine hyperstimulation is true, as excessive oxytocin use can cause this complication. Therefore, option C is the correct answer.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
