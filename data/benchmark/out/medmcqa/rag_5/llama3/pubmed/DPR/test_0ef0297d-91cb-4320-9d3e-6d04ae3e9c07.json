["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about protein synthesis of eukaryotes. We need to identify which option is not required for protein synthesis. RNA polymerase is responsible for DNA transcription into mRNA. Ribosomes are involved in translation, the process of building a polypeptide chain from amino acids. Peptidyl transferase is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in protein synthesis by facilitating peptide bond formation during translation. Amino acyl tRNA synthetase is not directly involved in protein synthesis as it is responsible for charging tRNAs with amino acids.\n\nBased on our understanding of the eukaryotic translation process, we can conclude that RNA polymerase and ribosomes are necessary components for protein synthesis. Peptidyl transferase is also essential as it facilitates peptide bond formation during translation.\n\nAmino acyl tRNA synthetase is involved in the process of amino acid activation but not directly in protein synthesis. Therefore, it is not required for eukaryotic protein synthesis.\", \n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
