["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about septic abortion with tricuspid valve endocarditis. Tricuspid valve endocarditis typically affects the right side of the heart. Given that it's likely to affect a vegetation from the valve, I would look for structures on the right side of the heart or in the vicinity. The lung is not directly affected by tricuspid valve endocarditis. Therefore, I can rule out option D: Lung. Brain and liver are also unlikely to be affected given the location of the endocarditis. Spleen is a possibility as it's a part of the spleno-cardiac axis, but it's less likely to be directly affected than the lung. Based on the information provided, I think the most likely option is B: Spleen.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
