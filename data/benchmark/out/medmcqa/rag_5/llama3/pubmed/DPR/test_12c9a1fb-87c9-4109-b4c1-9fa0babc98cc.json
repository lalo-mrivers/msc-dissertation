["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Since the question is about ductus-dependent blood flow, we need to look for information related to this concept. The provided documents do not explicitly discuss ductus-dependent blood flow or cardiac defects. However, we can identify relevant information that might help us answer the question. For example, document 4 discusses essential hypertension and its treatment, but it does not directly relate to cardiac defects or ductus-dependent blood flow. Document 1 mentions beta-adrenergic blockage and exercise-induced hyperventilation, which is unrelated to the question. Documents 2 and 3 discuss antibody responses and antibiotic resistance, respectively, neither of which is relevant to ductus-dependent blood flow. Therefore, we must carefully review each document to identify any indirect connections or clues that might help us answer the question.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
