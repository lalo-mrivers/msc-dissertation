["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Since the documents provided don't mention heart patients or pregnancy complications, we need to look for relevant information. The first document discusses osteochondromas, which is a rare cause of spinal pathology and neurological dysfunction. It doesn't provide any information about heart conditions during pregnancy.
