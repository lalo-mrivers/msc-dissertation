["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about antigenic drift. Antigenic drift refers to small changes in the surface antigens of an influenza virus over time. Influenza viruses are known for their ability to change and evolve, making it difficult to develop effective vaccines. Based on this information, I can eliminate options C and D as they do not relate to antigenic drift. Option A is also unlikely to be correct as antigenic drift affects both influenza type A and B. Therefore, the most likely option is B, which suggests that antigenic drift is a result of frame-shift mutation.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
