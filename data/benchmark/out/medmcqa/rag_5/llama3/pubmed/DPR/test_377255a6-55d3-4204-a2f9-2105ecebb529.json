["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about outlet forceps complications, which is a topic unrelated to the provided documents. However, let's examine each document to see if there's any relevant information. The first document discusses healthcare reform and restructuring, but it doesn't mention outlet forceps or childbirth. The second document is about a rare medical condition and doesn't provide any information on obstetric procedures. The third document talks about ethnicity as a study variable, which is also unrelated to the topic. The fourth document describes a teaching method for patients with acne, but it's not relevant to this question. Given that none of the documents provide relevant information, we can conclude that there's no direct connection between the documents and the question. Therefore, we must rely on our general medical knowledge to answer this question.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
