["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"None of the provided documents mention Actinomycin D or Vinblastine, which are names of chemotherapeutic agents. Therefore, it is not possible to determine if they are cell-specific or cycle/phase specific based on the provided information. However, we can make an educated guess that both Actinomycin D and Vinblastine are likely to be cell-cycle specific since they are used in chemotherapy. Additionally, Actinomycin D is a DNA-binding agent, which suggests it may have a more targeted effect on cells rather than being non-specific.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
