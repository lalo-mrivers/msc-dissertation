["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The paper 'Submicroscopic deletions at the WAGR locus...' talks about the WAGR (Wilms tumor, aniridia, genitourinary abnormalities, and mental retardation) locus. It mentions that there is a deletion including both the aniridia candidate gene (AN2) and the Wilms tumor predisposition gene (WT1). This suggests that the AN2 gene is related to aniridia. The HOX genes are not mentioned in this paper, but it's worth noting that the Pax-6 homologue is discussed as a strong candidate for the AN2 gene. This information doesn't seem directly relevant to the question about HOX gene and malformation.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
