["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The steps of intubation are a sequence of actions performed to ensure safe and effective insertion of an endotracheal tube into the patient's trachea. The first step is to prepare the patient by extending and flexing their neck (head extension and flexion of neck). Next, the laryngoscope is introduced into the patient's mouth to visualize the vocal cords. Then, the cuff of the endotracheal tube is inflated to prevent air leaks around the tube. After that, the breath sounds are checked using a stethoscope to ensure proper positioning of the tube. Finally, the tube is fixed in place to prevent dislodgement.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: CBAED\"\n}"]
