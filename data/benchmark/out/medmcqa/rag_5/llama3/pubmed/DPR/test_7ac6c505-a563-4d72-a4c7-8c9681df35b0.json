["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks for a wound that does not involve the dermis. The dermis is the layer of skin beneath the epidermis. It contains blood vessels, nerve endings, and hair follicles. An abrasion or contusion would likely involve the dermis, as they are types of wounds that can cause damage to this layer. A laceration could also potentially involve the dermis, especially if it is deep. An incision, however, is a surgical wound that is typically performed carefully and intentionally, so it is unlikely to involve the dermis in the same way as other types of wounds. Based on this analysis, an abrasion or contusion are not likely to meet the criteria specified in the question.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
