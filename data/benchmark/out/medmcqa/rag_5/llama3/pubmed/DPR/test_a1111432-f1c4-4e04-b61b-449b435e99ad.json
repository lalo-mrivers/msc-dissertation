["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about a specific syndrome that causes flushing, warmness, and perspiration on one side of the face after eating spicy food. The relevant document to consider is the section 'Restructuring the system will benefit all...' as it does not contain any information related to medical syndromes. The next document is 'Campaigning for change...', which also does not provide any information about the syndrome being asked. The third document is 'Maximum-likelihood estimation of current-dipole parameters for data obtained using multichannel magnetometer' and this document is completely unrelated to the question. The last two documents are 'Two root canals in a maxillary central incisor with enamel hypoplasia' and 'Applications of behavior to poultry management', but neither contains any information about a syndrome that causes flushing, warmness, and perspiration on one side of the face after eating spicy food. Therefore, the only remaining option is B: Auriculotemporal syndrome.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
