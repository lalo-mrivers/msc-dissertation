["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the Snellen chart, which is a standard visual acuity test. The patient's distance from the chart is 6 meters. Since this is a medical question and there are no relevant documents related to vision or the Snellen chart, we must look for information that might be indirectly applicable. We see that some of the documents discuss infections (e.g., gonorrhea), tumors, and amyloidosis, but none of these topics seem directly related to visual acuity or the Snellen chart. As a result, there is no relevant information in the provided documents that can help us answer this question.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
