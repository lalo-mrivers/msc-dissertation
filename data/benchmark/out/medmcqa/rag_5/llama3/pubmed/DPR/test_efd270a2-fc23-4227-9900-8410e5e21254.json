["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The formula for urea clearance is C = U x V/P. To determine what U denotes, we need to understand the meaning of each variable in the equation. C represents urea clearance, which is a measure of how well the kidneys are removing waste products from the blood. V represents urine volume per unit time (such as 24 hours). P represents plasma concentration, which is the amount of urea in the blood. Therefore, U must represent urinary excretion rate, which is the rate at which urea is eliminated in the urine.\", \"answer_choice\": B"]
