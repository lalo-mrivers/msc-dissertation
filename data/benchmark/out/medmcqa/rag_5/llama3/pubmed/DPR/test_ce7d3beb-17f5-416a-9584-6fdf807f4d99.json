["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presented with patchy hair loss in the right temporal and occipital region. The examination revealed non-scarring alopecia with multiple small broken hairs. Scrapings from scalp showed mild inflammation, peri-follicular hemorrhage and surrounding mild lymphocytic infiltration. Based on these findings, we can rule out scarring alopecias as they are characterized by the formation of scars rather than broken hairs. Non-scarring alopecias are also unlikely to cause inflammation, peri-follicular hemorrhage and lymphocytic infiltration in scalp scrapings. Therefore, we can focus on non-scarring alopecias that can cause hair breakage such as Alopecia Areata or Loose Anagen Hair.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
