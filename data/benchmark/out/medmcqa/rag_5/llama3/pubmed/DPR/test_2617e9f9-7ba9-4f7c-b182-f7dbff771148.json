["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about lymph from the tongue. Lymph is a clear fluid that helps to remove waste products and bacteria from the body. The main path for lymph drainage from the tongue is through the jugular vein, which is located in the neck. The vessels mentioned in this context are central, ventral, posterior, and marginal. Central refers to the area around the base of the brain, ventral refers to the area below the spinal cord, posterior refers to the back or rear of the body, and marginal refers to the edges or borders. Since lymph from the tongue is not drained by any of these vessels, I can conclude that it is actually drained through the jugular vein.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
