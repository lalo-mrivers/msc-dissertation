["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about glomerular capillaries. The oncotic pressure refers to the pressure exerted by proteins in the blood. In the case of glomerular capillaries, the fluid leaving the capillaries has a lower oncotic pressure because some proteins are filtered out. Option A is true.\n\nGlucose concentration is controlled by the kidneys and remains constant regardless of whether it's entering or leaving the capillaries. Option B is also true.\n\nConstriction of the afferent arteriole decreases blood flow to the glomerulus, not increases it. Option C is true.\n\nHematocrit refers to the percentage of red blood cells in a sample. Since the fluid leaving the capillaries has some plasma removed and more red blood cells are present in the entering fluid, option D is also true.\", \n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
