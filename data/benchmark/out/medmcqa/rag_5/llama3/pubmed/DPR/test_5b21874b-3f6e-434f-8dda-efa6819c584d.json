["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the effect of excessive forces of occlusion within physiological limits on periodontal ligament (PDL). The relevant document that provides insight into this topic is 'Teaching new acne patients with a customized slide sound program'. This document does not provide direct information about PDL. Therefore, we need to consider other relevant documents. 'Campaigning for change' and 'Periodic solutions of population models in a periodically fluctuating environment' do not provide any relevant information either. The only remaining document is 'Organs for transplantation. The Singapore experience.' This document does not provide information related to PDL or occlusion. Considering the available options, it seems that there is no direct correlation between excessive forces of occlusion and width of PDL. Hence, option C: Width will remain same appears to be the most plausible answer.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
