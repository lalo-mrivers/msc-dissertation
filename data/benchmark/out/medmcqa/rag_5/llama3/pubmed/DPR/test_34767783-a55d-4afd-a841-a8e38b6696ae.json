["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the type of joint that has the greatest movement. Amphiarthroses are joints that allow for slight gliding movements between adjacent bones. Diarthroses are also known as synovial joints and allow for greater freedom of movement, such as flexion, extension, rotation, and circumduction.
