["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Arterial gas analysis is a process of analyzing the gases present in arterial blood. It typically involves measuring pH, pCO2, and pO2 levels. Since the question is asking about maximum pCO2, we need to consider the stages of arterial gas analysis that relate to carbon dioxide levels. The relevant documents do not specifically mention arterial gas analysis or pCO2 levels, but they do discuss different types of hematomas and subdural hemorrhages. However, there is no connection between these topics and arterial gas analysis. Therefore, we can safely assume that the question is not related to the provided documents.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
