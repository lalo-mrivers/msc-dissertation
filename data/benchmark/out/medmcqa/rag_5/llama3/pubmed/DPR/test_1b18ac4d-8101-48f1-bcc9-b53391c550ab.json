["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Acetazolamide is a non-competitive inhibitor of carbonic anhydrase enzyme. This means it binds to the enzyme at a site other than the active site, preventing the enzyme from functioning. Carbonic anhydrase plays a crucial role in the production of aqueous humor in the eye. Inhibiting this enzyme would reduce the rate of aqueous humor production, which is beneficial for angle closure glaucoma patients as it reduces intraocular pressure. Therefore, the expected effect of Acetazolamide is to decrease Vmax (maximum velocity) of carbonic anhydrase.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
