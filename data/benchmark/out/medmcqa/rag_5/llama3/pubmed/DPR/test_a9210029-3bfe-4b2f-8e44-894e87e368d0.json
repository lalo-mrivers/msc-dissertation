["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided, we can conclude that hormone X is likely a thyroid hormone. The localization of the receptor in the nucleus suggests that it is a nuclear receptor, which is characteristic of thyroid hormones such as thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3). Adrenaline and insulin receptors are typically located on the surface of cells or in the cytoplasm, while FSH is a gonadotropin hormone with receptors found on the surface of target cells. Given the characteristics of hormone X, thyroxine seems to be the most likely candidate.\", \"answer_choice\": C}"]
