["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the most common extraradicular microorganism. None of the provided documents specifically mention this topic. However, I can infer that it might be related to bacteria that are commonly found outside the radiated area (extraradicularly). Upon reviewing the documents, I notice that one of them mentions Enterobacter osteomyelitis, which is a type of bacterial infection. This suggests that Enterobacter could be an extraradicular microorganism. Since there isn't any direct evidence to support this assumption, I will rely on my general knowledge and experience in medicine.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
