["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about a permanent tooth with fracture involving apical one-third of the root after treatment. The apical third refers to the tip of the root. Since it's a fracture and not an extraction, we can rule out option D (exfoliation). We also know that the fracture is near the apex, which could lead to internal resorption. Therefore, options A and B are possible. However, considering the location of the fracture, I believe that internal root resorption is more likely to occur.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
