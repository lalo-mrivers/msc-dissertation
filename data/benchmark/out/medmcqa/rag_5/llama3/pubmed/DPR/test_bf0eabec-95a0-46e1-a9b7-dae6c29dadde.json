["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Asphyxial injury is a condition that refers to the damage caused by a lack of oxygen supply to the brain or other vital organs. Since the question is asking about the characteristics of asphyxial injury in a term baby, I will focus on relevant medical literature. From the provided documents, none of them discuss asphyxial injury in babies. However, one document discusses midlife women's health and another discusses environmental health risks. Neither of these topics seem directly related to asphyxial injury. Therefore, I will consider the question standalone. Asphyxial injury is a well-known medical condition that can cause various symptoms such as seizures, altered sensorium, and difficulty in clearing oral secretions. Hypotonia (low muscle tone) is also a possible symptom of asphyxial injury. However, differential hypotonia (lower limbs > upper limbs) is not a characteristic of asphyxial injury.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
