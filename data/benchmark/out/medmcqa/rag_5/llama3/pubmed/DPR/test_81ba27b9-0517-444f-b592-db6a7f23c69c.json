["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Acetazolamide is a non-competitive inhibitor of carbonic anhydrase enzyme. This means it binds to the enzyme at a site other than the active site, which reduces the enzyme's activity. Carbonic anhydrase plays a crucial role in the production of aqueous humor, which increases intraocular pressure in angle closure glaucoma. By inhibiting carbonic anhydrase, acetazolamide will decrease the rate of aqueous humor production, thus reducing intraocular pressure. This is consistent with the expected effect of the drug in treating angle closure glaucoma.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
