["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the analytical study where population is the unit of study. Upon reviewing the provided documents, we can eliminate choices C (Case-control) and D (Cohort study) as they are both focused on comparing specific groups or populations over time, whereas this question seeks a broader perspective. Options A (Cross-sectional) and B (Ecological) remain as possibilities. In epidemiology and ecology, population refers to the collective group of individuals that can be studied for patterns and trends. Given that the study is focused on population models in a periodically fluctuating environment, we can infer that it's an ecological or population-level study. Hence, option B (Ecological) seems the most suitable choice.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
