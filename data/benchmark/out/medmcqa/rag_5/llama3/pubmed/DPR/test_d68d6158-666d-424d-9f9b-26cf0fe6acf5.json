["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about Zellweger syndrome, a genetic disorder. Based on the relevant documents, there are no direct mentions of glucose, lactic acid, triglycerides, or long chain fatty acids in relation to brain accumulation. However, chorea and ballism, which are discussed in one of the documents, can be caused by various conditions including metabolic abnormalities, neurodegenerative and immunologic disorders. Zellweger syndrome is a peroxisomal biogenesis disorder. Peroxisomes play a crucial role in beta-oxidation of long chain fatty acids. Therefore, it is likely that accumulation of long chain fatty acid occurs in the brain due to dysfunctional peroxisomes.\", \"answer_choice\": C}"]
