["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"This question is about the motor division of trigeminal nerve. The trigeminal nerve has three main divisions: ophthalmic, maxillary, and mandibular. Each division has its own specific motor and sensory functions. After analyzing the relevant documents, I found that none of the provided texts mention the trigeminal nerve or its divisions. Therefore, I will focus on general anatomy knowledge to answer this question. The motor division of the trigeminal nerve is responsible for controlling the muscles of mastication (chewing). The main muscle controlled by the mandibular division of the trigeminal nerve is the lateral pterygoid muscle, which comes out via the foramen ovale.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
