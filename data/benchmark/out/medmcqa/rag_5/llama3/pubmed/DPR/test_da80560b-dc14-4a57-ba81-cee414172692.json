["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is an 11-year-old child who has suffered a maxillary central incisor fracture. The tooth is vital and slightly mobile, indicating that the pulp is still intact. A radiographic examination shows a fracture at the apical third of the root. Given these findings, it's essential to consider the best course of treatment to minimize further damage or complications.\n\nFirstly, since the tooth is vital, immediate extraction is not necessary. Secondly, relieving the occlusion and splinting the tooth (option C) may help stabilize the fractured tooth and reduce the risk of further mobility, but it does not address the root fracture itself.\n\nIn this scenario, rendering palliative therapy (option A) might be a viable option if the goal is to manage symptoms and prevent further damage. However, considering the root fracture, it's essential to prioritize a more definitive treatment approach.\n\nGiven the information provided, performing immediate root canal treatment and splinting (option D) seems like the most logical choice. This would help address the root fracture, minimize the risk of complications, and potentially prevent further mobility or pulp necrosis.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
