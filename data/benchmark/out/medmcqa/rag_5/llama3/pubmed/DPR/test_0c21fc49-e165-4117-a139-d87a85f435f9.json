["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"A parametric test is a statistical test that assumes that the data follows a specific distribution (e.g. normal or Gaussian). The Pearson correlation, ANOVA, Student t-test are all parametric tests. A non-parametric test does not make this assumption and instead focuses on the rank order of the data. Upon reviewing the provided documents, none of the topics discussed relate to statistical testing or analysis. Therefore, I must rely on my general knowledge of statistics. Among the given options, Mann Whitney test is a non-parametric test that compares two groups without making any assumptions about their distribution.\", \"answer_choice\": C}"]
