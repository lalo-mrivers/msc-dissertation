["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the risk of recurrence in subsequent pregnancies if the father is a balanced translocation carrier. The key here is to identify the type of chromosomal abnormality involved and how it affects the transmission of the condition to offspring. Given that Kamlesh, the 2-year-old girl, has Down's syndrome with a karyotype of 21/21 translocation, we can infer that the father is also a carrier of the same translocation. This type of inheritance is consistent with autosomal dominant inheritance pattern.\n\nThe key concept here is that balanced carriers of a chromosomal translocation do not express the condition themselves but are at risk of transmitting it to their offspring. The risk of recurrence depends on the type of translocation and whether it is reciprocal or Robertsonian. In this case, since the karyotype shows 21/21 translocation, we can conclude that it's a Robertsonian translocation.\n\nAccording to literature, the risk of transmission from a balanced carrier parent is 50% for each subsequent pregnancy, regardless of the sex of the child. This is because the father, as a balanced carrier, has an equal chance of passing on either the normal or the abnormal chromosome to his offspring.\n\nTherefore, based on the available information and the given options, the correct answer is B: 50%\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
