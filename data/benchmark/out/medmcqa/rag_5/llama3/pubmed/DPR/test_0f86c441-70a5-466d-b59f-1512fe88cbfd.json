["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question presents a breastfed child with hypernatremia (Serum sodium > 170m Eq/L) and urine sodium of 70 mEq/L. This suggests that the child is losing more sodium through the kidneys than is being lost through the skin and gut, as breast milk provides adequate sodium intake. Given this scenario, I would rule out excessive intake of sodium (option D). Diabetes insipidus (option A) is unlikely due to the normal urine sodium level. Acute necrosis (option B) is not a common cause of hypernatremia in children. Severe dehydration (option C) is the most likely cause, as breastfed infants are generally at low risk for this condition.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
