["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Formalin is a fixative commonly used in biopsies to prevent autolysis (cell breakdown due to enzymatic reactions) by denaturing proteins and cross-linking with DNA. It's also effective in making tissue rigid, which helps with sectioning and handling during histological analysis. Additionally, formalin has antimicrobial properties that help kill microorganisms. The concentration of formalin is typically around 10%, not 2%. Therefore, the correct answer is D: 2% formaline is used.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
