["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the sustainer of inflammation of periapical tissue. No relevant information is provided in the given documents that would directly answer this question. However, I can try to think step-by-step and relate the information from the documents to come up with an educated guess. None of the documents mention periapical tissue or dental-related issues. The closest thing to inflammation is mentioned in 'Localized cutis marmorata telangiectatica congenita' where atrophy or ulceration may occur, but this is a rare congenital condition and not related to periapical tissue. Since no direct information is provided, I can look for general principles that could be applied. Inflammation often occurs due to microbial infections (C). Therefore, my educated guess would be that microorganisms (C) might sustain inflammation of the periapical tissue.\", \"answer_choice\": C}"]
