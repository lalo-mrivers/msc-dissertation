["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the storage temperature of a drug based on its label. The label says 'Store in a cool place', which suggests a moderate or low temperature. From the provided documents, there are no specific references to drug storage temperatures. However, we can rule out extreme temperatures such as -2 degree Celsius (very cold) and 8-15 degree Celsius (relatively warm). Based on common sense and typical storage conditions for most drugs, the 'cool place' likely refers to a temperature range between 0 and 2-8 degree Celsius. This is further supported by the fact that most pharmaceutical companies recommend storing medications at room temperature or slightly cooler temperatures.\", \"answer_choice\": C}"]
