["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To calculate the modified Bishop score, we need to consider the cervical dilatation (1 cm), effacement (30%), and station of the vertex (at -1). According to the relevant documents, a cervix 0-2 cm dilated is worth 0 points, 3-4 cm dilated is worth 2 points, and more than 4 cm dilated is worth 3 points. A cervix 30% effaced is considered moderate (2 points), and a vertex at -1 station means the pelvis is not well-favored (0 point). Therefore, the total modified Bishop score would be: 0 + 2 + 0 = 2.\", \"answer_choice\": B}"]
