["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about sequential arrangement of fetal scans. The relevant documents provided are unrelated to fetal scans or pregnancy, so I will focus on the general characteristics of fetal scan arrangements. A typical sequence of fetal scans includes a growth scan (also known as an anomaly scan) that checks for any abnormalities, followed by a non-stress test (NST) and a Doppler ultrasound to measure the baby's movements and blood flow.

Triple marker refers to a combination of tests used in prenatal screening, but it is not directly related to the sequential arrangement of scans.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
