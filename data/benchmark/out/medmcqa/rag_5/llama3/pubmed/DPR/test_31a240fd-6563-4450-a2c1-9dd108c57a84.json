["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking which of the given options is not used in polymerase chain reaction. We need to analyze each option to determine if it is related to PCR or not.\\nOption A: DNA Polymerase - This is the enzyme responsible for synthesizing new strands of DNA during PCR, so it's definitely involved.\\nOption B: Taq polymerase - This is a type of DNA polymerase specifically designed for PCR, also involved.\\nOption C: Dideoxyribonucleotides - These are nucleotides that contain no hydroxyl (-OH) group and are used as chain terminators in the sequencing reaction during PCR, so they're related.\\nOption D: DNA template - This is a necessary component of PCR, where you need a template strand to act as a starting point for DNA synthesis.\\nFrom this analysis, we can conclude that all options except one are directly or indirectly involved in PCR. The only option not used in PCR is... \\n\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
