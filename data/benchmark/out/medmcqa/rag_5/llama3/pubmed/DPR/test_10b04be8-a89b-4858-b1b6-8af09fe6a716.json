["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the major mechanism of transport of drugs across biological membranes. Based on the provided documents, none of the given options are directly related to the distribution of vanadium in tissues or the mechanisms of HIV infection, corticotropin stimulation testing, or T-lymphocyte subsets. Therefore, we need to consider general information about transportation mechanisms. Passive diffusion is a type of transport where molecules move from an area of higher concentration to an area of lower concentration without any energy input. Facilitated diffusion involves carrier proteins that facilitate the movement of molecules across biological membranes. Active transport requires ATP energy and moves molecules against their concentration gradient. Endocytosis is a process of internalization of substances into cells. Considering these mechanisms, we can conclude that the major mechanism of transport of drugs across biological membranes is likely to be one of the above options.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A: Passive diffusion\""]
