Filarial worms are a type of parasitic worm that causes diseases such as elephantiasis, lymphedema, and onchocerciasis. The question asks which option is responsible for diseases in all except one. Based on my knowledge, I will review each option: Brugia malayi causes elephantiasis and lymphedema, Onchocerca volvulus causes onchocerciasis and river blindness, Mansonella ozzardi causes loiasis, and Wuchereria bancrofti causes lymphedema and elephantiasis. The only disease that is not mentioned in the options is gestational hypertension, which is a condition caused by Pregnancy toxemia.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
