["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking how to remove centric interference. Centric interference refers to the phenomenon where chromosomes that are identical or very similar in size and structure interact with each other during mitosis, leading to problems with chromosome segregation. Mik1 and Wee1 cooperate to inhibit the tyrosine phosphorylation of Cdc2. This has no direct relevance to removing centric interference. Nursing perspectives on health education do not provide any relevant information either. The study on surface marker expression in acute myeloid leukaemia is also unrelated. First and second cycle egg production characteristics in commercial table egg flocks, as well as cloning of GT box-binding proteins, do not provide any relevant insights either.\n\nThe key to removing centric interference lies in the characteristics of chromosomes themselves. Since this is a question about reducing centric interference, it is likely that the correct answer has something to do with the structure or composition of chromosomes. Among the provided options, the only one that seems relevant is B: Central fossa. This refers to the central depression on the surface of an achromatic chromosome. Centric interference occurs when two identical or very similar chromosomes interact with each other during mitosis.\n\nIn this context, removing centric interference would mean reducing the interaction between these chromosomes by altering their structure or composition. The central fossa might play a role in this process, possibly by affecting the way chromosomes interact with each other.\n\nThe option C: Both of the above is incorrect because there is no mention of supporting cusps being related to centric interference removal. Option D: None is also incorrect because one of the options (B) could be relevant.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
