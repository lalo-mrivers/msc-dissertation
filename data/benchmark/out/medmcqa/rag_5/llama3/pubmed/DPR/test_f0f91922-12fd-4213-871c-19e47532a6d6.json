["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about comparing the data of two groups of newborns based on whether their mothers received food supplements or not. This implies that we are dealing with categorical data (newborns who did receive food supplements vs. those who didn't). The type of test used for categorical data depends on the nature of the outcome variable (weight in this case, which is continuous). Since the outcome variable is continuous, we need a non-parametric test or a parametric test that assumes normality. Chi square test can be used to compare two independent groups with nominal outcome variables. However, since the outcome variable is continuous and not nominal, Student's T-test would be more appropriate if the assumptions of equal variance and normal distribution are met. Fisher exact test is typically used for contingency tables when expected frequencies are low. Paired T-test is used for paired data, which is not applicable in this case.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"]
