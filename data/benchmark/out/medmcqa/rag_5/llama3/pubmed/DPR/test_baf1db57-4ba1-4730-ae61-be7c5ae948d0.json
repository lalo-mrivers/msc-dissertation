["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about Dummer's classification, which is related to the anatomy of the midline cervical cleft. Since there are no relevant documents provided that discuss Dummer's classification or apical constriction, we need to look for any mention of these terms in the given texts. Upon reviewing the documents, we find that the term 'apical' is mentioned in the context of radial forearm free flap with double skin island. This suggests that apical constriction might be related to this surgical technique. However, since Dummer's classification is not explicitly mentioned in any of the provided documents, we need to rely on our general knowledge and research skills to answer this question. Unfortunately, there are no relevant texts available to provide a definitive answer.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
