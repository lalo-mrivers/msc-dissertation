["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about a psychiatrist's posting. There is no relevant information provided about aponeurotic repair of inguinal hernia or compound-curved needles for vascular surgery. Exomphalos, inguinal hernia, renal agenesis, skeletal dysplasia, heart disease are discussed in the article 'Exomphalos, inguinal hernia, renal agenesis, skeletal dysplasia, heart disease--a \"new\" syndrome?' but this has no relevance to psychiatry. Computer viruses being a threat for healthcare professionals is also unrelated. The topic of immunity and genetics relating to control of parasitic zoonoses does not seem relevant either. Therefore, we need to look at the general categories where psychiatrists are posted. Primary Health Centres (PHC) are usually equipped with basic medical facilities and may or may not have a psychiatrist. Military hospitals generally do not have psychiatric units as they focus on treating military personnel's physical injuries. District hospitals may have some specialized services like cardiology or neurology but it is unlikely to have a dedicated psychiatric unit. Hospitals with medical colleges often have separate departments for various specialities including psychiatry.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
