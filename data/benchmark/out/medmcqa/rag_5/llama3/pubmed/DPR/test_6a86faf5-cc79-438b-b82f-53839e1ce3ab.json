["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the role of barrier membrane in GTR. The documents provided are case reports and research articles on various medical topics. None of these documents explicitly discuss the role of barrier membranes in GTR. Therefore, it is necessary to look for any information related to bone grafting or tissue repair that might provide a hint about the role of barrier membrane. After reviewing all the documents, I found that none of them contain relevant information. Hence, I will rely on general knowledge and consider the functions of barrier membranes in various medical procedures. Barrier membranes are often used in GTR (guided tissue regeneration) to protect the underlying tissues from infection and promote healing by preventing epithelial migration and promoting tissue integration.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: To prevent the underlying tissues from the infection\""]
