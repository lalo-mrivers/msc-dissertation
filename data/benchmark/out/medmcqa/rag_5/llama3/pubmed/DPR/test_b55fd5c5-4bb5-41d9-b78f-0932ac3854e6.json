["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the population that falls between the median and the median plus one standard deviation in a normal distribution. This is equivalent to asking for 68% of the data points since the area under a normal curve between the mean (median) and one standard deviation is approximately 68%. Therefore, we can conclude that 0.68 of the population falls between the median and the median plus one standard deviation.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
