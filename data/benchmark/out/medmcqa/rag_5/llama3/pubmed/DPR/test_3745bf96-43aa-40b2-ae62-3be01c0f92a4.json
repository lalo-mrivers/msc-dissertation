["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with a spontaneous abortion and secondary amenorrhea since then. FSH is found to be 6 IU/mL, which is within the normal range (normal FSH level: 5-21 IU/mL). This suggests that the ovary is functioning normally. The patient has not had an ongoing pregnancy, as she has had a spontaneous abortion.
