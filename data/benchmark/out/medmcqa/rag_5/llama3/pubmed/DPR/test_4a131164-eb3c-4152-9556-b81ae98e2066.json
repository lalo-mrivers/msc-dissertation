["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the indications for evisceration. None of the provided documents discuss evisceration or its indications. The first document is about renal cell carcinoma and Reiter's syndrome, which does not relate to evisceration. The second document discusses population models and has no relevance to surgery.
