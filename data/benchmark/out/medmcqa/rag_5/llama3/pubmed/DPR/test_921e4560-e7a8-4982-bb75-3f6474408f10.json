["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Shock is a life-threatening medical condition that requires prompt recognition and treatment. There are different types of shock, including hypovolemic shock (caused by blood loss), cardiogenic shock (caused by heart failure), septic shock (caused by infection), and anaphylactic shock (caused by allergic reaction). The common feature among all these types is the decreased blood flow to the vital organs, which leads to inadequate oxygen delivery. This decreased blood flow is characterized by hypotension, not vasoconstriction. Vasoconstriction would actually increase blood pressure, whereas in shock, it decreases. Bradycardia (slow heart rate) may occur in some types of shock, but it's not a common feature among all types. Therefore, the correct answer is B: Hypotension.\", \"answer_choice\": B}"]
