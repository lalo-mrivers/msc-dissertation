["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 36-week gestation female with hypertension, blurring of vision, and headache. The blood pressure readings are concerningly high (180/120 mm Hg and 174/110 mm Hg after 20 minutes). Considering the documents provided, there is no direct relevance to glycogen levels in rat ova, plasma expanders, immunosuppressive agents, or penicillin penetration into human phagocytes. The closest relevant document is [The effect of beta adrenergic blockade upon exercise-induced changes in blood coagulation and fibrinolysis], but it does not provide direct guidance for managing hypertension in a pregnant patient.\n\nHowever, considering the general guidelines for managing hypertension during pregnancy, I would prioritize the patient's safety. The increasing blood pressure readings suggest a need for urgent management. The patient should be admitted to the hospital for close monitoring and treatment of her hypertension.\n\nGiven the severity of her condition, it is reasonable to consider starting antihypertensives and magnesium sulfate (MgSO4) to reduce the risk of complications such as eclampsia or placental abruption. Termination of the pregnancy may be considered in severe cases, but it is not the primary management approach.\n\nOral antihypertensives may not be sufficient for a patient with such elevated blood pressure readings and concerns about vision blurring and headaches.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
