["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the maximum penetration among the given options. The context is medical imaging, so we need to find a relevant concept related to radiation. Alpha, beta, and gamma rays are types of ionizing radiation with different energies. Electron beam is not a type of ionizing radiation, but rather a type of radiation used in medical treatments like cancer therapy.\n\nConsidering the medical contexts provided (e.g., CT scan findings), we can conclude that gamma rays have the maximum penetration among the given options.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
