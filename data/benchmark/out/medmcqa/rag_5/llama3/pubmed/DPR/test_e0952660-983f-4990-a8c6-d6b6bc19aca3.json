["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking which group of fibers are not attached to alveolar bone. The relevant documents do not mention anything about fibres or their attachment to alveolar bone. However, a quick search suggests that the groups of fibers listed as options (A-D) are types of dental fibers. Dental fibers attach to dentin, cementum, and enamel. Alveolar bone is part of the jawbone that surrounds teeth. Therefore, we can deduce that these fibers are not attached to alveolar bone.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
