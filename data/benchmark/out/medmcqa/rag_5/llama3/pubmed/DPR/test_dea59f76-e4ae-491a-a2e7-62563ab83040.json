["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient underwent a tonsillectomy at 6 years old with no complications. This suggests that the child had normal coagulation function at that age. Later, at 12 years old, the patient had a prolonged partial thromboplastin time but a normal prothrombin time. This is consistent with Vitamin K deficiency, as Vitamin K plays a role in the production of clotting factors and the partial thromboplastin time is sensitive to these factors.
