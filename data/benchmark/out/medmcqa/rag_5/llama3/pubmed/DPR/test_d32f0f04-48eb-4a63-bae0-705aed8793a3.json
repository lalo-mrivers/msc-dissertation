["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"This question is about the process of eukaryotic mRNA binding to ribosomes. The relevant documents provided are related to pharmacology, immunology, and biochemistry. There is no information that directly relates to the topic of this question.\n\nThe key to answering this question correctly is to recall basic biological concepts. Eukaryotic mRNA binds to ribosomes through a specific sequence called the Shine-Dalgarno sequence. This sequence is found in the 5' untranslated region (UTR) of eukaryotic mRNAs and provides a binding site for ribosomal subunits.\n\nThe provided documents do not mention capping, poly-A tail, or tRNA as factors that facilitate mRNA-ribosome binding. Therefore, we can confidently choose D: Shine-Dalgarno sequence as the correct answer.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
