["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the inhibition of enzymes in the heme biosynthetic pathway due to lead poisoning. This leads to the accumulation of a certain substance in blood. The options provided are related to porphyrins, which are involved in heme biosynthesis. Porphob I inogen and uroporphyrinogen III are both precursors in the heme biosynthetic pathway. Ferrochelatase is an enzyme that catalyzes the final step in heme synthesis. Delta amino levulinic acid is a precursor to porphobilinogen, which is then converted to uroporphyrinogen I and III. Therefore, the accumulation of substance in blood due to lead poisoning would be related to the inhibition of ferrochelatase or delta amino levulinic acid.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
