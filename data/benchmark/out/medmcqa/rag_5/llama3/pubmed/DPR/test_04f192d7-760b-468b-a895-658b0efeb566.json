["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking to arrange the sequence of auditory pathway from peripheral to central. The options provided are a series of brain regions involved in hearing. Starting with the most peripheral structure, the cochlear nucleus is responsible for processing sound waves in the inner ear.
