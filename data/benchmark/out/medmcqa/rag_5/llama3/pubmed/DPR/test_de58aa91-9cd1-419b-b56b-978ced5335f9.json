["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Von-Gierk's disease is a genetic disorder that affects glucose metabolism. It's characterized by an impairment of glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis. In this context, ketosis occurs when the body uses alternative energy sources such as fatty acids and ketone bodies due to impaired glycolysis. Considering the pathophysiology of Von-Gierk's disease, we can deduce that hypoglycemia would be a common finding, not low blood sugar levels (option B is incorrect). Oxaloacetate plays a crucial role in gluconeogenesis, which is impaired in Von-Gierk's disease, so option C is correct. As for fat mobilization, it's actually increased in response to ketosis as the body uses fatty acids as an energy source.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
