["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"This question is about a statistical analysis of blood pressure data. The provided information helps to understand the distribution of blood pressures among the 200 persons. Since the first quartile (Q1) is 94 mm Hg and the third quartile (Q3) is 110 mm, we can determine the interquartile range (IQR). The IQR will be useful for finding the fourth quartile (Q4), which represents the upper boundary of the desired interval.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the IQR: Q3 - Q1 = 110 mm - 94 mm = 16 mm. Now, to find the Q4, we can add half of the IQR to Q3: Q4 = Q3 + (IQR/2) = 110 mm + 8 mm = 118 mm.\n\nFinally, since the first quartile is 94 mm and the fourth quartile is 118 mm, we are looking for patients with blood pressures within this interval. This can be achieved by subtracting the lower bound from the upper bound: Q4 - Q1 = 118 mm - 94 mm = 24 mm.\n\nWe know that approximately 25% of the data falls below the first quartile and 75% of the data falls above the third quartile. Since we are looking for patients with blood pressures between the 3rd and 4th quartiles, this corresponds to about 50% of the total population (200 persons). Therefore, we need to find the proportion of the data that lies within this interval.\n\nThe problem statement does not provide information about the distribution of the data. However, we can assume a roughly symmetric distribution around the median (Q2) because there is no reason to believe otherwise. Since the interquartile range provides an estimate of the distance between Q1 and Q3, it also gives us an idea of the spread around the median.\n\nBased on this assumption, approximately 25% of the data will lie below the first quartile (Q1) and another 25% above the third quartile (Q3). This leaves about 50% of the data within the interval between Q3 and Q4. Within this interval, roughly half of the remaining data points should fall below the median (Q2), while the other half should lie above the median.\n\nNow, we can use these proportions to estimate the number of patients with blood pressures between the 3rd and 4th quartiles:\n\n25% below Q1 + 50% within the interval = 75%\n\nWe need to find the proportion of patients that lies within this interval. Since about 75% of the data falls within the lower bound (Q1) and upper bound (Q4), we can use the following proportion:\n\nPercentage of patients with BP between Q3 and Q4 â‰ˆ 50%\n\nThis corresponds to approximately 25% of the total population, which is equivalent to 200 persons * 0.25 = 50 patients.\n\nSo, the answer choice B: 50 is correct.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
