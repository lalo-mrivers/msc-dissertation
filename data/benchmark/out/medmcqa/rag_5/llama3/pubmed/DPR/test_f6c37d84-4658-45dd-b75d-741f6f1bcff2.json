["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Since we are discussing voluntary movements and Golgi tendon organ's role during such movements, it is important to understand what information this sensory receptor provides to the nervous system. According to various sources, Golgi tendon organs continuously monitor muscle tension and send feedback signals to the efferent neurons. This implies that the organ detects changes in muscle force rather than other parameters like muscle length or joint angle.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
