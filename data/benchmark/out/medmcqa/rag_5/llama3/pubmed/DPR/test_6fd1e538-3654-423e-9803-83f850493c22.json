["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"At resting membrane potential, the equilibrium potentials of X and Y are -30mV and -40mV. This means that ions X and Y have a higher concentration outside the cell compared to inside the cell. The cell membrane is freely permeable to these ions, which allows them to pass through the membrane.\n\nIf a drug is infused that can block the permeability of Z, it will not affect the permeability of X and Y. Since there is no change in the permeability of X and Y, the equilibrium potentials of X and Y remain -30mV and -40mV respectively.\n\nThe resting membrane potential is determined by the balance between the equilibrium potentials of ions X, Y, and Z. If the blockage of Z does not affect the equilibrium potentials of X and Y, there will be no change in the resting membrane potential.\", \"answer_choice\": C}"]
