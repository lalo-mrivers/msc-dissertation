["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about chemotactic cytokine. Chemotaxis refers to the migration of cells towards a chemical signal. Based on the given documents, we can infer that alpha-adrenergic receptors are involved in renin secretion and have an effect on antigen-induced DNA synthesis.
