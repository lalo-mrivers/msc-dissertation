["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about adrenocorticosteroids. The relevant documents are from the fields of medicine, but none of them specifically mention the effects of adrenocorticosteroids on bone density. However, one document mentions beta-adrenergic receptors and their regulation in rat cerebral cortex. This could be related to the question, as adrenocorticosteroids can affect the nervous system. A closer look at the documents reveals that one document discusses the effect of beta adrenergic blockade upon exercise-induced changes in blood coagulation and fibrinolysis. It mentions an increase in plasma adrenaline and noradrenaline concentration during exercise under beta blockade. This could be related to the question, as adrenocorticosteroids can affect the production of these hormones.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
