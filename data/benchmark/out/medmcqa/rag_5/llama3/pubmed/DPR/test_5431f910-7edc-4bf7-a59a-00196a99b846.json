["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the risk of endocarditis. Endocarditis is an infection of the inner lining of the heart (endocardium). The lesions mentioned are all types of congenital heart defects that can increase the risk of endocarditis. A study on endocarditis suggests that patients with unrepaired VSD, MR, and AR have a higher risk of developing endocarditis compared to those with ASD who tend to have a lower risk due to the lack of turbulent blood flow. Therefore, based on the available information, ASD is less likely to increase the risk of endocarditis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
