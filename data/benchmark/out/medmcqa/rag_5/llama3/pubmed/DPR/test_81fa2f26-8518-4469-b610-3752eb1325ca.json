["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the properties of cobalt chromium crown reconstruction during soldering. The sudden increase in temperature will likely affect the mechanical properties of the material. Cobalt chromium alloys are known for their high strength and resistance to corrosion. Upon heating, the alloy's yield strength and percent elongation may change due to changes in its crystal structure and internal stresses.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C: Yield strength increases and percent elongation decreases\""]
