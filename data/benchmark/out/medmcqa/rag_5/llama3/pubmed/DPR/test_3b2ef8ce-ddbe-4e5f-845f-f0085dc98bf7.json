["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The term anxiolysis refers to a state of reduced anxiety. It is often used as a precursor to sedation, hence the continuum to sedation. Conscious sedation is a form of sedation that allows patients to still respond to verbal commands and maintain their airway. Deep sedation is typically defined as a level of sedation where patients are unable to respond to verbal commands or maintain their airway without assistance.
