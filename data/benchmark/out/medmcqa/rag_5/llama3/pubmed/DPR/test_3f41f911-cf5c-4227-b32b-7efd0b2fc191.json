["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Midazolam is a benzodiazepine with anxiolytic and sedative properties. According to the relevant documents, there are no indications that midazolam has been discussed or its administration routes described. However, based on general knowledge about midazolam's pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties, it is unlikely that oral administration would be effective due to first-pass metabolism. Inhalation is not a common route of administration for midazolam, and the available information does not support this option. Intra muscular injection is also unlikely as midazolam has a poor bioavailability when administered parenterally. Therefore, the most plausible answer is that midazolam cannot be given by oral or inhalation routes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
