["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the release of synaptic vesicle from presynaptic terminal. The options provided are related to the process of neurotransmission. I will analyze each option carefully. Option A seems unrelated as it refers to conduction of nerve impulse, which is a different stage in neurotransmission. Options B and C both refer to ion channels and influx of ions, but they seem to be referring to separate processes. Therefore, I need to focus on the release of synaptic vesicle from presynaptic terminal. This process requires calcium influx into the terminal. Hence, Option C: Prevention of calcium influx is the most likely explanation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"]
