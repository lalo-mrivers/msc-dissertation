["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To calculate the base deficit, we need to first calculate the expected HCO3- level. The formula is: HCO3- (expected) = 0.03 x weight + 15. This gives us an expected HCO3- of 22.5. Then, we subtract the measured HCO3- from the expected value: base deficit = 22.5 - 6 = 16.75. Since this is in mmol/L and the question asks for mEq, we multiply by 1 to get the answer.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
