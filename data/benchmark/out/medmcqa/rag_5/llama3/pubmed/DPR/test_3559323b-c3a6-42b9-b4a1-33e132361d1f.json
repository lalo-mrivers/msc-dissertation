["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"After reviewing the provided documents, I did not find any information related to parotidectomy or numbness on shaving. However, I can try to think step-by-step based on my knowledge of medical concepts. Parotidectomy is a surgical procedure that involves removing part or all of the parotid gland. After reviewing the options, I noticed that the facial nerve runs close to the parotid gland and is responsible for supplying sensation to the face, including the skin around the mouth and chin. Shaving after parotidectomy could potentially cause numbness due to injury to this nerve. Therefore, my step-by-step thinking suggests that the correct answer might be A: Facial nerve.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
