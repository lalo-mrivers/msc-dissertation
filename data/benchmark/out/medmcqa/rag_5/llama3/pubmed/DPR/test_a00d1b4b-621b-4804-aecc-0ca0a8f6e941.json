["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Since the question is about the composition of Buccopharyngeal membrane, I will look for relevant information from the provided documents. Upon reviewing the documents, I found that there are no direct mentions of Buccopharyngeal membrane in any of them. However, one document talks about midline cervical cleft which involves three different germ-cell components including cartilage, striated muscles, small salivary glands, and nerves. This information does not directly relate to the composition of Buccopharyngeal membrane either. As a result, I will consider general embryological knowledge. The Buccopharyngeal membrane is a structure that develops during embryonic development, specifically from the endoderm and ectoderm layers. Therefore, the correct answer should include both AB as options.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: Both AB\""]
