["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The woman is experiencing obstructed labour, which is a life-threatening condition for both the mother and the child. Given that fetal demise has been confirmed, the primary concern becomes the management of the maternal condition to prevent further complications. Dehydration is also a significant issue, as it can exacerbate obstetric complications. In this scenario, the goal is to facilitate delivery while minimizing risk to the mother's health.\n\nGiven the absence of viable fetal life, the need for a live birth is no longer a primary consideration. Instead, the focus shifts to ensuring the mother's safety and preventing further complications. Cesarean section would be an appropriate management option in this case, as it allows for the delivery of the fetus while minimizing maternal risk.\n\nThe other options do not align with the given scenario.
