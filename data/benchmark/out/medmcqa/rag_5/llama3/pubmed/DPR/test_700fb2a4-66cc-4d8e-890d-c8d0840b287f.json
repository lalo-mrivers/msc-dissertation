["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Tracheostomy is a surgical procedure that creates an opening in the trachea to facilitate airway management. It reduces respiratory resistance by providing a direct path for airflow into the lungs. This can be particularly helpful for patients with respiratory conditions or those who require mechanical ventilation. Dead air space, on the other hand, refers to the space within the lungs where air does not participate in gas exchange. Tracheostomy would not increase dead air space. Furthermore, obstruction in respiration is unlikely due to the creation of a direct airflow path. Therefore, C: Decrease respiratory work is the most plausible option.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"]
