["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about unconjugated bilirubin. Unconjugated bilirubin is a normal metabolite of hemoglobin degradation. Increased levels can be seen in various conditions such as hemolytic anemia, where there is increased breakdown of red blood cells. However, we are looking for the exception here. Crigler-Najjar syndrome and Gilbert syndrome are both inherited disorders that affect bilirubin metabolism, but they do not directly relate to hemolytic anemia.
