["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about direct pulp capping. The relevant information is provided in the documents. After reviewing the texts, I found that there is no mention of direct pulp capping or its contraindications in the given documents. Therefore, I will rely on general knowledge and standard dental practices to answer this question. Direct pulp capping is not recommended when there is mechanical exposure, as it can lead to further irritation and complications. Pinpoint exposure may also not be suitable for direct pulp capping, as it can still cause pulp stimulation. Carious exposure with more than 1 mm in size would typically require a more extensive treatment, such as removal of the decayed tissue, making direct pulp capping less appropriate.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
