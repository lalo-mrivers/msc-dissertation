["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is experiencing infertility with a normal female partner. The male partner has a semen volume of 0.8 mL per ejaculate on two repeated samples, which suggests oligozoospermia. Additionally, there is absent fructose and no sperm observed under the microscope, indicating azoospermia. Given these findings, I will focus on identifying any underlying anatomical or physiological causes that may be contributing to the low semen quality.\n\nThe first step would be to evaluate the patient's ejaculatory ducts to determine if they are patent and functioning properly. A per-rectal examination (A) would allow me to assess the presence of seminal vesicles, which produce fructose, and the prostate gland, which is responsible for adding seminal fluid to the semen.\n\nThe absence of fructose suggests that there may be a blockage or obstruction in the ejaculatory ducts, making option A the most relevant choice.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
