["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the options of treatment for SCC (squamous cell carcinoma) present on the lateral margin of the tongue in staging T2N0. From a medical perspective, SCC on the tongue usually requires surgical intervention and/or radiation therapy. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines recommend that patients with T2 tongue cancer undergo surgery to resect the primary tumor and involved lymph nodes. For stage T2N0, it is likely that the lymph nodes in levels I-IV are affected.\n\nFrom this information, we can deduce that options B, C, or D are plausible choices for treatment. However, option A (SOHND) seems less likely as it only involves removing lymph nodes in levels I-II, which may not be sufficient for a T2 tumor.\n\nTherefore, the most likely correct answer is either B, C, or D.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
