["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about a 10-year-old girl with fever, convulsions, neck rigidity, and CSF findings that show protein 150 mg, sugar 40 mg, chloride 2500 mg. The presence of lymphadenopathy suggests an infectious process. Based on the symptoms and laboratory findings, we can eliminate options C (Cryptococcal meningitis) and D (Tuberculous meningitis), as they are typically associated with chronic or slowly progressive infections. Option A (Viral meningitis) is a possibility but does not fully explain the presence of lymphadenopathy. Option B (Pyogenic meningitis) is the most likely diagnosis given the CSF findings, which are consistent with a bacterial infection.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
