["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about cephalosporin active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. There are no documents directly mentioning Cephalosporins or Pseudomonas aeruginosa. However, we have some information about antibiotics and antifungals. The [Value of epicillin and ampicillin in the treatment of meningococcal and pneumococcal meningitis] document mentions Epicillin and Ampicillin as effective single drugs against Neisseria meningitidis and Diplococcus pneumoniae. Since Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a different type of bacteria, we need to look for another clue. The [Ramipril: A review of the new ACE inhibitor] document does not mention Pseudomonas aeruginosa or Cephalosporins. However, it mentions Ramipril as a long-acting angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor with a long elimination half-life. There is no connection between this information and the question.\n\nThe [Complications of local anesthetics] document does not provide any relevant information for this question. The [Blastomycotic cranial osteomyelitis] document mentions Blastomyces dermatitidis, which causes a systemic pyogranulomatous disease that primarily manifests itself in the skin, bones, pulmonary, and genitourinary systems.\n\nThe only remaining clue is the [Effect of beta-adrenergic blockaders on the uterine musculature of rats] document, which mentions Pindolol, Propranolol, and Practolol as beta-adrenergic blockers. However, this information does not provide any connection to Cephalosporins or Pseudomonas aeruginosa.\n\nAfter reviewing all the documents, we can conclude that none of the provided cephalosporin options (A: Cefoperazone, B: Cefaclor, C: Ceftriaxone, D: Cefotaxime) are directly mentioned in the given texts. Therefore, we need to look for other sources or information outside these documents to answer this question.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"None of the above (not A/B/C/D)\""]
