["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the relationship between the primary target (the vital pulp) and the secondary target. Since the primary target is the vital pulp, it is related to dental or oral health issues. The provided documents do not specifically discuss the increased binding of proteins, so we need to think more broadly about the topic. From the document '[Relationship between vital pulp and deep periodontal pockets]', we can infer that there is a connection between the vital pulp and periodontal pockets.
