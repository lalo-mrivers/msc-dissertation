["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the storage of drug in the tissues. The relevant documents are cases reports and not directly related to this topic. However, we can use our general knowledge of pharmacokinetics to approach this question. Storage of drug in the tissues implies that the volume of distribution (Vd) of the drug is large. This is because Vd represents the amount of drug that gets distributed in the tissues and organs. A larger Vd indicates that more of the drug is stored in the tissues, which is consistent with the concept of storage. Therefore, we can infer that a large volume of distribution is related to the storage of drug in the tissues.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
