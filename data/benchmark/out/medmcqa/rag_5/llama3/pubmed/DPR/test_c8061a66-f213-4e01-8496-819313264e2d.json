["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The provided documents do not contain information related to acrylic resin mixtures or excessive incorporation of monomers. However, we can look for general principles that may be applicable. The main concern when incorporating monomers into a mixture is the potential for improper polymerization, which could lead to issues with the final product's properties. In this case, an excessive amount of monomer might result in an imbalance of the polymerization process, leading to unintended consequences.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
