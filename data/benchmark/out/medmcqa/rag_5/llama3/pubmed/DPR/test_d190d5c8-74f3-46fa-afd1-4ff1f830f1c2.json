["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about fresh frozen plasma (FFP). We need to review the documents provided to find information related to FFP. The first document 'Organs for transplantation' does not mention FFP. The second document 'Paratibial fasciotomy' is also irrelevant as it discusses a surgical approach to treat venous leg ulcers. The third document 'Cellular aging and senescence' provides information on cellular senescence, but it does not relate to FFP. The fourth document 'Giant broad ligament leiomyoma' reports a rare case of fibroid, but there is no mention of FFP. We need to look for information that is relevant to the question. Upon reviewing the documents again, we can see that none of them provide information on the usage of FFP. Therefore, we cannot find any information in the provided documents that supports or contradicts each option.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
