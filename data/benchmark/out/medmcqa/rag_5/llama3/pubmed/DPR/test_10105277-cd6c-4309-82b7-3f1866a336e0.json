["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about what stimulus triggers the respiratory center. The relevant documents provided don't mention anything about the respiratory center or its stimulation. However, we can look at the physiology of breathing. A normal feedback mechanism in the body is that an increase in CO2 level stimulates the respiratory center to breathe more deeply and rapidly to exhale the excess CO2. Therefore, it's likely that an increase in arterial carbon dioxide level would be the best stimulator of the respiratory centre.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
