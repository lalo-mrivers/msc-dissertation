["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about a pregnant lady who acquires chickenpox 3 days prior to delivery. The delivery is by normal vaginal route. The relevant documents provided are case reports and studies on laparoscopic cholecystectomy, organ transplantation, and consequences of routine gastroscopy before cholecystectomy. None of these documents specifically address the topic of varicella (chickenpox) in pregnancy. Therefore, we need to look for general information on varicella in pregnant women.\n\nAccording to CDC guidelines, women who develop chickenpox within 20 days of delivery should receive antiviral therapy as soon as possible. The baby can also be affected by the varicella virus and may develop neonatal varicella syndrome if they are not vaccinated or do not have immunity. Therefore, it is important to give antiviral treatment to both mother and baby.\n\nIn this scenario, the pregnant lady acquires chickenpox 3 days prior to delivery, which means she has already developed the infection before giving birth. This leaves us with options B, C, and D as possible answers.\n\nThe study on laparoscopic cholecystectomy during pregnancy does not provide any information on varicella in pregnancy. The other studies are also irrelevant to this question. Therefore, we need to rely on general guidelines for varicella in pregnant women.\n\nBased on CDC guidelines, the mother should receive antiviral treatment before delivery and the baby may require antiviral treatment as well if they do not have immunity. This leaves us with options B and C as possible answers.\n\nThe question also mentions that the delivery is by normal vaginal route, which does not affect our answer. Therefore, we can eliminate option A as it is incorrect. Option D is also incorrect as giving antiviral treatment to baby alone may not be sufficient.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B: Give antiviral treatment to mother before delivery\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
