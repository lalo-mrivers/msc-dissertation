["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the best distribution to study daily admission of head injury patients in a trauma care centre. The provided documents are not directly related to statistics or data analysis. However, we can rule out options B and C as they do not relate to counting data over time. Option A, normal distribution, is also unlikely as it assumes continuous data whereas the number of admissions per day would be discrete. Therefore, the best option would be D, Poisson distribution, which is commonly used for modeling count data.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
