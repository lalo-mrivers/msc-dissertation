["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, none of them explicitly discuss the ossification of cartilage in the mandible. However, a search for relevant information in the context of human development and skeletal growth reveals that the mandible develops from Meckel's cartilage and its secondary cartilages. The condylar process and coronoid process are formed from these cartilages and eventually ossify. There is no mention of the upper half of the ramus above the level of the mandibular foramen as a part that ossifies in cartilage. Therefore, the correct answer is B: Condylar process.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
