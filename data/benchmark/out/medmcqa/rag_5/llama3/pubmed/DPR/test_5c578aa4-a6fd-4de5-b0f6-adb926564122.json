["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, there is no direct relevance to embalming or death certificates. However, since the question pertains to a specific section of a penal code (IPC), I will review each option carefully.\\nThe only relevant document that may provide some context is 'Organs for transplantation. The Singapore experience.' It discusses the Human Organ Transplant Act in Singapore and presumed consent for organ donation. This information does not seem directly related to embalming or death certificates, but it might be useful in understanding the penal code.\\nTherefore, I will focus on the options provided:\\nA: IPC 201 - This section deals with grievous hurt, which is unrelated to embalming or death certificates.\\nB: IPC 297 - This section pertains to acts done by persons violating a trust. Although it seems vaguely relevant to some extent, it does not specifically address embalming or issuing death certificates.\\nC: IPC 299 - This section deals with causing death by negligence, which is somewhat related to the concept of issuing a death certificate.\\nD: IPC 498 - This section pertains to cruelty by husband or relatives, which has no connection to embalming or death certificates.\\nGiven these considerations, I will choose option C as it seems the most relevant to the context.\", \"answer_choice\": C}"]
