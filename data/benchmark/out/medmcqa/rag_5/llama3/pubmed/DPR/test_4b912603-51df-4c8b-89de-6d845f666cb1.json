["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about true statements regarding a diabetic mother. The first option, hyperglycemia occurring in all infants of diabetic mothers, is not supported by the provided documents. There is no information on glycogen levels or blood glucose levels in rat ova during cleavage that would imply that all infants of diabetic mothers have hyperglycemia. Therefore, this option can be eliminated.\\nThe second option, high incidence of congenital heart anomalies being common, may not be supported by the provided documents as there is no specific information on congenital heart anomalies or cardiac issues in rat ova during cleavage. However, it is possible that some infants born to diabetic mothers may have an increased risk of congenital heart anomalies.\\nThe third option, small baby, could potentially be true based on the provided documents. The study on glycogen levels of rat ova during cleavage found that amounts of this polysaccharide in these eggs were relatively constant during cleavage. There is no specific information on the impact of diabetes on fetal growth or development.\\nThe fourth option, beta agonist drugs being contraindicated during delivery, could be true based on the provided documents. The study on the effect of beta adrenergic blockade upon exercise-induced changes in blood coagulation and fibrinolysis found that the activation of fibrinolysis by exercise is not mediated by the beta adrenergic receptor.\\nTherefore, options B and D are more likely to be true based on the provided documents.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
