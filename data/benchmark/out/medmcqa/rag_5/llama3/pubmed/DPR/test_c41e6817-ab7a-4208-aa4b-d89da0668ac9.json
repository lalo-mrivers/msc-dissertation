["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Step 1: Analyze the given values of pCO2, pO2, and pH. Since pCO2 is 30mm Hg, it's a low value indicating that there is less CO2 in the blood. This suggests respiratory alkalosis. Step 2: Consider the value of pO2 (105mm Hg), which is high, suggesting that there is an increase in oxygen levels. This reinforces the idea that the patient has respiratory alkalosis. Finally, looking at the pH value (7.46), which is slightly above normal, further supports the diagnosis of respiratory alkalosis.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
