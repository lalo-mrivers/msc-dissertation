["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about apoptosis, which is cell death. We are given four options to choose from. Option A states that there is no inflammation during apoptosis, but it's known that apoptosis can trigger an inflammatory response. Therefore, this option is false. Option B says the plasma membrane remains intact, which is true as apoptosis involves a controlled process of cellular disintegration without compromising cell membrane integrity. Option C mentions organelle swelling, but I couldn't find any specific information about it being exclusive to apoptosis or not. Finally, Option D states that apoptosis is affected by dedicated genes, which is also true as programmed cell death is regulated by specific gene expression.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
