The rash cleared after three days without desquamation and was accompanied by tender postauricular and suboccipital lymphadenopathy.\\nThe patient had previously experienced upper respiratory tract infection (URTI).

Rubella typically causes a rash that lasts several days and may be accompanied by sore throat, fever, and lymphadenopathy.\\nMeasles also causes a characteristic rash, but it is often accompanied by other symptoms such as fever, cough, and conjunctivitis.\\nErythema infectiosum, on the other hand, typically presents with a distinctive ' slapped cheek' rash, fever, and sore throat.\\nThe presence of URTI before the onset of the rash suggests that Erythema infectiosum is the most likely diagnosis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
