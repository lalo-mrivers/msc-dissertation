["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"This question is related to cardiology, specifically Eisenmenger syndrome. The relevant documents provided are not directly related to the topic, but we can use our general medical knowledge and think step-by-step about the characteristics of Eisenmenger syndrome.\n\nEisenmenger syndrome is a complication of unrepaired tetralogy of Fallot or other cardiac defects with an open shunt. It is characterized by pulmonary hypertension and right-to-left shunting of blood.\n\nWe are looking for True/False statements, so we need to think about the typical features of Eisenmenger syndrome.\n\nPulmonary veins are not distended: False (pulmonary veins are often dilated in Eisenmenger syndrome due to increased pressure).\n\nRV & LV walls come back to normal size: False (the right ventricle and left ventricle walls are typically thickened or hypertrophied in Eisenmenger syndrome due to chronic volume overload).\n\nDilatation of central pulmonary artery: True (pulmonary arteries dilate in response to increased pressure, leading to a prominent central pulmonary trunk).\n\nPeripheral pruning of pulmonary arteries: True (smaller pulmonary arteries undergo 'pruning' or constriction in response to increased pressure).\n\n\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C/D\""]
