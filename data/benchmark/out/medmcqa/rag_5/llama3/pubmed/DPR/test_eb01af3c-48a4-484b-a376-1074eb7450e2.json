["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"No relevant documents mention Hyperpolarizing Cyclic Nucleotide (HCN) gated channels. None of the provided documents discuss cardiac rhythm generation, mitochondrial action potential, myocardial muscle contraction, or memory formation in relation to HCN gated channels. Therefore, we must rely on external knowledge. HCN gated channels are a type of ion channel responsible for generating pacemaker activity and regulating the cardiac rhythm.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
