["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the management of a newborn baby whose mother has chronic hepatitis B infection. The baby's HBsAg status is positive but HBeAg is negative. This suggests that the baby is infected with HBV, but the maternal viral load is likely to be low as HBeAg is not detected.\n\nA review of the relevant documents shows no direct connection between glycogen levels in rat ova and hepatitis B infection.\n\nThe effect of beta adrenergic blockade on blood coagulation and fibrinolysis has no bearing on this question.\n\nComparative effect of calcium and the adrenergic system on calcitonin secretion has no relevance to hepatitis B infection or its management.\n\nAcute bacterial meningitis in childhood is a different topic altogether, unrelated to chronic hepatitis B infection.\n\nAntiphytoviral activity of 2,4 dioxo hexahydro triazine is not relevant to this question either.\n\nGiven the information provided, the most important factor is the mother's HBsAg positivity and HBeAg negativity. This suggests that the baby has been infected with HBV, but the maternal viral load is likely to be low. The most appropriate treatment for the baby would be both active and passive immunization soon after birth.\",\n\"answer_choice\": A"]
