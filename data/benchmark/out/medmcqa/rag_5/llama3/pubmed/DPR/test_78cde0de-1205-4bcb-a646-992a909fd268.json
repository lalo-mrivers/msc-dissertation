["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To calculate the neonatal mortality rate, we need to first calculate the number of live births. Given that the total number of live births is 12,450 and the number of stillbirths is 212, the number of live births is 12,450 - 212 = 12,238. Next, we need to calculate the number of neonatal deaths by subtracting the number of stillbirths from the total number of neonatal deaths: 450 (neonatal deaths) - 212 (stillbirths) = 238. Finally, we can calculate the neonatal mortality rate by dividing the number of neonatal deaths by the number of live births and multiplying by 1,000. This gives us: (238 / 12,238) x 1,000 = approximately 19.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
