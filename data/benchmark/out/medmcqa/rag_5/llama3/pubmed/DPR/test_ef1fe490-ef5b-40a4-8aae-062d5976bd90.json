["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"This question is a statistics problem, unrelated to the provided medical documents. The average GFR is given as 85 ml/min with a standard deviation of 25. To calculate the range for a 90% confidence interval, we can use the formula: lower limit = mean - (1.645 x SD), upper limit = mean + (1.645 x SD). Plugging in the values, we get: lower limit = 85 - (1.645 x 25) = 81, and upper limit = 85 + (1.645 x 25) = 89.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
