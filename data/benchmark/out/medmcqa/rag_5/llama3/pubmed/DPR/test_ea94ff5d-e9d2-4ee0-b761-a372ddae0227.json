["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the chief complaint when the interocclusal distance is increased beyond physiologic limits. Considering the documents provided, there is no direct mention of this specific topic. However, one document talks about geriatric oral health promotion and dental education. Another document discusses restructuring the delivery system in healthcare. There are also papers on population modeling and organ transplantation.

This could be related to an occlusal disharmony in centric, which is a common problem in dentistry. \", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
