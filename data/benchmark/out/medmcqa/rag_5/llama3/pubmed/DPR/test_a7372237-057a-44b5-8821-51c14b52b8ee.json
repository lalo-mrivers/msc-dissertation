["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant document for this question is 'Periodontal aspects of hereditary epidermolysis bullosa'. Within this document, it discusses oral manifestations and association with periodontal alterations. The topic of excessive bleeding during oral surgery is not explicitly mentioned. However, I can infer that the correct answer would be related to positioning during oral surgery to minimize bleeding. Among the options provided, I find a possible connection between position and bleeding control. Upon further analysis, I deduce that positioning can affect blood flow and pressure, which in turn can impact bleeding. Therefore, it is reasonable to consider the effect of different positions on bleeding.\", \"answer_choice\": A}"]
