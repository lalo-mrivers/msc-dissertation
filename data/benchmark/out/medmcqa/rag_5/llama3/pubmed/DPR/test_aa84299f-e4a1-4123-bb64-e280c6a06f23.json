["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Raised serum alkaline phosphatase is typically seen in conditions that affect bone metabolism. Paget's disease, multiple myeloma, osteomalacia, and hyperthyroidism are all potential causes of elevated alkaline phosphatase levels. The question asks about what condition would NOT cause raised serum alkaline phosphatase, so we need to identify the condition that is less likely to affect bone metabolism. Hyperthyroidism is a metabolic disorder that primarily affects thyroid function, rather than bone metabolism. Therefore, it is unlikely to be associated with elevated alkaline phosphatase levels.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
