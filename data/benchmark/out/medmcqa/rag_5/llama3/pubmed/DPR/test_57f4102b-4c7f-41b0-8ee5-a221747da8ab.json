["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about cell-mediated immune reactions in periodontitis. Periodontitis is an inflammatory condition that involves the immune system's response to bacterial plaque. The documents provided discuss various topics such as fixed-drug eruptions, campaigning for change, patienthood, presenting a talk at an academic meeting, and solitary late recurrence of renal cell carcinoma presenting as duodenal ulcer. None of these topics seem directly related to periodontitis or the immune system's response to it. However, one document that is indirectly relevant is 'Patienthood' which talks about the importance of interacting with patients in learning how to become a humane physician. This made me think about the role of the immune system in responding to infection and inflammation. Cell-mediated immune reactions involve T-cells which are responsible for delayed hypersensitivity. Therefore, it is likely that cell-mediated immune reactions occur in periodontitis because subjects with periodontitis have T-lymphocytes sensitized to bacterial plaque antigens.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
