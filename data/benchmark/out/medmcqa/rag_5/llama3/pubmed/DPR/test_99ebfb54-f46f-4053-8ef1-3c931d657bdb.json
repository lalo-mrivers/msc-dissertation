["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"While there are no specific documents that directly relate to biopsy specimens or the preservation of tissues for examination, we can consider the general principles and procedures used in healthcare settings. In this context, it is common practice to fix or preserve tissue samples immediately after removal through immersion in a suitable medium or solution. This helps prevent autolysis, which is the self-digestion of tissues due to enzymatic activity, and allows for better preservation and examination of the specimens.\n\nGiven the available options, we can focus on those that are commonly used as fixatives in histopathology laboratories. Formaldehyde is a widely used fixative in tissue processing, and it is often dissolved in water at concentrations between 1-10%. Hydrogen peroxide is not typically used as a fixative for biopsy specimens.\n\nConsidering the options, we can deduce that B: 10% formalin or D: 1% formalin are more likely to be correct answers. However, we need more specific information or context to make a definitive choice between these two options.\n\nFor now, let's assume that the most appropriate answer is one of the formaldehyde-based fixatives.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
