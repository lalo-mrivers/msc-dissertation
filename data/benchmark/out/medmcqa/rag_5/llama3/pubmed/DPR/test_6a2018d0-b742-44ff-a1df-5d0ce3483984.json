["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To calculate sensitivity and specificity of the test, we need to use the given data. First, we need to define true positives (TP) as the number of diseased individuals who tested positive. True negatives (TN) are the number of non-diseased individuals who tested negative. False positives (FP) are the number of non-diseased individuals who tested positive. And false negatives (FN) are the number of diseased individuals who tested negative.\n\nFrom the data, we have 273 diseased individuals who tested positive, so TP = 273. We also know that the total number of diseased individuals is 273 + FN (false negatives). Let's assume this number is x. Then, FN = x - 273.\n\nThe total number of non-diseased individuals is 595. The number of false positives is FP, and true negatives are TN. TN = 595 - FP.\n\nNow we can calculate sensitivity:\n\nSensitivity = TP / (TP + FN)\n= 273 / (273 + x-273)\n= 273 / x\n\nAnd now we can calculate specificity:\n\nSpecificity = TN / (TN + FP)\n= (595 - FP) / (595 + FP)\n\nWe need to find the value of FP that satisfies both sensitivity and specificity. By substituting the values, we get:\n\nSensitivity = 95%\nFP = 5\n\nNow we can calculate the final values:\n\nSpecificity = TN / (TN + FP)\n= 590 / 600\n= 98.33%\n\nSo, Sensitivity is 95% and Specificity is 98.33%. However, since only options B and D are close to these values, let's compare them with the given options.\n\nOption A has sensitivity 90%, which is lower than our calculated value of 95%.\n\nOption C has sensitivity 80%, which is even lower than 90%.\n\nOption D has sensitivity 75%, which is significantly lower than our calculated value.\n\nTherefore, option B (Sensitivity 95% Specificity 90%) is the closest match to our calculated values.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
