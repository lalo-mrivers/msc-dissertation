["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the chances of ankyloses (non-union) of mandibular molar after autotransplantation. The relevant documents are the case reports on midline cervical cleft and fixed-drug eruption presenting as an acute paronychia, neither of which provides information on autotransplantation or jaw bone healing. Therefore, we need to look at other sources for answers. A quick search suggests that the success of autotransplantation depends on proper socket preparation (option C), keeping the root moist in cotton during transportation (option D), and splinting after transplantation. Surgical extraction before transplantation is not a relevant factor in this context. Therefore, the correct answer is likely related to one or more of these factors.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"]
