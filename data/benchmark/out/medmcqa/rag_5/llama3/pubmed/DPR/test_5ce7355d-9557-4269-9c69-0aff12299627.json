["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about why deciduous teeth do not show fluorosis. We need to look for information that compares deciduous teeth with permanent teeth or discusses the characteristics of fluorosis. None of the provided documents explicitly discuss fluorosis, but we can try to find relevant information. The 'Time for action on black health' document seems unrelated. The other documents don't mention fluorosis either. The 'Deciduous teeth do not show fluorosis because...' question suggests that deciduous teeth are somehow resistant or exempt from fluorosis. A possible connection could be made with the 'International workshop on non-mitochondrial cytochromes c' document, but there is no obvious link.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
