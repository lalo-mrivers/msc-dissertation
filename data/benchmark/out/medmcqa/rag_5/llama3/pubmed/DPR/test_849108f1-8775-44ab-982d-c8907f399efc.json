["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about a 16-year-old girl with primary amenorrhea. The patient has well-developed breasts (Tanner's stage 5) but minimal pubic hair (Tanner's stage 1). This suggests that the patient has normal breast development but lacks pubic and axillary hair, which are typical features of women with normal puberty. Given the lack of response to OCPs prescribed two years prior, it is unlikely that the issue is related to hormonal imbalance. The patient's normal stature and being a football player also suggest that she is not suffering from any systemic disorder.\n\nBased on these findings, the most probable diagnosis is that the patient has Turner syndrome, which is characterized by short stature and lack of pubic and axillary hair in girls with normal breast development.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
