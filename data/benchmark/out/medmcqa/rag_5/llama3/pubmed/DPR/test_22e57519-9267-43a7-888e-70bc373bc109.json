["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presented with severe hydrophobia, which is a classic symptom of rabies. Corneal scrapings were obtained from the patient, suggesting that we are dealing with a case where the virus may be present in the nervous system. Negri bodies are characteristic histopathological findings in the brain tissue of patients with rabies, but they would not be detected by corneal scrapings. Antibodies to rabies virus could be present in the serum, but the test should aim at detecting the virus itself. PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) for rabies virus and indirect immunofluorescence are both tests that can detect the virus directly.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
