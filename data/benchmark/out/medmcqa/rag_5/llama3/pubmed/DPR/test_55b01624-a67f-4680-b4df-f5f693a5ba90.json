["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Since there is no direct connection between the provided documents and springs, I will analyze each document separately. None of the documents discuss spring physics or elasticity. The medical-related documents describe various conditions, nursing perspectives, and statistical analysis methods. There is no mention of physical phenomena like springs. Therefore, I must consider external knowledge to answer this question. According to Hooke's Law, when the length of a spring is doubled, its force increases quadratically. This means that the effect is not doubled, but rather four times.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
