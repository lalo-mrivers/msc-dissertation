A quick review of fundamental physiology reveals that the renal threshold for glucose is approximately 180 mg/dL (7.8 mmol/L). If the blood glucose level exceeds this threshold, it may be excreted into the urine. Hence, the presence of glucose in urine indicates that the renal threshold for glucose is exceeded.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
