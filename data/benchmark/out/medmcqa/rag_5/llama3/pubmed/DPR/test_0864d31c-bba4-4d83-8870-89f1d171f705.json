["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about imaging in primary survey of a trauma patient. The relevant documents are unrelated to trauma patients or imaging. Therefore, we need to consider general medical knowledge and principles related to trauma care.\n\nA primary survey is the initial assessment of a trauma patient, which includes evaluating the airway, breathing, circulation, disability (neurostatus), and exposure (undressing). Imaging in this setting typically aims to identify life-threatening injuries that require immediate attention.\n\nAccordingly, the question's options can be evaluated based on their relevance to primary survey imaging. Cervical X-ray is a crucial imaging modality in trauma patients, as it helps detect cervical spine fractures or instability. Chest X-ray and pelvic X-ray are also commonly used in trauma care, especially for patients with suspected thoracic or abdominal injuries.\n\nHemodynamically unstable patients may require immediate surgical intervention, and CT scan can be useful in identifying life-threatening injuries that require prompt attention.\n\nIn contrast, the option suggesting that all patients should have a chest X-ray-PA view only seems too restrictive. Trauma patients often require multiple imaging modalities to thoroughly evaluate their injuries.\n\nConsidering these principles, it becomes clear that option D is the exception.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
