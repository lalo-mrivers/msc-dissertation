["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about a 16-year-old male with nasal obstruction and recurrent epistaxis. The CT scan shows an enhancing mass in the nasopharynx with minimal extension into the sphenoid sinus and no lateral extension. There are no other relevant documents that provide information about this specific condition. Since there is no mention of cancer, tumors, or any other medical conditions that would affect the nasal cavity, it seems that we need to look for a condition that is related to the nasopharynx. The documents provided do not contain any information about the nasopharynx, but they do discuss some medical topics. However, none of these topics are relevant to this specific question.\n\nThe only option that could potentially be correct is IA or IB because both stages refer to a tumor that starts in the nasopharynx and does not involve other parts of the head or neck.\n\nTherefore, it seems that the most likely answer would be one of these two options.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
