["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about pure left-sided failure. Left-sided heart failure refers to failure of the left ventricle or mitral valve. ASD (Atrial Septal Defect) can cause left-sided heart failure, but it's not a direct cause of pure left-sided failure because ASD typically affects both sides equally. Aortic stenosis and patent ductus arteriosus are both right-sided conditions that wouldn't directly cause left-sided failure. Pulmonary valvular obstruction is also a right-sided condition that would not cause left-sided heart failure.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
