["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the effect of one unit of packed red blood cells (PRBC) on hematocrit (HCT). Hematocrit is a measure of the proportion of red blood cells in the blood. Increasing the number of red blood cells would therefore increase HCT. However, the amount of increase depends on various factors such as the patient's initial hemoglobin level and the volume of PRBC transfused. Unfortunately, none of the provided documents provide information on this topic. Therefore, I must rely on general medical knowledge to answer this question.\", \"answer_choice\": C}"]
