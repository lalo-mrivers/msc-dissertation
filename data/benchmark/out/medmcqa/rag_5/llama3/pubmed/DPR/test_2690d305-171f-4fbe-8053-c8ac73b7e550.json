However, we can look for indirect clues or information that might help us answer the question.\n\nAfter reviewing the documents, we notice that there are some references to beta adrenergic receptors and blockers. This makes me think about the document titled 'The effects of adrenergic agonists and blockers on antigen-induced DNA synthesis in vitro.' In this document, it is mentioned that beta blockers can enhance antigen-induced responses.\n\nThis got me thinking about steroids and their relationship with immunocompromise.
