["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the management of a 32-year-old woman with primary infertility due to bilateral tubal block seen at cornu on hysterosalpingogram. The patient has a 5-year history, which suggests that all other possible causes have been ruled out and the diagnosis of bilateral tubal block is confirmed. The options provided are related to fertility treatment and management. Based on this information, we can eliminate options A (in vitro fertilization) and C (intracytoplasmic sperm injection) as they are not directly related to the correction of tubal blockage. Option D (tuboplasty) is a surgical procedure that aims to repair or restore tubal patency, which makes it the most relevant option for this patient's condition. Therefore, the next step would be to consider laparoscopy and hysteroscopy as an invasive procedure to confirm the diagnosis and potentially perform tuboplasty.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
