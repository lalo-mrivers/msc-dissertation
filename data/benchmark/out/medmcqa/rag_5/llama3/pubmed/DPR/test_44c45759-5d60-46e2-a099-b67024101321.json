["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking what factor affects the darkening of radiograph X-ray. From the provided documents, we can see that there's no mention of thickness of object, quality and quantity of X-rays, or velocity of electron emitted from cathode affecting the darkening of radiograph X-ray. However, it mentions blocking beta adrenergic receptors reducing exercise hyperventilation (40 to 60% VO2 max). This information is not relevant to the question about factors that affect the darkening of radiograph X-ray.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
