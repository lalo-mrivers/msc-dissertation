Cross-sectional studies typically involve observing a group of people at one point in time or collecting data on a group of people over a specific period. Considering the documents provided, none of them mention Neisseria gonorrhoeae, spotted fever rickettsiae, Rickettsia prowazeki, calcium, phosphate, magnesium, and hydrogen ion metabolism, or proteoglycans.
