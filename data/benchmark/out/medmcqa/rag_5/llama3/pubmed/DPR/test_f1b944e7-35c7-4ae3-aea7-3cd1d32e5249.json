["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the type of collagen present in healing and granulation tissue. The provided documents are case reports and reviews on various medical conditions, but none of them specifically discuss collagen types or tissue healing. Therefore, we must rely on general knowledge and principles to answer this question. Granulation tissue is a type of connective tissue that forms during the healing process after injury or trauma. It is characterized by the presence of young fibroblasts, new blood vessels, and a loose network of collagen fibers. Type III collagen is the most common type of collagen found in granulation tissue and is involved in the formation of new blood vessels and connective tissue. Therefore, it is likely that Type III collagen is present in healing and granulation tissue.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"]
