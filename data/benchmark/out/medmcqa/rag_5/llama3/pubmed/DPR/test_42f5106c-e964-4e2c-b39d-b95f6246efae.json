["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about a primarily RNA-based technique. None of the options mention RNA specifically. Next generation sequencing can be used for DNA or RNA analysis, but it's not exclusively RNA-based. PCR is typically used to amplify DNA sequences. Sanger's technique is also a DNA-sequencing method. Western blotting is a protein-detection method and doesn't involve RNA at all. Therefore, the answer must be something that deals primarily with RNA.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"None of the above (not among the options)\""]
