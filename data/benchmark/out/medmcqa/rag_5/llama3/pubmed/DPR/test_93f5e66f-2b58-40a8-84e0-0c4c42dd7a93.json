["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"After reviewing the provided documents, I did not find any information related to Golgi tendon organs. Since the question is about detecting something using Golgi tendon organs, I will analyze each document again. I found that none of the documents mention Golgi tendon organs or their function in detection. Therefore, I will rely on my general medical knowledge and search for information on this topic. Golgi tendon organs are specialized sensory receptors that detect muscle tension. They respond to changes in muscle length and force, providing feedback about muscle activity. Based on this information, the answer should be related to detecting muscle tension or activity.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: All\"\n}"]
