["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"In the given documents, we can see that PPACK-thrombin is a noncompetitive inhibitor of alpha-thrombin binding to human platelets. This means that PPACK-thrombin does not bind to the same site as alpha-thrombin on the platelet surface, but it prevents alpha-thrombin from binding. Therefore, the Km value of alpha-thrombin remains normal, while its vmax decreases.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
