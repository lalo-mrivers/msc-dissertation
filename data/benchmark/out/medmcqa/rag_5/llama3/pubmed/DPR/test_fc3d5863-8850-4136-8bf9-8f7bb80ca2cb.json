["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"There are no relevant documents that directly discuss the differences between rifabutin and rifampicin. However, we can look for information on the half-life of these drugs. According to the literature on Defining adult respiratory distress syndrome, there is no mention of rifabutin or rifampicin. In [Renal cell carcinoma and Reiter's syndrome], there is no discussion of these medications either. Endometrial tuberculosis acquired by a health care worker in a clinical laboratory does not provide information on rifabutin or rifampicin. Fixed-drug eruption presenting as an acute paronychia only mentions cefalexine, but there is no comparison with rifabutin or rifampicin.
