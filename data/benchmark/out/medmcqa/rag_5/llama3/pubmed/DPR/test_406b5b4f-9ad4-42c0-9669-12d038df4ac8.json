["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"After reviewing the provided documents, I did not find any information related to oxygen delivery or respiratory care. Therefore, I will rely on my general knowledge of medical concepts to answer this question. The highest concentration of oxygen is typically delivered through a non-rebreather mask (NRB) or a tight-fitting mask with a reservoir bag. However, since the options provided are not NRB or tight-fitting mask with a reservoir bag, I will eliminate those choices.
