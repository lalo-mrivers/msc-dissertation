["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the change in blood flow if the radius of blood vessels is increased by 50%. To solve this problem, we need to use the formula for blood flow: F = Ï€r^4P. Since the radius increases by 50%, it will double (2 times). So, r^4 becomes (2r)^4 or 16r^4. This means that the blood flow will increase by a factor of 16.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
