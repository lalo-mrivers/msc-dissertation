["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the usefulness of a certain drug for MRSA (Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus). The provided documents don't contain any direct information about this topic. However, we can look for any relevant information about antibiotics or bacterial infections. In 'Fixed-drug eruption presenting as an acute paronychia', cefalexine is mentioned as the causative agent of a fixed-drug eruption. This doesn't specifically mention MRSA but does show that cefalexine can cause adverse reactions. Therefore, we can infer that cefaclor, which is another cephalosporin antibiotic like cefalexine, might not be effective against MRSA due to its potential for adverse reactions. On the other hand, vancomycin is often used as a last-line antibiotic against MRSA.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
