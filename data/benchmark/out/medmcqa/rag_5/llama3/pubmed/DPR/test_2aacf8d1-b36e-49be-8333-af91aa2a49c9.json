["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about cells affected in glaucomatous optic neuropathy. There are no relevant documents provided that directly answer this question. However, we can analyze the given documents to see if there are any clues or information that might help us make an educated guess. The first document discusses the immunogenic activity of measles virus and has nothing to do with the optic nerve or glaucoma. The second document is about clinical disorders of calcium, phosphate, magnesium, and hydrogen ion metabolism, which also doesn't seem relevant. The third document talks about penicillin penetration into human phagocytes containing gonococci, but this doesn't provide any information about cells affected in glaucomatous optic neuropathy. Finally, the fourth document discusses plasma expanders' effect on blood group serological study results and is also not related to our question. Given that there are no direct answers or relevant information in these documents, we must rely on general medical knowledge. Glaucomatous optic neuropathy is a condition affecting the optic nerve, specifically the retinal ganglion cells. Therefore, it's likely that the affected cells are ganglion cells.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"]
