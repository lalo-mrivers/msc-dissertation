["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question describes a 4-year-old child with grey teeth showing extensive wear. The radiographic examination reveals deposits of secondary dentin in these teeth. Based on this information, it's unlikely that the condition is related to tooth development or formation, as all primary teeth are present. This points towards a problem with the structure and durability of the enamel. Neonatal hypoplasia is ruled out since the child has a normal complement of primary teeth. Cleidocranial dysplasia is also an unlikely cause since it's a condition primarily affecting bone development, not tooth wear. Amelogenesis imperfecta or Dentinogenesis imperfecta are more plausible causes due to their involvement in enamel and dentin formation respectively. Considering the extensive wear on occlusal and incisal surfaces, Dentinogenesis imperfecta is the most likely cause.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
