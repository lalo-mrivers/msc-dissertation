["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about hormones given after resection of posterior pituitary. From the provided documents, there is no mention of pituitary gland or its hormones. However, we can look at general medical knowledge to answer this question. After resection of posterior pituitary, patients may require hormone replacement therapy. Glucagon, Thyroxine, and Mineralocoicoid are all hormones that have nothing to do with the posterior pituitary. Estradiol is a type of estrogen hormone which could be relevant in certain cases. However, we can rule out it being given as replacement after resection of posterior pituitary because the pituitary gland primarily regulates anterior pituitary hormones such as ACTH, TSH, LH, FSH and GH, but not estradiol or progesterone (which are gonadal hormones).\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
