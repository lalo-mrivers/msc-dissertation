["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Since there is no relevant information provided about GIC (Glass Ionomer Cement) or its tensile strength, we cannot determine the answer directly. However, upon reviewing the given documents, we can see that they primarily focus on topics such as glycogen levels in rat ova, leucocyte migration inhibition tests for measles virus, antibiotic resistance of Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and cirrhosis in South London. None of these topics seem to be related to GIC or its tensile strength. Therefore, we can conclude that the information required to answer this question is not present in any of the given documents.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
