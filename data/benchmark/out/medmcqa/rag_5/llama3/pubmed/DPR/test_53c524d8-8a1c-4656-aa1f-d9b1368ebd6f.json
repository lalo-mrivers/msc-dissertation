["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is comparing the rates of extubation failure between two methods. The numbers given are 90 out of 160 for conventional CPAP and 40 out of 160 for bubble CPAP. This suggests that we have binomial data, where each participant has a success or failure outcome. Therefore, we need to use a test that is suitable for comparing the proportions of successes (or failures) between two groups. The Chi-squared test is a common choice for this type of comparison.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
