["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has a history of tachyarrhythmias and is on an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD). He develops shock. The question asks for the best method to know the position and integrity of ICD. We need to identify the most suitable imaging modality to assess the ICD position and function. There are no relevant documents discussing tachyarrhythmias, patienthood, or chemometrics in pharmaceutical analysis. The midline cervical cleft document is irrelevant as well. The teaching new acne patients with a customized slide sound program does not provide any information about ICDs or imaging modalities. International workshop on non-mitochondrial cytochromes c also does not contain relevant information. Therefore, we need to rely on general medical knowledge and look for options related to imaging modalities.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
