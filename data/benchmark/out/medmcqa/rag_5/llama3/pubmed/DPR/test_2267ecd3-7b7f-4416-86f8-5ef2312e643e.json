["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The child presents with high grade fever, inspiratory stridor and swallowing difficulty with drooling of saliva. This suggests a possible case of epiglottitis. Epiglottitis is typically caused by Haemophilus influenzae type B (Hib) infection. The patient's symptoms are consistent with this diagnosis. Therefore, the recommended treatment is focused on treating the underlying infection.\n\nThe first step would be to administer IV ceftriaxone to target the suspected bacterial cause of epiglottitis.\n\nNext, nebulized racemic epinephrine is not indicated as it is typically used for acute asthma exacerbations.\n\nAnti-diphtheria toxin is not relevant in this case as diphtheria does not typically present with inspiratory stridor and swallowing difficulty.\n\nCoicosteroids may be used to reduce swelling and inflammation but are not the primary treatment for epiglottitis.\n\nTherefore, the recommended treatment is IV ceftriaxone (option D).\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
