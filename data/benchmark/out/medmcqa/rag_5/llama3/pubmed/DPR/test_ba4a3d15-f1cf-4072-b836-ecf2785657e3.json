["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks which substance does not cross the placenta. We need to review the given documents for information about substances that cross or do not cross the placenta. The document 'Neuroleptic malignant syndrome' does not provide relevant information. The other three documents are related to different medical topics, such as HIV latency, Fc epsilon receptors, and magnetic field estimation. None of these documents mention placental transfer of substances. Therefore, we need to rely on our general knowledge of pharmacology. Heparin is an anticoagulant that can cross the placenta. Morphine and naloxone are opioids that can also cross the placenta. Warfarin is a vitamin K antagonist that does not cross the placenta. Based on this information, we can conclude that the correct answer is\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: Warfarin\""]
