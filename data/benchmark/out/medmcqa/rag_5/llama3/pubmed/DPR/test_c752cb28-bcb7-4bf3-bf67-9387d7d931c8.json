["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Duane's syndrome is a rare oculomotor disorder characterized by limited or absent abduction of one eye. It can also cause trismus (spasm of the muscles of mastication) and bilateral crepitus (crepitus means grating or crunching sound). The patient has sustained a subcondylar fracture on the left side, which is not related to Duane's syndrome. However, considering the symptoms mentioned in the case report of both Duane's syndrome and Rieger's anomaly, trismus and bilateral crepitus are possible symptoms. Therefore, the most likely answer is B: Trismus and bilateral crepitus.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
