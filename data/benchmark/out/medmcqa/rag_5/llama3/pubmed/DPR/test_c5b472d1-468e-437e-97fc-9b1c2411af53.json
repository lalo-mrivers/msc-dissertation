["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking to define a specific ratio. The provided documents are unrelated to mortality rates or life expectancy. Therefore, we need to look for relevant information that can help us with the definition. Upon reviewing the documents, I found 'organs for transplantation' which doesn't provide any relevant information. Then, I looked at 'Periodic solutions of population models...' and it's about mathematical modeling, not mortality rates or ratios. Next, I reviewed 'Upper arm radial nerve palsy after muscular effort:' and it's a medical article discussing occupational injuries.
