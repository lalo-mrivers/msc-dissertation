["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about anaerobic glycolysis. Anaerobic glycolysis is a process that occurs without the presence of oxygen. It is a metabolic pathway that breaks down glucose to produce energy. In this process, one molecule of glucose produces 2 ATPs and 2 NADH molecules. Since the question asks for which option produces 3 ATPs per unit glucose consumed, we can rule out options A, D, B, and C as they are not directly related to anaerobic glycolysis. Therefore, there is no correct answer among the given choices.\", \"answer_choice\": null}"]
