["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The given ECG has a 'mean' axis of 90deg, which means it is a left arm lead (I). In a standard ECG setup, the left arm lead I measures the electrical activity from the left arm to the right leg. Since the R wave voltage would be maximum in the direction perpendicular to the mean axis, the maximum voltage of the R wave would be expected in either lead III or lead II.\", \"answer_choice\": B}"]
