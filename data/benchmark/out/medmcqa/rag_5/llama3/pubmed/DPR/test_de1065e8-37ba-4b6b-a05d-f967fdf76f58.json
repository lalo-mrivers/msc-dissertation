["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"After reviewing the provided documents, I did not find any information about MHC Class II proteins or their expression. Therefore, I will rely on general knowledge to answer this question. MHC (Major Histocompatibility Complex) molecules are part of the immune system and play a crucial role in presenting antigens to T-cells. MHC Class II proteins are responsible for presenting antigens from extracellular sources, such as bacteria or viruses, to CD4+ T-cells. Based on this knowledge, I will identify the cells that express MHC Class II proteins.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
