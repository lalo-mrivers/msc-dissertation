["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the properties of amalgam, which is a type of dental filling material. The options are flow, ductility, brittleness, and malleability. Since the property that makes it undesirable to bevel occlusal margins of an amalgam cavity preparation is not related to its shape or ability to change shape, we can rule out options B, D. This leaves us with flow and brittleness. The text does not mention anything about flow, but it does mention osteochondromas, which are a type of bone tumor. The connection between this and amalgam properties is unclear, so we should focus on the other option. Brittleness is often used to describe materials that break or shatter easily, which makes sense in the context of not wanting to bevel occlusal margins.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
