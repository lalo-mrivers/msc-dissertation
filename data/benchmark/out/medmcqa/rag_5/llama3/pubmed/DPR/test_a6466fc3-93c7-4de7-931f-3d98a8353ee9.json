["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Ewing's sarcoma is a type of bone cancer that is characterized by the presence of small round blue tumor cells. To detect translocation t(11;22) in this malignancy, we need to look for genetic abnormalities. Conventional karyotyping would not be sensitive enough to detect this specific translocation. Next generation sequencing could potentially identify the translocation, but it may not be a practical option given that it is an expensive and time-consuming method. FISH (fluorescence in situ hybridization) is a common technique used to detect specific chromosomal abnormalities such as translocations, and it has been widely used in the diagnosis of Ewing's sarcoma. PCR (polymerase chain reaction) can also be used to amplify specific DNA sequences, but it may not be as reliable as FISH in detecting this type of translocation.\", \"answer_choice\": C}"]
