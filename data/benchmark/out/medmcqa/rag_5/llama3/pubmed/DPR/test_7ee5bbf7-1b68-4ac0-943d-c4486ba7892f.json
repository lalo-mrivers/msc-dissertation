["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about false positive results on EPT (Electrical Pulp Test) testing. The options provided are related to dental pulp conditions or patient factors that could affect the test. Since none of the documents provided are directly related to dental pulp tests, we need to look for any relevant information in the documents. Upon reviewing the documents, I found that none of them mention EPT testing or dental pulp conditions. Therefore, I will rely on general medical knowledge and consider the options. A false positive result could be due to various factors such as anxiety, improper isolation, or partial pulpal necrosis. An immature apex is not a condition that would cause a false positive result.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
