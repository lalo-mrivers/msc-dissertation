["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"This question is about the effect of combining two screening tests. When we combine two tests (in series), the sensitivity is increased if both tests are sensitive to the condition being detected. However, specificity is decreased because a positive result for either test can lead to false positives. In this case, since no relevant information about proteoglycans or Neisseria gonorrhoeae is provided in the question, we cannot make any connection between the given documents and the question.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A: Increased sensitivity and decreased specificity\"\n}"]
