["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The phallic stage of Freud's psychoanalytic theory refers to the stage where children become aware of their genitals and start to develop an interest in sexual matters. Piaget's stages of cognitive development are not directly related to Freud's psychoanalytic theory, so we need to look for correlations between the two theories.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to Piaget's theory, the sensorimotor stage corresponds to the first two years of life where infants learn through sensory experiences and motor activities. The phallic stage in Freud's theory occurs during the oedipal period, which is typically around 3-6 years old.
