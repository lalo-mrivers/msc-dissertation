["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking which phase of clinical trials does NOT follow good clinical practice. The relevant documents provided are not related to clinical trials or good clinical practice guidelines. Therefore, we need to rely on general knowledge and widely accepted principles. Good clinical practice is an internationally accepted standard that applies to all phases of clinical trials. It ensures the rights, safety, and well-being of trial subjects. Therefore, it is unlikely that any phase would not follow good clinical practice. However, the question is asking for a specific exception. Upon further consideration, we can think of one scenario where good clinical practice might not be applicable: preclinical studies, which involve in vitro or animal experiments to test the safety and efficacy of a drug. Preclinical studies do not involve human subjects, so good clinical practice guidelines may not apply directly. However, it is still important to ensure that these studies are conducted ethically and with proper animal welfare considerations.\n\nAnswer choice: A\"}"]
