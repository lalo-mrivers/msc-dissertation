["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about venous drainage of the esophagus. The documents provided do not contain information directly related to this topic. However, I can think step-by-step and make an educated guess based on general anatomical knowledge. The thoracic esophagus drains into the azygos vein (not A). There is no information about submucosal plexus in the documents (so B is incorrect). The cervical esophagus does not drain directly into the right brachiocephalic vein, it drains into the inferior thyroid vein and then into the internal jugular vein (not C). Lower esophageal veins do anastomose with the left gastric vein (D) is true. Therefore, I will choose D as my answer.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
