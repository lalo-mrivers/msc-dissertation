["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Firstly, let's start by considering the properties of myelinated nerve fibres. According to our relevant documents, there is no mention of subcapsular hematomas or health visitors' roles in campaigning or community health services. Therefore, we can rule out any information from these sources. The question appears to be related to neuroscience, so let's focus on the characteristics of myelinated nerve fibres. We have two options left: A and D. Option A suggests that conduction is slower in myelinated than non-myelinated fibres, which seems plausible. Option D states that depolarisation occurs only at nodes of Ranvier, which is also a known property of myelinated nerve fibres. Therefore, our focus narrows down to these two options.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
