["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Since the question is about Myocardial infarction, I will focus on relevant documents that discuss lung function measurements. The provided document 'Respiratory measurements' discusses interpreting simple measurements of lung function, but it does not mention myocardial infarction or any related topics. Therefore, I cannot find any information in this document that would help me answer the question. Next, I will consider the other documents. The 'Applications of behavior to poultry management' and 'A case report of both Duane's syndrome and Rieger's anomaly in a single patient' do not seem relevant to myocardial infarction either. Finally, I will look at 'Restructuring the system will benefit all', which discusses health care reform and restructuring the delivery system, but it does not provide information on myocardial infarction. Therefore, based on my step-by-step thinking, I cannot find any information in these documents that would help me answer the question.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
