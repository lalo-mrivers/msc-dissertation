["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Since the patient is a 2-year-old premature neonate who has developed GTCS (Grand Mal Seizure), we need to focus on investigations that can help diagnose the underlying pathology. Given the age and prematurity of the child, we should consider imaging modalities that are safe for young children. CT scan is often used in such cases as it provides good detail about brain structures. MRI is also a possibility but may not be necessary if CT scan provides sufficient information. Transcranial ultrasound is not relevant to this case as it's usually used to examine the brain parenchyma in real-time during neurosurgical procedures. X-ray is also not relevant as it doesn't provide any useful information about the brain pathology.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
