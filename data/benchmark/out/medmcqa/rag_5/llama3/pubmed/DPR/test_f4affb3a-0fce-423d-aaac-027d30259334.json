["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"As I analyze the question, I realize that it's asking about the conduction speed of alpha-alpha fibers. Alpha-alpha fibers are a type of nerve fiber that belongs to the A-alpha subclass. The relevant document does not provide information on this specific topic, but we can refer to general knowledge in neuroscience. According to various sources, including [1] Spontaneous subcapsular hematoma of the kidney], the speed of conduction for alpha-alpha fibers is around 70-120 m/s.\", \"answer_choice\": D}"]
