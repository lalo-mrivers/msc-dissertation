["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the cells most commonly affected in glaucomatous optic atrophy. None of the provided documents relate directly to this topic. However, one of the documents does mention 'optic' which is related to the eyes and visual pathway. The other documents do not provide any relevant information. Therefore, I will focus on the document that mentions 'optical'.

Therefore, I need to rely on general knowledge and medical textbooks to answer this question.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
