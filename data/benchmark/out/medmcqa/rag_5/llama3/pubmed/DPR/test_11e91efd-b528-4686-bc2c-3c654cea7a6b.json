["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"After reviewing the provided documents, I did not find any information about microdontia or its common locations in the teeth. The documents appear to be focused on various medical conditions such as osteochondromas, midline cervical clefts, and hereditary epidermolysis bullosa, with no mention of dental issues like microdontia. As a result, I must rely on general knowledge about oral anatomy and pathology. Microdontia is a condition characterized by the abnormally small size of one or more teeth.

According to various sources, including dental textbooks and online resources, the maxillary lateral incisor is often reported as the most commonly affected tooth in cases of microdontia.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
