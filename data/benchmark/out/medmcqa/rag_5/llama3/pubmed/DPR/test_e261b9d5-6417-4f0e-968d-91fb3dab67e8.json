["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the response of alveolar bone to traumatic occlusal forces. The relevant documents are medical texts discussing various topics such as subcapsular hematoma, spinal pain management, health visitor roles, and gliomas. None of these texts appear to be directly related to the topic of alveolar bone response. Therefore, we must look for information that is indirectly related or use general knowledge in this field. Alveolar bone remodeling is a well-known process in oral surgery. In response to traumatic forces, alveolar bone will initially undergo resorption and then reform. The main cell types involved are osteoclasts (resorption) and osteoblasts (rebuilding). This process is not specific to tension or pressure areas, but rather occurs throughout the affected area.\", \"answer_choice\": B}"]
