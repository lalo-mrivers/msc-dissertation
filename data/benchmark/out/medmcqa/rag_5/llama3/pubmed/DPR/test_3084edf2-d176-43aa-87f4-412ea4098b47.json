["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"This question is about alpha-thalassemia trait. Alpha-thalassemia is a genetic disorder that affects the production of hemoglobin. Electrophoresis shows the presence and quantity of different types of hemoglobin. In alpha-thalassemia trait, there are two possible genotypes: alpha/- or alphaalpha/-, both of which will have a normal HbF (fetal hemoglobin) level because it is only affected in severe forms of alpha-thalassemia. The HbA2 (adult hemoglobin) level should also be normal as alpha-thalassemia does not affect HbA2 production.\", \"answer_choice\": B}"]
