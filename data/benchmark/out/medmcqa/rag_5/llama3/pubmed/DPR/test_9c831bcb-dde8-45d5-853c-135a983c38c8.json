["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the relation between the variance of diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and vitamin D. To answer this, we need to compare the variances of DBP and vitamin D. The given data is: mean DBP = 110 mm Hg with SD = 11 mm Hg, and mean vitamin D = 18 ng/ml with SD = 3 ng/ml. We can calculate the variance of DBP as (SD)^2 = (11)^2 = 121 mm^2, and the variance of vitamin D as (SD)^2 = (3)^2 = 9 ng^2. Comparing these variances, we see that the variance of DBP is much larger than the variance of vitamin D.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B: Variance of DBP > 4 times Vitamin D\""]
