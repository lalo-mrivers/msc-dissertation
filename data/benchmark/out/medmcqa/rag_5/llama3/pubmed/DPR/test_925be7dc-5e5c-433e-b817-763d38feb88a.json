["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about Antigen-presenting cells. The given documents are related to protein-protein interactions, proteoglycans, and collagen binding. There is no direct connection between these topics and antigen-presenting cells. However, we can look for any information that might help us answer the question. For example, there is a mention of Langerhans cells in the context of glycosaminoglycan biosynthesis, but this is not directly related to antigen presentation. Therefore, we need to rely on general knowledge about immune system cells and their functions. Antigen-presenting cells are typically characterized by their ability to take up antigens, process them, and present them to T-cells. This function is important for the activation of immune responses. Based on this information, we can deduce that thymocytes (immature T-cells) are not antigen-presenting cells, as they do not have the capability to process and present antigens. Instead, they are involved in the maturation process of T-cells.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
