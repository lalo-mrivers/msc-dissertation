["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking which vitamin is synthesized in vivo by the human body. We need to analyze the given documents for any information related to vitamin synthesis. None of the provided documents mention anything about vitamins or their synthesis. Therefore, we cannot find a direct answer to this question. However, since the options are all names of specific vitamins, we can try to eliminate them one by one based on our general knowledge. Niacin and pantothenic acid are both synthesized in the human body, so A and B could be possible answers. Cyanocobalamin is vitamin B12, which is not synthesized in vivo, as it's an essential nutrient that must be obtained through dietary sources or supplements. Folic acid is also not synthesized in vivo, but rather absorbed from food and converted to its active form in the body. Therefore, based on our analysis, we can eliminate C and D as possible answers.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
