["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Since the question is about hepcidin's effect on iron absorption, we need to look for information related to hepcidin and iron. In the given documents, there is no mention of hepcidin or its effects on iron absorption. Therefore, we cannot find any direct evidence that supports one option over another. However, if we were to consider the molecular mechanisms involved in iron absorption, we could reason that an inhibitor of divalent metal ion transporter (Option C) would likely decrease iron absorption.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
