["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about long-term complications of infants born to I.D.D.M (Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus) mother AJE. Since the options are related to diabetes or its complications, I will focus on the relevant documents. None of the provided articles directly address diabetes or its complications in infants. However, the article 'Working with diverse families: building culturally competent systems of health care delivery' mentions nothing about diabetes or its long-term complications.\n\nThe other articles do not provide any information related to this question either. Therefore, I will consider the option that is most likely to be a complication of diabetes. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy and restructuring the system are not relevant to this question.\n\nAfter considering all available information, I conclude that the most likely long-term complication is DM (Diabetes Mellitus), which is an inherited condition that can develop in infants born to parents with diabetes.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
