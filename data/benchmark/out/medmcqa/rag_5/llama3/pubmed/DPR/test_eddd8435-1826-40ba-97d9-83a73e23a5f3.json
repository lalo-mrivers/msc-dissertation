["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the drug that does not belong to the amide group. We can look at the relevant documents for information on local anesthetics. From the document Human relaxin., we can see that procaine is mentioned as a type of local anesthetic. However, it doesn't explicitly state whether procaine belongs to the amide group or not. We can move on to another approach. In the document The negligible systemic availability of retinoids with multiple and excessive topical application of isotretinoin 0.05% gel (Isotrex) in patients with acne vulgaris., we see that isotretinoin is an example of a retinoid, but it's not mentioned as being part of the amide group. This gives us a hint to look for information on local anesthetics other than procaine. In the document Fusobacterium nucleatum subsp. fusiforme subsp. nov. and Fusobacterium nucleatum subsp. animalis subsp. nov., there is no relevant information about local anesthetics. Finally, in the document Prolactin synthesized and secreted by human peripheral blood mononuclear cells: an autocrine growth factor for lymphoproliferation., we see that lignocaine is mentioned as a type of local anesthetic, but it's not explicitly stated whether it belongs to the amide group or not. However, based on our knowledge of local anesthetics, we can infer that lignocaine is likely to be an amide-type local anesthetic.\",\n\"answer_choice\": A"]
