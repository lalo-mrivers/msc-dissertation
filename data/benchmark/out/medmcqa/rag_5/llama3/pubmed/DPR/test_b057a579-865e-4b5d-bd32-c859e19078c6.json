["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Since we are looking for the passage of Occulomotor nerve, I will consider the documents that provide information about the anatomy of the orbit or surrounding structures. The first document is about health visitors and campaigning, which does not seem relevant to this question. The second document discusses non-mitochondrial cytochromes c, but it does not mention anything about the Occulomotor nerve.
