["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents provided do not contain information about pharmacokinetic parameters of a drug such as apparent volume of distribution. Therefore, we need to look for clues that might help us make an educated guess. In the 'Quantitative cervical flexor strength in healthy subjects and in subjects with mechanical neck pain' article, there is no mention of drug distribution or any other pharmacokinetic parameter.

In the 'Relationship between ammonia, heart rate, and exertion in McArdle's disease' article, there is no information about a specific drug or its distribution.
