["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks for the most probable diagnosis of a child presenting with multiple permeating lesions involving all bones of the body. None of the relevant documents provided discuss bone lesions or tumors, so we need to rely on general medical knowledge. Neuroblastoma is a type of tumor that can affect bones, but it is typically not disseminated throughout the entire skeleton. Metastasis from osteosarcoma, Wilms' tumor, and histiocytosis X are all possible causes of widespread bone lesions, but histiocytosis X is the most likely given its typical radiological features. The document on solitary osteochondroma does not discuss widespread bone lesions, and the other documents do not provide relevant information for this question.\", \"answer_choice\": C}"]
