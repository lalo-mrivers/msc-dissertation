["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about lipoproteins and their movement in electrophoresis. Electrophoresis separates molecules based on their charge. Lipoproteins have a charged component, which is the lipid moiety. Chylomicrons are triglyceride-rich lipoproteins that contain little to no protein or phospholipid. As they do not have a significant charged component, they would not move towards the charged end in electrophoresis.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
