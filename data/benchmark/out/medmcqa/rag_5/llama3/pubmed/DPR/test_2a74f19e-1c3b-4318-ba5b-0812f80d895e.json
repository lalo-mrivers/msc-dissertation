["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The provided documents are about medical research topics such as thrombin binding to platelets, quality control rules, HIV infection, healthcare costs, and back injury prevention. None of these topics relate to randomization in a clinical trial. Therefore, we need to look for information on randomization from external sources. Randomization is a statistical technique used in clinical trials to minimize confounding variables by dividing subjects randomly into treatment and control groups. It reduces selection bias by ensuring that the probability of being assigned to either group is equal. However, it does not guarantee comparability between the two groups as there may be underlying differences. Moreover, randomization does not directly increase or decrease external validity, which refers to the ability of the trial results to be generalized to other populations.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
