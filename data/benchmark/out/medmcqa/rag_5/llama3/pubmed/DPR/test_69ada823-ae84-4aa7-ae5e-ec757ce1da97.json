["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the most appropriate treatment for a mandibular angle fracture. The relevant documents are not directly related to this specific type of fracture or its treatment. Therefore, I will focus on the general principles and guidelines in orthopedic surgery and trauma management. A mini plate is often used to stabilize small fractures, especially those with minimal displacement. Oblique ridges are a common location for fixation plates in mandibular angle fractures. Two mini plates on the lateral surface of the mandible would be over-engineering and may cause more harm than good. Compression plates are typically used for larger fractures that require more stability. Reconstruction plates are designed to restore bone shape and function, which is not necessary for a simple mandibular angle fracture.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
