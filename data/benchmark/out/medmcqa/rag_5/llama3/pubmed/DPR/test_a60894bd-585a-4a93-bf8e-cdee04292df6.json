["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant document for this question is 'Teaching aids for patients diagnosed with choroidal melanoma'. However, this document does not provide information about proteins elevated in plasma related to myocardial infarction. Therefore, we need to look at other documents. The 'Campaigning for change' document discusses various topics including health issues but does not mention proteins elevated in plasma. Similarly, the 'Organs for transplantation' and '[Pregnancy toxemia]' documents do not provide relevant information. On the other hand, [Spontaneous subcapsular hematoma of the kidney] briefly mentions troponin T as a biomarker for cardiac ischemia, which is a complication of myocardial infarction. Therefore, we can infer that Troponin T is elevated in plasma during myocardial infarction.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
