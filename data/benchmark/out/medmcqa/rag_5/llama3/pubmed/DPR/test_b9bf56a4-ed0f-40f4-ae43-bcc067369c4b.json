["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about orthodontic wire alloy behavior. Permanent bending during clinical application can cause work hardening. This process typically increases the strength of the material (A) and decreases its ductility (B). Internal stresses may also develop (C) due to the deformation. Therefore, all of these effects are plausible consequences of permanent bending.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
