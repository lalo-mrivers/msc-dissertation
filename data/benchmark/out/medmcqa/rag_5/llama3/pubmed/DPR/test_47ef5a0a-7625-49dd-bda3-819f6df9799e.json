["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which structure lies outside the relationship with the left ureter, we need to consider the anatomical location of the left ureter. The left ureter is located in the pelvis and then ascends through the retroperitoneal space to enter the abdomen. It is related to several nearby structures such as the sigmoid colon, iliac vessels, gonadal vessels, and quadratus lumborum muscle. Based on this anatomy, we can eliminate options A (mesentery of sigmoid colon), B (bifurcation of common iliac artery), D (gonadal vessels) as being in close relation to the left ureter. This leaves us with option C (quadratus lumborum) which is an muscle located in the thoracic region and not directly related to the left ureter.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"]
