["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Metoclopramide is a medication commonly used to treat nausea and vomiting. It's known for its antiemetic action. To answer this question, I'll review the provided documents, focusing on any mentions of metoclopramide or its properties. None of the provided documents mention metoclopramide, so I'll need to rely on my general knowledge of the medication. Metoclopramide's primary mechanism of action is through its ability to antagonize dopamine receptors in the chemoreceptor trigger zone (CTZ) and the area postrema (AP), which are responsible for nausea and vomiting. This suggests that the antiemetic action is due to metoclopramide's D2 antagonist property.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
