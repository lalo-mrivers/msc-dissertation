["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's PPH symptoms and laboratory results suggest that the prolonged APTT and PTT are likely related to a coagulopathy. The normal BT, PT, and platelet counts eliminate inherited congenital hemophilia as a possibility. Acquired hemophilia is a condition characterized by the presence of inhibitor antibodies directed against factor VIII, which can cause prolonged APTT and PTT. Lupus anticoagulant can also cause prolonged PTT, but it typically presents with other signs of lupus such as rash, arthritis, and kidney disease. DIC is another possibility given the patient's PPH symptoms, but the normal PT and platelet count suggest that this is unlikely.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
