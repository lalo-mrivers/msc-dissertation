["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Glycogen synthesis and breakdown take place in the same cell, but they are regulated separately. Glycogenesis occurs in the cytoplasm of hepatocytes, whereas glycogenolysis is initiated by hormones such as glucagon or epinephrine, which stimulate phosphorylation and activation of glycogen phosphorylase. Glucose-6-phosphatase is an enzyme that breaks down glucose-6-phosphate into glucose, but it is present in the endoplasmic reticulum, not the cytoplasm where glycogenesis occurs. Therefore, glucose-6-phosphatase cannot immediately degrade the freshly synthesized glucose-6-phosphate during glycogenesis.\", \"answer_choice\": B}"]
