["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about a 14-year-old male child with abnormal body movements and MRI showing signal changes in specific brain regions. The options provided are related to neurological disorders affecting movement. I will analyze each option: A - Parkinsonism is unlikely given the patient's age, as Parkinson's disease typically affects older adults. B - Nigrostriatal degeneration is a condition that affects dopamine-producing neurons and can cause abnormal movements; however, it is not typically seen in children. C - Wilson's disease is a genetic disorder that can cause neurological symptoms, including movement disorders, but the patient's age is inconsistent with typical onset of the disease. D - Hallervorden-Spatz disease is an inherited disorder that can cause childhood-onset movement disorders, which matches the patient's age and MRI findings.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
