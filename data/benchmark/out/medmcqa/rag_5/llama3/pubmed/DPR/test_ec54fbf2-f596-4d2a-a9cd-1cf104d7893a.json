["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about a lesion that disappears when the cheek is stretched. The documents provided are related to rare diseases such as hereditary epidermolysis bullosa, gliomatosis cerebri, spontaneous subcapsular hematoma of the kidney, and complicated hydatid cyst mimicking renal tumor.
