["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has a history of repeated episodes of rheumatic fever, which indicates that they have had an autoimmune response to streptococcal infections. This implies that the patient's immune system is reactive to bacterial cell walls, particularly peptidoglycan. Since the patient is hypersensitive to penicillin, it suggests that they may also be hypersensitive to other beta-lactam antibiotics. Therefore, we need to choose an antibiotic that does not rely on the same mechanism of action as penicillin.\n\nA review of the relevant documents does not provide any specific information about the patient's condition or the antibiotics mentioned in the question. However, based on general knowledge and the context of the question, we can infer that sulfonamide-based antibiotics like sulfisoxazole (option B) and sulfasalazine (option C) are likely to be safe options for this patient.\n\nStreptomycin (option D) is an aminoglycoside antibiotic that targets bacterial protein synthesis. While it is not directly related to the mechanism of action of penicillin, it may still cause allergic reactions in some individuals. Therefore, we cannot confidently recommend streptomycin as the best option for this patient.\n\nPenicillin G (option A) is clearly not a viable option due to the patient's hypersensitivity to penicillin.\n\nIn conclusion, based on our analysis and the information provided, sulfisoxazole (option B) or sulfasalazine (option C) appear to be reasonable choices for treating the patient's infection.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
