["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the rationale of giving glycopyrrolate before anaesthesia. The relevant information comes from the paper 'The effect of beta adrenergic blockade upon exercise-induced changes in blood coagulation and fibrinolysis'. Glycopyrrolate is a medication that antagonizes the effects of acetylcholine, which is involved in the regulation of secretions. Exercise stress stimulates blood coagulation and fibrinolysis possibly as a result of sympatho-adrenal stimulation of the beta adrenergic receptor. Given anaesthesia, patients are also subject to similar physiological changes as exercise. Therefore, glycopyrrolate is given before anaesthesia to decrease secretions.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
