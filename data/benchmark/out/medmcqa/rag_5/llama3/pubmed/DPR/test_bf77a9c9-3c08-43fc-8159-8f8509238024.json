["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Genomic imprinting is a process where genes are expressed based on the parent of origin. The modification involved in this process is a type of epigenetic change. Acetylation, phosphorylation, and deamination are not directly related to genomic imprinting. Methylation is a well-established mechanism for epigenetic regulation in genomic imprinting.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
