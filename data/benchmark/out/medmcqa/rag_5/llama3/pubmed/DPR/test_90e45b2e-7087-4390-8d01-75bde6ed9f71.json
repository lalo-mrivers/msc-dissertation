["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Since the question is about treating diastema caused by a thick labial frenum, I need to consider the relationship between the frenum and the development of the mouth. The frenum is a band of tissue that connects the upper lip to the gum, and its thickness can cause a gap or diastema in the front teeth. Therefore, I need to think about when the frenum's impact on the mouth is most significant. Typically, this is during the early development of the oral cavity, specifically before the eruption of permanent teeth. Frenectomy, which is surgical removal of part or all of the frenum, may be necessary to correct the diastema and promote proper alignment of the front teeth. Thus, the treatment should occur before the eruption of canines.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B: Before eruption of canines\""]
