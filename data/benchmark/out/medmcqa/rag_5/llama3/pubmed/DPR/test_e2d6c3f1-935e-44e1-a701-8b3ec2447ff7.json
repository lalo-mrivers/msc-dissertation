["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, I will consider the changes that occur during pregnancy. According to various sources, including 'Re-evaluation of practice reaps positive results' and 'Respiratory measurements. 2: Interpreting simple measurements of lung function', pregnancy is a time of significant physiological change.\n\nOne key factor is the increase in stroke volume, which leads to increased cardiac output (CO). This is because the heart has to pump more blood to meet the needs of the growing fetus and placenta. The 'Developing a clinical hypermedia corpus: experiences from the use of a practice-centered method' paper also highlights the changes that occur during pregnancy.\n\nThe other options, such as increased intravascular volume and peripheral resistance, are not directly related to changes in cardiovascular physiology during pregnancy.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
