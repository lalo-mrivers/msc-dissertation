["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about building up a core on a molar tooth using chemically cured composite. We are looking for the most appropriate reason why it should be done with this type of material. None of the provided documents relate to dentistry, so we need to rely on our general knowledge. Chemically cured composites have a higher viscosity than light cure resins, which allows them to flow less easily around pins and posts. This makes them more suitable for building up cores in dental restorations. Therefore, option D is the most logical choice.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
