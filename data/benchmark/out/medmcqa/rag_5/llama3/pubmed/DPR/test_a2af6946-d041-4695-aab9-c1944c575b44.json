["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the CRISPR-Cas 9 system, which is a gene editing tool. The question is asking about the repair mechanism used for genome editing. After reviewing the provided documents, I did not find any information related to the CRISPR-Cas 9 system or genome editing. Therefore, I will rely on my general knowledge of molecular biology and genetics. In the context of DNA double-strand breaks caused by CRISPR-Cas 9, the repair mechanism used is Non Homologous End Repair (NHEJ).\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
