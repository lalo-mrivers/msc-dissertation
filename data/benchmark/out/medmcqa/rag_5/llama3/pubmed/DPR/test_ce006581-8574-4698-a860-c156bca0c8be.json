["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To calculate the 95% confidence interval (CI) for an estimated prevalence of 10% and a sample size of 100, we can use the standard error formula for proportions: SE = sqrt(p*(1-p)/n, where p is the proportion and n is the sample size. Then, using the z-score corresponding to the desired confidence level (95%), we calculate the CI.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
