["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about mandibular fracture management. Mini plates are used to adapt the treatment. Considering the options, load bearing osteosynthesis (A) and rigid osteosynthesis (D) seem relevant, as they both involve some form of fixation or stabilization. Load sharing (B) and non-rigid osteosynthesis (C) do not fit with the concept of using mini plates to manage a mandibular fracture. Therefore, it is likely that option D, Rigid osteosynthesis, is the correct answer.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
