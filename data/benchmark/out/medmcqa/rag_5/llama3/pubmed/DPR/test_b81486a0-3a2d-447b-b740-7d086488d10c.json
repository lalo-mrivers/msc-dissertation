["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the cephalic index of a patient. The cephalic index is defined as the ratio of the maximum breadth of the skull to its maximum length. This index can be used to classify skulls into three categories: brachycephalic (index < 75%), mesocephalic (index 75-80%), and dolicocephalic (index > 80%). Therefore, since more than 80% cephalic index is mentioned in the question, it implies that the patient has a dolicocephalic skull.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
