["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Since amniocentesis is a procedure that involves tapping into the amniotic sac to collect fluid for testing, it's possible that a 'bloody tap' could affect certain measurements. Phosphatidyl glycerol, Î±-fetoprotein, and bilirubin are all measured in amniotic fluid, so they could be affected by a bloody tap. The L/S ratio is also measured in amniotic fluid, but it's a ratio of the lecithin to sphingomyelin levels, which would not be directly affected by blood contamination. Therefore, the only measurement that would not be affected by a bloody tap during amniocentesis is the L/S ratio.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
