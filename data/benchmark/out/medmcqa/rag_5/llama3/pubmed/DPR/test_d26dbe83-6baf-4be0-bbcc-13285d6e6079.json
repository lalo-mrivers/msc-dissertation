["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the nerve that should be avoided during excision of the submandibular gland for calculus or tumours. The relevant document is 'The midline cervical cleft' which does not seem to provide information on this topic. However, another possible relevant document could be 'Solitary osteochondroma presenting as a neck mass with spinal cord compression syndrome'. Upon reviewing this document, it mentions that the patient had a neck mass and it did not specify the exact location of the incision for excision of the submandibular gland. Therefore, we cannot conclude that this document is directly relevant to our question. The next possible relevant document could be 'Multiple linear cylindromas' which also does not provide information on the topic of avoiding a nerve during submandibular gland excision. Finally, we have 'International workshop on non-mitochondrial cytochromes c' which seems unrelated to our question altogether. Therefore, based on the available documents, it is difficult to determine which nerve should be avoided during excision of the submandibular gland for calculus or tumours. We can only provide an answer by eliminating options that are not supported by any information in the relevant documents.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
