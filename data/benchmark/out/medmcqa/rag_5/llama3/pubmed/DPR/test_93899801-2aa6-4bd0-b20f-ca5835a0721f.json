["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents provided discuss various topics such as dental procedures, spinal pathology, cervical clefts, therapeutic manipulation, and periodontal alterations. However, none of these topics directly relate to oral & maxillofacial trauma or cervical injury. The question asks about the preferred method of intubation in a patient with oral & maxillofacial trauma and cervical injury. This information is not provided in the given documents. Therefore, we need to consider general anesthesia guidelines for intubation in trauma patients.\n\nGuidelines suggest that in the presence of potential cervical spine injuries, intubation should be performed using techniques that minimize neck movement and pressure. Fiberoptic intubation (D) would be a good choice as it allows for visualization of the airway without the need to manipulate the patient's head or neck.\n\nNormal laryngoscopy & endotracheal intubation (C) may not be the preferred method in this scenario, as it requires more manipulation and movement of the patient's head and neck. LMA (A) and Combitube (B) are not suitable for patients with potential cervical spine injuries, as they can cause further movement and potential injury to the cervical spine.\n\nBased on these guidelines, fiberoptic intubation (D) is the most appropriate method for intubating a patient with oral & maxillofacial trauma and cervical injury.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
