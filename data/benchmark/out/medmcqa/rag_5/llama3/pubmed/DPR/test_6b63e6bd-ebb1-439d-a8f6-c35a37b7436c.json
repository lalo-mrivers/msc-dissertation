["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To calculate the anion gap, we need to subtract the sum of chloride and bicarbonate from the sum of sodium and potassium. The given values are: Na+ 137, K+ 4, Bicarbonate 15, Chloride 110. First, let's calculate the sum of chloride and bicarbonate: 110 + 15 = 125. Then, let's calculate the sum of sodium and potassium: 137 + 4 = 141. Finally, we subtract the former from the latter to get the anion gap: 141 - 125 = 16.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
