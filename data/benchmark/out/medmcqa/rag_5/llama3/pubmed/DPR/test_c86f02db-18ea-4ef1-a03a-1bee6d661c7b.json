["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about a syndrome caused by uniparental disomy. Uniparental disomy refers to the inheritance of two copies of a chromosome from one parent, with no contribution from the other parent. Prader-Willi syndrome and Angelman syndrome are both syndromes caused by uniparental disomy, specifically paternal uniparental disomy for chromosomes 15. Russell-Silver syndrome is not directly related to uniparental disomy, but rather is a genetic disorder caused by mutation in the NSD1 gene. Bloom syndrome is another genetic disorder caused by mutations in the BLM gene and has no direct relation to uniparental disomy.\", \"answer_choice\": C}"]
