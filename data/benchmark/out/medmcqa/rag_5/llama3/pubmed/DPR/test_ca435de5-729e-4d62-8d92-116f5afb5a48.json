["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the Nernst potential for a negative ion. The concentration of the ion is given as 100 mMoL extracellularly and 10 mMoL/L intracellularly. The Nernst equation relates the concentrations of an ion across a membrane to the equilibrium potential. The equation is E = RT/F * ln([concentration outside]/[concentration inside]), where R is the gas constant, T is the temperature in Kelvin, F is Faraday's constant, and [concentration] are the concentrations on either side of the membrane. Plugging in the given values, we get E = (8.3145 J/mol*K * 310 K) / (96,485 C/mol) * ln(100/10) â‰ˆ -61 mV.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
