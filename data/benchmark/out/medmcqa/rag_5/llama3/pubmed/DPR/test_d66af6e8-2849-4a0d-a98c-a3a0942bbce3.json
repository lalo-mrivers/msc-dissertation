["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about a 6-month-old child with Tetralogy of Fallot who develops a cyanotic spell initiated by crying. Tetralogy of Fallot is a congenital heart defect characterized by an overriding aorta, ventricular septal defect, and pulmonary stenosis. Cyanotic spells in this condition are often due to decreased pulmonary blood flow. Propranolol is often used to treat cyanotic spells in children with Tetralogy of Fallot, as it can help decrease the frequency and severity of these episodes. However, propranolol is contraindicated in patients with left ventricular outflow obstruction (such as those with Tetralogy of Fallot), as it can worsen the condition by decreasing cardiac output. Therefore, Propranolol would be the drug to avoid in this scenario.\", \"answer_choice\": B}"]
