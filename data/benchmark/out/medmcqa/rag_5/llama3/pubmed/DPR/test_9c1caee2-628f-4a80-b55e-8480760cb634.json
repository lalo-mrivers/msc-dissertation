["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the component that sensitizes bacteria and viruses to UV irradiation. After reviewing the documents, I didn't find any direct connection between the provided options (lipids, carbohydrates, inorganic salts) with UV irradiation or bacterial/viral sensitivity.
