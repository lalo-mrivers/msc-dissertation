["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to understand what ASO titre is. It's an antibody titre that measures the level of anti-streptolysin O (ASO) antibodies in the blood. This test is commonly used to diagnose strep throat and rheumatic fever. Now, let's examine each option: A suggests that ASO titre can be increased in school children, which is true. Children with acute rheumatic fever may have an elevated ASO titre due to recent streptococcal infection. B says the titre may be negative in post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis, which is also correct. In this condition, the titre may be low or absent despite previous streptococcal infection. C claims that ASO titre is included in major criteria in Jones criteria, which is incorrect. The Jones criteria are guidelines for diagnosing rheumatic fever and do not involve ASO titre. D states that the titre may not be elevated in 20% cases of carditis, which is true as well. In some cases of carditis (inflammation of the heart), the ASO titre may be normal or low despite a recent streptococcal infection.\", \"answer_choice\": C}"]
