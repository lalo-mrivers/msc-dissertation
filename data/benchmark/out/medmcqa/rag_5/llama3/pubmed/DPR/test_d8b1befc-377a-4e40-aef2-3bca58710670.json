["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with defective hearing and Rinne's test showing air conduction greater than bone conduction on both sides. This suggests a sensorineural hearing loss. The Weber test is lateralized to the right ear, which further supports a conductive component to the hearing loss. The next logical step would be to investigate further the nature of this conductive component.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
