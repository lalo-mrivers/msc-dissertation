["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about abnormalities that can be diagnosed in the 1st trimester of pregnancy. The provided documents are mostly related to medical conditions, but none of them directly address fetal development or diagnosis during the 1st trimester. However, one document mentions acute bacterial meningitis in childhood, which is not relevant to this question. Another document discusses proteoglycans in articular cartilage and their organization, also unrelated to prenatal diagnosis. The last document evaluates the effects of adrenergic agents on calcitonin secretion, again not relevant to fetal development or 1st trimester diagnosis.\n\nThe answer must be found among the potential choices provided: Anencephaly, Encephalocele, Meningocele, and Microcephaly. Among these options, one stands out as potentially diagnosable in the 1st trimester of pregnancy: Anencephaly.\", \n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
