["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about osteoporosis. The provided documents are case reports, quality improvement articles, and a campaign for change article. None of these documents mention osteoporosis or treatment options for it. To answer this question, we need to rely on external knowledge of osteoporosis treatment options.
