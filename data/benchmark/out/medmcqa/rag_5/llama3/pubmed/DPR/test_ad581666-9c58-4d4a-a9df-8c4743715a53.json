["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks for an enzyme that catalyzes the transfer of a molecule group from one molecule to another. Based on this description, I think of enzymes that are involved in molecular transfers. Among the provided documents, I find mention of protein kinases which involve the transfer of phosphate groups. Specifically, the document 'Distinction by sequence analysis between cdc2 protein kinases...' talks about cdc2 proteins being well characterized as protein kinases, which are functionally involved in cell cycle control and specifically mentioned to be protein kinases. This information suggests that the enzyme is likely a protein kinase.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C: Transferases\"\n}"]
