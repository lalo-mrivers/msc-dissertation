["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about antihypertensives that are not safe in pregnancy. The documents provided seem to be unrelated to the topic of antihypertensives and pregnancy. However, I will review each document carefully.\\r\\n\\r\\nDocument 1: Solitary osteochondroma presenting as a neck mass with spinal cord compression syndrome - This is a medical case report about a rare condition in the neck, not related to antihypertensives or pregnancy.\\r\\n\\r\\nDocument 2: The ultimate birth center: a collaborative model for innovation - This is an article about a birth center and its operations, not relevant to the topic of antihypertensives and pregnancy.\\r\\n\\r\\nDocument 3: Periodic solutions of population models in a periodically fluctuating environment - This is a mathematical paper about population modeling, not related to antihypertensives or pregnancy.\\r\\n\\r\\nDocument 4: Glycogen levels of rat ova during cleavage - This is an article about the measurement of glycogen levels in rat eggs during the process of cleavage, not relevant to the topic of antihypertensives and pregnancy.\\r\\n\\r\\nDocument 5: Health care costs and financing in world perspective - This is a general overview of health care costs and financing around the world, not related to antihypertensives or pregnancy.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince none of these documents provide information about antihypertensives and their safety during pregnancy, I will rely on my medical knowledge to answer this question.\\r\\n\\r\\nACE inhibitors like Enalapril are generally considered unsafe in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy due to concerns about fetal development. Amlodipine is a calcium channel blocker that is generally considered safe for use during pregnancy.\\r\\n\\r\\nTherefore, I will choose option B: ACE inhibitors / Enalapril as the antihypertensive that is not safe in pregnancy.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
