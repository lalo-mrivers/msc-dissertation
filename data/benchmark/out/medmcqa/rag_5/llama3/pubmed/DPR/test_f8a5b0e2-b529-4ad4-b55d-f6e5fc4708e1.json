["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To find the positive predictive value of the test, we need to consider the prevalence of the disease (20%) and the sensitivity (95%) as well as specificity (80%) of the screening test. First, we will calculate the true positives: 0.2 x 1900 = 380 (assuming 19,000 people are healthy). Next, we will calculate the false positives: 0.05 x 8,100 = 405. Then, we can find the positive predictive value by dividing the true positives by the sum of true positives and false positives: 380 / 785 = 48.5%. Since this is not an option, we will consider the specificity to find the false negatives: 0.2 x 8,100 = 1,620. Then, we can calculate the negative predictive value: (1 - 0.05) x 9,220 = 93.95%. Since this is not an option either, we need to use the Bayes' theorem to find the positive predictive value: PPV = TP / (TP + FP) = 380 / 785 = 48.5%.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
