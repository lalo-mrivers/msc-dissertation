["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents are a mix of medical studies on different topics. There is no direct mention of excitable cells or repolarization. However, we know that repolarization is an important process in the functioning of many biological systems, including the heart and nervous system. Based on this understanding, we can deduce that repolarization is closely associated with potassium ion (K+) efflux, as it helps to bring the membrane potential back to a resting state.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"]
