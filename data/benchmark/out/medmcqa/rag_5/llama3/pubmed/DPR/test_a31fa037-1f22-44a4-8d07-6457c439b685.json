["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has a CVP line and blood culture shows Gram +ve cocci that are catalase positive and coagulase negative. Catalase positivity suggests the bacteria is not Staphylococcus aureus, as it is typically catalase-negative. Coagulase negativity also points away from Staphylococcus aureus, which is typically coagulase-positive. The combination of Gram +ve cocci and catalase positivity points towards a likely etiological agent that is different from Staphylococcus aureus.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
