["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant document that discusses oral manifestations and association with periodontal alterations is 'Periodontal aspects of hereditary epidermolysis bullosa'. This document does not explicitly discuss specific plaque hypothesis. Therefore, it's necessary to analyze the question options. Option A states that all plaque is pathogenic, which doesn't seem accurate as some people may have plaque without developing periodontitis.

This leaves option B: Only specific micro-organisms are responsible for pathogenicity of plaque.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
