["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the type of fibers present in striated muscle. Striated muscles are voluntary muscles that are innervated by motor neurons. The stretch reflex in these muscles is mediated by proprioceptors, which are sensory receptors that detect changes in muscle length and tension. Proprioceptors are primarily composed of Ia afferent fibers, which are also known as Golgi tendon organs (GTOs). GTOs are the most common type of proprioceptor found in striated muscles.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
