["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents provided do not discuss strain, which is a measure of deformation resulting from an applied load. None of the mentioned conditions or reactions involve applying loads or forces to biological systems. Therefore, we need to consider whether there are any concepts related to force opposition or resistance in the given texts. Upon reviewing the articles, we find that 'peripheral resistance' is discussed in the context of bufuralol HCl's effects on the cardiovascular system. This term seems to be relevant to understanding what strain means. The concept of peripheral resistance is the opposition to the flow of blood through the peripheral vessels. Therefore, we can infer that strain might be related to the internal force opposing an applied load or force in a biological system.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
