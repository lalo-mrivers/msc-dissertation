["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The given information suggests that the patient is a 2-year-old boy with vitamin D refractory rickets. The serum calcium level is normal (9 mg/dl), but phosphate level is low (2.4 mg dl). This suggests that the problem lies in the regulation of phosphate levels rather than calcium. Alkaline phosphatase and parathyroid hormone levels are normal, which further points towards a defect in phosphate metabolism. Based on these findings, the most likely diagnosis would be Hypophosphatemic rickets.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
