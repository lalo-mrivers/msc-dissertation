["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the description of the corneal ulcer with elevated margins, feathery hyphae, finger-like projections, and minimal hypopyon in cornea, I think step-by-step. The presence of hyphae and fungal-like structures suggests an infection caused by a fungus. Acanthamoeba is not a typical cause of eye infections based on the symptoms described. Aspergillosis could be a possibility but it's less common to present with finger-like projections. HSV-1 typically causes viral keratitis and would not present with these specific features.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"]
