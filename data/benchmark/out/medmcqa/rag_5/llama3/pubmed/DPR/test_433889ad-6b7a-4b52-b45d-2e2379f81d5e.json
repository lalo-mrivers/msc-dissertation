["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about which finger has two dorsal interossei. To answer this, we need to recall the anatomy of the hand and fingers. The dorsal interossei are a group of muscles that help abduct (move away from the midline) the fingers. Upon reviewing the relevant documents, I did not find any information related to gait disturbances, quality in occupational health, campaigning for change, or restructuring the system that would aid in answering this question. However, I did find a document about interphase cytogenetic analysis of gliomas, but it is also irrelevant to the question. Therefore, we need to rely on our general knowledge of anatomy to answer this question. The dorsal interossei muscles are most prominent in the first two fingers (index and middle). The index finger has three dorsal interossei muscles, whereas the middle finger has only one. This suggests that the little finger, ring finger, or any other finger do not have two dorsal interossei.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
