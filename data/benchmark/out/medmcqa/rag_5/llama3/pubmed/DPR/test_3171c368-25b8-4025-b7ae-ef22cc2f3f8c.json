["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the provided documents, there is no information related to post-transcriptional modifications of RNA. Therefore, we need to analyze the question's options. Splicing, 5' capping, and 3' polyadenylation are all processes that occur during transcription or shortly after transcription. Glycosylation is a process that occurs at the protein level, not at the RNA level. Thus, glycosylation is not a post-transcriptional modification of RNA.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
