["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the best index to measure cardiac afterload. The given documents are related to immunological mechanisms for tumor prevention, effect of plasma expanders on blood group serological study results, fibrillation of tropoelastin induced by proteoglycan, comparative effect of calcium and adrenergic system on calcitonin secretion in man, and increased antibiotic resistance of Neisseria gonorrhoeae in Korea. None of these documents are directly related to cardiac afterload or any of the given options. Therefore, it's necessary to rely on general knowledge about cardiac afterload measurement. Cardiac afterload is typically measured by total peripheral resistance (TPR) as it represents the pressure exerted by blood flowing through the systemic circulation.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
