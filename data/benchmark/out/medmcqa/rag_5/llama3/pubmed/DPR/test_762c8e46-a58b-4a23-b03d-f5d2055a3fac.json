["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about a lateral sliding flap done on a tooth with roots denuded for 6 years. The key point here is the duration of denudation (6 years). Based on this information, we can infer that the tooth has undergone significant changes in its periodontal ligament fibers.
