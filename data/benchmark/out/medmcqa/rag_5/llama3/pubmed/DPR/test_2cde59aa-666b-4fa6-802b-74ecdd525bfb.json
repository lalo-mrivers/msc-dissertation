["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The case presents a 12-year-old patient with gross hematuria and dysmorphic RBCs 2 days after an upper respiratory tract infection. Given the presence of dysmorphic RBCs, it is likely that the patient has glomerular disease. The differential diagnosis includes IgA nephropathy, post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis (PSGN), and hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). However, given the acute onset after an upper respiratory tract infection, PSGN seems less likely. IgA nephropathy is a common cause of gross hematuria in children, especially following a viral upper respiratory tract infection. The presence of dysmorphic RBCs also supports this diagnosis.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
