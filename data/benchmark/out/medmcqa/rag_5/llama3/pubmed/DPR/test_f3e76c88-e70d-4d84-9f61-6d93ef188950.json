["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about CPR for infants. The sequence mentioned is Compression - Breathing- Airway. This suggests that the correct sequence of actions in CPR for infants is to perform compressions first, followed by breathing and then airway management. This information can be found in standard CPR guidelines. Next, it is stated that 30 chest compressions are given, which implies that the compression phase should last for some time. The ratio of compressions to breaths is 1:15, meaning that one breath should be given after every 15 compressions. The depth of compressions required in infants is specified as 1 1/2 inches, and finally, it is mentioned that the brachial pulse should be assessed in infants.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
