["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking which of the given options does not require 5' capping. From the provided documents, there are no direct references to mRNA or RNA processing. However, we can use general knowledge about RNA biology to approach this question. 5' capping is a process that adds a special structure to the beginning of certain types of RNA molecules, including mRNAs and some small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs). Based on this information, we can eliminate options A, B, and D as they are all related to mRNA or RNA processing. Option C, U6 snRNA, is an exception because it is a type of small nuclear RNA that does not require 5' capping. Therefore, the correct answer is C.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
