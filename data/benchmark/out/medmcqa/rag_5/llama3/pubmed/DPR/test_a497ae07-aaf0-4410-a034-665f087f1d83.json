["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the fusion of the lower two pas of the sternal body. After reviewing the relevant documents, I didn't find any information related to the sternal body or its fusion. Therefore, I will look for general information about skeletal development in children. According to normal developmental milestones, the sternal body usually fuses between 3-6 years old. However, this information is not specific to the lower pas of the sternal body.
