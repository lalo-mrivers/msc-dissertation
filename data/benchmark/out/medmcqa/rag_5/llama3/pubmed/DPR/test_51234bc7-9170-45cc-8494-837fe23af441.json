["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the best study design for comparing fat content in expressed breast milk of pre-term infants vs term infants. Pre-term infants are a specific group with different characteristics than term infants. A case control design involves matching cases (pre-term infants) to controls (term infants), but it wouldn't account for changes over time or within individuals. A prospective cohort would allow us to follow both groups over time, which is important for capturing changes in fat content. Longitudinal study also implies following subjects over time. Ambispective design doesn't seem relevant here. Therefore, a Prospective Cohort (B) or a Longitudinal Study (C) are the most suitable options.\", \"answer_choice\": B}"]
