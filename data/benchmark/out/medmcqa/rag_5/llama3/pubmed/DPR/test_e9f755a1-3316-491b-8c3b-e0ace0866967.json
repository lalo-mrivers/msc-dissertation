["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about a patient who has a distal extension partial denture inserted 3 weeks prior. The patient complains of sensitivity to chewing pressure. This sensitivity could be due to several reasons related to the denture itself or its interaction with the surrounding teeth and tissues. We need to analyze each option carefully.\n\nOption A, improper occlusion, is possible but does not directly relate to the complaint of sensitivity to chewing pressure. Option B, abrasion of tooth by clasp, is also a possibility as it is known that dentures can cause wear on adjacent natural teeth. However, this would likely cause more general discomfort rather than specifically sensitivity to chewing pressure.\n\nOption C, wearing off the cement base, could potentially cause sensitivity if the denture becomes loose or malpositioned, but it's not directly related to chewing pressure either.\n\nOption D, passive retentive arm, is a type of design feature in partial dentures that can cause discomfort and sensitivity. This arm is designed to prevent food accumulation under the denture, but it can also irritate the surrounding tissues, causing sensitivity to chewing pressure.\n\nConsidering all options carefully, I believe option D, passive retentive arm, is the most probable reason for the patient's complaint of sensitivity to chewing pressure.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
