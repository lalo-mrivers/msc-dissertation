["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents provided are unrelated to iron absorption or transport. However, we can approach this question by considering general knowledge about iron uptake. Iron is taken up into enterocytes through a process called endocytosis. This process involves the binding of iron ions to specific transport proteins on the surface of enterocytes. One such protein is DMT-1 (divalent metal transporter 1), which is responsible for iron uptake in the duodenum. Therefore, we can infer that the correct answer is B: DMT-1.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
