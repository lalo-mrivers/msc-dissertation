["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is an 8-year-old child with a non-vital pulp (no response to pulp stimulation) due to a fractured maxillary central incisor. Since there's no periapical lesion in the radiograph, it suggests that the pulp has been isolated and the inflammation has subsided. The goal of treatment is to restore the tooth without causing further damage or complications.\n\nConsidering the age of the child and the lack of severe symptoms, a more conservative approach would be suitable. Pulp capping with calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH)2) could be an option to preserve the pulp tissue and prevent further necrosis.\n\nHowever, since the pulp is non-vital and there's no response to stimulation, it's unlikely that the pulp will recover or respond to treatment. Therefore, a more definitive treatment would be necessary to ensure the long-term health of the tooth.\n\nThe presence of a fractured tooth and the need for a more conservative approach suggest that root canal treatment may not be the most suitable option at this stage. Instead, a pulpotomy or apexification procedure might be considered to stabilize the pulp and prevent further complications.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: Complete debridement and apexification\""]
