["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the usefulness of a screening test. A screening test's usefulness depends on its ability to accurately identify true positives (diseased individuals) and true negatives (non-diseased individuals). This makes sense, as a screening test that consistently identifies diseased individuals but also incorrectly identifies non-diseased individuals would not be useful. Similarly, a test that correctly identifies non-diseased individuals but incorrectly identifies diseased individuals would also not be useful. Therefore, the correct answer is the ability of a screening test to accurately identify both true positives and true negatives.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
