["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Since none of the provided documents mention porcelain or any materials related to it, I will analyze each option individually. The term 'porcelain' typically refers to a type of ceramic material. Silica is a common component in ceramics, including porcelain, so it's likely present. Feldspar and calcium carbonate are also common minerals found in ceramics.

Therefore, I will choose an option that is not related to ceramics or materials science.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
