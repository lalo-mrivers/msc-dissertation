["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is infertile with a normal HSG, suggesting that the issue lies with the semen rather than the vas deferens or epididymis. The presence of azoospermia on semen analysis implies that there are no sperm present in the ejaculate. Given these findings, it is necessary to determine whether the cause is testicular failure (i.e., lack of sperm production) or a blockage at some point along the path from the testes to the urethra. Testicular failure would be characterized by elevated FSH levels, while vas deferens obstruction would not. Therefore, the diagnostic test to differentiate between these two possibilities would be Serum FSH.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
