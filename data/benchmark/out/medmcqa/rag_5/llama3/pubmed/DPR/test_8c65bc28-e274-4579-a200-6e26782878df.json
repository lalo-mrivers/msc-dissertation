["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"This question is about the causes of true open bite. The provided documents are mostly related to various medical conditions such as asthma, kidney subcapsular hematoma, lymphangioma of the lung, and spinal manipulation. None of these documents mention anything about maxillofacial fractures or jaw bone fractures which are relevant to this question. Therefore, we need to look beyond these documents for a possible answer. The option A 'Horizontal fracture of the maxilla' seems plausible as it could cause an open bite. However, options B and C relate to mandibular fractures which would not typically cause an open bite. Option D 'Fracture of mandibular symphysis' also doesn't seem directly related to a true open bite. Therefore, based on the available information, option A seems the most likely cause of true open bite.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
