["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"I will review the relevant documents to find information about dura mater and blood supply. The document 'Chorea and ballism' does not seem directly related to my search. The document 'Eyeglasses and common complaints' is also unrelated. In the document 'Chemometrics in pharmaceutical analysis', there are no mentions of dura mater or blood supply. However, I found the document 'Computers in dental practice management' which discusses dental practices, but it does not provide information about blood supply to the dura mater either. The document 'Campaigning for change' is not related to my search at all. Therefore, I will look at the anatomical structure of the meningeal arteries. The middle meningeal aery, meningual branch of internal carotid aery in posterior cranial fossa and accessory meningeal aery supply dura mater. The anterior and posterior ethmoidal aeries do not supply dura mater, they are branches of the ophthalmic aery that supply the nasal cavity and sinuses respectively.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
