["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about inheritance patterns where the father's condition does not affect the offspring but the mother's condition always affects the offspring. The options are A: Mitochondrial, B: X linked recessive, C: Autosomal dominant, and D: Autosomal recessive. Mitochondrial inheritance is a possibility as it follows maternal inheritance. However, if the father is affected and no offspring is affected, but all offspring are affected when the mother is affected, this suggests that the inheritance pattern is due to the mother's mitochondria. Therefore, A: Mitochondrial is the correct answer.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
