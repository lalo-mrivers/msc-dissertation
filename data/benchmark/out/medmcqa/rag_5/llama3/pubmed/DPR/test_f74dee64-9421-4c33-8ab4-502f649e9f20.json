["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the differences between primary and secondary teeth. The relevant documents provided do not contain information about dental roots or tooth development. However, we can consider general knowledge about primary and secondary teeth. Primary teeth, also known as baby teeth, start erupting in infancy and are gradually replaced by permanent teeth. Secondary teeth, on the other hand, are the permanent teeth that will remain throughout a person's lifetime. The main difference between them is their size, shape, and function.\n\nThe provided question states that primary roots are more divergent and flaring, which implies that the focus is on dental roots. This information can be found in documents about dentistry or oral anatomy. Unfortunately, no relevant information was found among the provided documents.\", \"answer_choice\": D}"]
