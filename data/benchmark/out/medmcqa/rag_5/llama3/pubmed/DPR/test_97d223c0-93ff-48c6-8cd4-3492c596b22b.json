["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The calculation of pulmonary compliance involves finding the change in volume (ΔV) for a given change in pressure (ΔP). The formula is ΔV/ΔP. In this case, we are given the tidal volume (500 mL), but not the actual change in pressure. However, we can use the information about the intrapleural pressures to find the change in pressure. Before inspiration, the pressure was -4 cm of water, and after inspiration, it was -9 cm of water. This is a change of 5 cm of water. Since there is no additional information provided, we will assume that this change in pressure is related to the tidal volume. Therefore, we can use this value for ΔP. We still need to find ΔV. The tidal volume (500 mL) is given as the total amount of air moved into the lungs during inspiration. Since this is a single breath, it's likely that most of the air moves into the lungs quickly, and then there is some residual volume remaining. This means that the actual change in volume is less than 500 mL. However, we don't have enough information to accurately calculate this value. Therefore, we will use the given tidal volume as our ΔV.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C: 0.2 L/cm\""]
