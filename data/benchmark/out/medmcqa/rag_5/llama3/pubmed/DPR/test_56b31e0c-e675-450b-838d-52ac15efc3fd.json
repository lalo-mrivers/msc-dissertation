["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the transmission of HIV from mother to child. The provided documents are related to various medical topics such as glycogen levels, beta-adrenergic blockers, antibiotic activities, and protease inhibitors. None of these topics directly relate to HIV transmission or prevention. Therefore, we need to rely on general knowledge and established guidelines for preventing HIV transmission from mother to child.\n\nAccording to the World Health Organization (WHO), the following measures can prevent HIV transmission from mother to child: antiretroviral therapy (ART) to the mother during pregnancy and childbirth, and continued ART to the infant after birth.
