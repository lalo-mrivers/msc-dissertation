["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The problem is to find the minimum sample size required for a confidence interval of 95% with a range of 45-55%. The formula to calculate this is n = (Z^2 \\* (1 - p) \\* p) / e^2, where Z is the z-score corresponding to the desired confidence level, p is the proportion, and e is the margin of error. Given the problem statement, we can plug in the values: Z = 1.96 for a 95% confidence interval, p = 50%, and e = (55-45)/2 = 5%. This gives us n = (1.96^2 \\* (1 - 0.5) \\* 0.5) / 5%^2 â‰ˆ 384. Therefore, the minimum sample size required is approximately 384, which rounds up to 400.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D: 400\"}"]
