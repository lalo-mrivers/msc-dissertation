["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about a continuous murmur that can be heard in all except one option. The options are related to congenital heart defects or fistulas. A VSD (ventricular septal defect) with aoic regurgitation typically produces a holosystolic murmur, not a continuous murmur.

Patent ductus aeriosus is the most likely option to produce a continuous murmur.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
