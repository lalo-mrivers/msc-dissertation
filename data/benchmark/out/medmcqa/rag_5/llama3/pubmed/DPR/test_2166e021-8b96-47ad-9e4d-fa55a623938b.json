["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the situations where there is high failure in the interpretation of tuberculin test. Based on my knowledge, I understand that the test measures the reaction to a specific antigen of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The reaction can be anergy or positivity. Anergy means no reaction, which can occur due to various reasons like immunosuppression, previous BCG vaccination, or underlying diseases. Positivity indicates exposure to M. tuberculosis.\n\nHigh failure in interpretation might mean that the test is not accurately indicating the presence of the disease. In this case, the situation with high percentage of immunized people (Option A) could be a possible answer. This is because BCG vaccine can cause anergy to the tuberculin test, making it difficult to interpret.\n\nHowever, let's analyze other options as well. Option B mentions HIV cases being less, which doesn't seem relevant to the interpretation of tuberculin tests.\n\nOptions C and D seem unrelated to the accuracy of tuberculin test results.\n\nBased on this analysis, I conclude that high percentage of immunized people (Option A) is a situation where there is high failure in the interpretation of the test.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
