["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is diagnosed with an ovarian cyst in the first trimester. Ovarian cysts are common during pregnancy, and most of them resolve spontaneously. Surgical removal is generally recommended for cysts that are complex or persistent after the first trimester. In this case, since it's early in the pregnancy, observation would be a reasonable option to see if the cyst resolves on its own. Termination of pregnancy is not indicated unless there are other complications. Surgical removal in the second trimester could be considered, but removing it during delivery may not be ideal as it could lead to bleeding or infection.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
