["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the body surface area (BSA) involved in a child with flame burns. The BSA is typically calculated using the Lund and Browder chart or the Morel-Fatio method. Both methods require calculating the percentage of burned skin on different parts of the body, including the head, trunk, and limbs. In this case, the burns involve the face, bilateral upper limbs, and front of chest and abdomen, which are all significant areas that contribute to the total BSA. Therefore, we need to estimate the percentage of burned skin in these areas to calculate the total BSA.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"]
