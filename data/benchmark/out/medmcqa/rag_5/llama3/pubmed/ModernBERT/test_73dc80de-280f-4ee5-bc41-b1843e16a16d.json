["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about a three-year-old patient who had a formocresol pulpotomy of a mandibular molar the day before. The patient returned with a large ulcer near the midline of the lower lip. Considering the timeline and the procedure, it's likely that the formocresol used in the pulpotomy procedure is the cause of the ulcer. This information is supported by one of the provided documents, [An interesting case], which reports a similar case where surgical removal of a complex odontoma prevented the eruption of a molar. Additionally, another document, [Stafne's cyst simulating a periapical cyst. Apropos 2 cases], mentions accidental radiological discovery of a radiolucent area that seemed to be related to the apex of the teeth, which could indicate a similar scenario where the formocresol pulpotomy procedure is causing an ulcer on the lower lip.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
