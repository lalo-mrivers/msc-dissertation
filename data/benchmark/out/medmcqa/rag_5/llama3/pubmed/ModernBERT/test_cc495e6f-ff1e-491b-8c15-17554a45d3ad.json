["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the 'forgotten rotator cuff muscle' which has been ignored or less importance has been attached to its role. The relevant documents mention muscles related to the neck and shoulder joint. Articularis genus is a separate muscle that elevates the capsule and synovial membrane of the knee joint, preventing them from being pinched during extension of the leg. This function is not directly related to the rotator cuff muscles. The biomechanic document discusses the power of the neck-muscles and the position of the head, but does not mention the rotator cuff muscles.\n\nThe article on fiber types and metabolic potentials of skeletal muscles in sedentary man and endurance runners does not provide information about specific muscles. The article on corticospinal, rubrospinal and rubro-olivary projections: a unifying hypothesis discusses motor pathways and their functional properties, but does not mention the rotator cuff muscles.\n\nThe model for measuring the power of the neck-muscles mentioned in the biomechanic document could potentially be applied to other joints, including the shoulder joint. However, it does not provide information about specific muscles or their role in joint stability.\n\nTherefore, based on the provided documents, the answer is likely related to a muscle involved in joint stability and movement around the shoulder joint.\", \n\"answer_choice\": \"D: Subscapularis\"\n}"]
