["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, there is no specific information about the electrical conductivity speed of A α fibres. The first document talks about passive conduction in syncitial symmetric structures, the second document discusses velocity of passive conductance in a branching fiber, and the other two documents discuss voltage clamping and dimensional accuracy of small gold alloy castings. None of these documents seem to be relevant to the electrical conductivity speed of A α fibres. Therefore, I will rely on general knowledge and assume that A α fibres are type of nerve fibers with specific conduction velocities.\", \"answer_choice\": D}"]
