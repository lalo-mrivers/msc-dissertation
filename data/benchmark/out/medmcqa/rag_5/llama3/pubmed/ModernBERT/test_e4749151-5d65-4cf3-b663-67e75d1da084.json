["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about a young male presenting with loose motions and intermittent abdominal pain. The wet mount stool specimen showed the presence of multiple ova which are more than 100u in diameter. This suggests an intestinal parasitic infection. Based on the provided documents, we can rule out Myospherulosis as it is not related to intestinal parasites. Shaky leg syndrome and hip lesions in turkeys does not provide any information about intestinal parasites. Ophthalmomyiasis externa: a case report does not mention anything about intestinal parasites either. Failure to thrive reports on a foreign body removed from the oesophagus, which is not relevant to this question. Werner's syndrome provides some information about clinical characteristics but does not relate to intestinal parasites.\n\nThe documents provided include some information about worms and their sizes. Myospherulosis describes fungus-like structures. Shaky leg syndrome and hip lesions in turkeys describe degenerative lesions on the neck of femurs. Ophthalmomyiasis externa: a case report involves larva identified as family Cuterebridae, genus Cuterebra sp. Failure to thrive reports on a \"butterfly\" nut removed from the oesophagus. Werner's syndrome does not provide any information about worms.\n\nBased on these documents, we can conclude that the causative organisms for the disease shall include large worms (more than 100u in diameter) and exclude others. This rules out option B: Gastrodiscoides hominis as it is a genus of intestinal flukes whose species are less than 50u in size.\n\nThe remaining options, A: Fasciola gigantica, C: Echinostoma ilocanum, and D: Opisthorchis viverrini, all describe worms that can be more than 100u in diameter. Therefore, option B: Gastrodiscoides hominis is the correct answer as it does not include large worms (more than 100u in diameter).\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
