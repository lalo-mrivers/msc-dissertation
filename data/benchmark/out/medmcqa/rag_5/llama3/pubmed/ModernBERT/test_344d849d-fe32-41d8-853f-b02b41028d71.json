["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about a 35-year-old male with baldness. The patient has well-defined bald patches with no scarring, and small broken hairs are seen in the surrounding area. This suggests an autoimmune or genetic condition. Androgenetic alopecia can cause hair loss, but it typically involves gradual thinning rather than well-defined patches. Alopecia areata is a possible diagnosis as it often presents with sudden onset of bald patches. Anagen effluvium and telogen effluvium are both causes of diffuse hair loss, not patchy baldness. Given the patient's age and the characteristics of the hair loss, I think alopecia areata is the most likely diagnosis.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
