["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents discuss healthcare restructuring, multi-institutional arrangements, and government initiatives. The question is about a government initiative to improve labour room facilities. Since Ayushman Bharat Scheme does not specifically focus on labour room improvements, it can be ruled out.
