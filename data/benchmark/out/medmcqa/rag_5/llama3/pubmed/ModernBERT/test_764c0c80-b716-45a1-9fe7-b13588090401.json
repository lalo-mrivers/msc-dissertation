["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the central value of a set of 180 values. Central values can be median (2nd quartile) or mode if the data is categorical, but since there are 180 values and no information about the distribution, I assume it's a quantitative dataset. In this case, the mean might also be considered as a central value, but for 180 values, I think the median would be more representative as it's less affected by outliers. Therefore, I'm going to choose an option related to quartiles.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"]
