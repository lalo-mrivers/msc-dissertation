["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the management of transverse symphyseal fracture of mandible. None of the provided documents specifically address this type of fracture. However, we can consider the general principles of managing mandibular fractures. Supra-condylar fractures in children are mentioned in one of the documents, but it does not provide information on managing transverse symphyseal fractures.\n\nThe document on Luxatio pedis subtalo is irrelevant to the question. The other two documents do not mention mandibular fractures at all.\n\nConsidering these points, we can conclude that the answer should be a method that is not specifically designed for managing mandibular fractures, but could still be used in theory.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
