["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for the sequence of auditory pathway from peripheral to central. The provided documents describe different aspects of anatomy and physiology, but none of them directly mention the auditory pathway. However, we can make an educated guess based on general knowledge. The cochlear nucleus is a structure in the brainstem that receives input from the cochlea, which is responsible for sound processing. The inferior colliculus is a midbrain structure that processes auditory information. The medial geniculate body is a thalamus structure that relays auditory information to the auditory cortex. Finally, the auditory coex refers to the primary auditory cortex.\n\nConsidering this information, we can arrange the sequence of auditory pathway from peripheral to central as follows: cochlear nucleus -> inferior colliculus -> medial geniculate body -> auditory coex.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
