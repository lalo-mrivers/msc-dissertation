["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the radiological feature of transient tachypnea of newborn. None of the given documents are directly related to this condition. However, we can analyze each document and see if there's any mention of radiological features or any conditions that might be similar to transient tachypnea of newborn. The first document is about a voluminous ovarian cyst in a newborn girl, which doesn't seem relevant. The second document discusses antilymphoid activity of leptospiral exoproducts and has nothing to do with radiology. The third document is about binocular dissociated acquired nystagmus of unknown origin, which also isn't related to the condition. The fourth document discusses giant cerebral evoked potentials in a case of brain stem tumor and hydrocephaly, but it's not directly relevant either. Therefore, we can conclude that none of the given documents provide information about the radiological feature of transient tachypnea of newborn.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
