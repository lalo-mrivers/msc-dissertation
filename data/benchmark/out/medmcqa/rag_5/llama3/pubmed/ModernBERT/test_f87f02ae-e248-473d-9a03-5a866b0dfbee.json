["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, I will review the relevant documents. Since there are no documents specifically discussing LDL receptor, I will look for information related to lipoproteins or receptors. The document 'Message in a bottle' does not provide any relevant information. The paper 'Selected promising radiological imaging techniques (author's transl)' discusses computerized axial tomography and is unrelated to LDL receptor. The document 'Remembering the ribosome' reviews Orgel's hypothesis on ribosomes, which is also irrelevant to LDL receptors. The case study '[Burkitt's lymphoma]' provides information about a specific type of cancer, but does not mention LDL receptors. Finally, the paper 'More on the care and feeding of the Padgett dermatome' discusses the use and care of a dermatome and does not provide any relevant information about LDL receptors.\n\nAfter reviewing the documents, I will focus on what is known about LDL receptor from general knowledge. LDL receptor recognizes apo B100 and apo E.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
