["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the direction of force by class III elastic in face mask. The relevant documents mention different types of traction, electromyography, ventilation methods, modeling human spatial movement and forces developed on stretching bands. However, none of these topics seem directly related to the direction of force by class III elastic in a face mask. We need to look for any document that might be discussing the properties or application of such an elastic material. After reviewing all documents, we find one that seems relevant: [Measurement of forces in highly elastic regulating rings]. This article presents the forces developed on stretching bands of various sizes to obtain approximate reference values for practice. Since class III elastic is a type of highly elastic material, it's possible that this document might provide some insight into its properties or application. Upon reviewing the content of this article, we find no direct mention of class III elastic in face mask, but we do find tabulated forces developed on stretching bands of various sizes. This makes us think about how these forces might be related to the direction of force by class III elastic in a face mask.\",\n\"answer_choice\": A"]
