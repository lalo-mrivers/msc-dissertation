["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the pathway activated during Prothrombin time (PT) estimation. Based on the provided documents, thromboplastin and calcium are added to platelet-poor plasma. This process involves coagulation factors, specifically prothrombin. The document 'The effect of basic proteins on the haemostatic system of the dog' mentions a fall in the fibrinogen level, which is involved in the PT estimation. Additionally, the document 'Improved method for measuring fibrinogen in plasma...' discusses thrombin-clottable protein technique, which is related to prothrombin and its role in PT estimation. Therefore, it can be inferred that the extrinsic pathway is activated.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
