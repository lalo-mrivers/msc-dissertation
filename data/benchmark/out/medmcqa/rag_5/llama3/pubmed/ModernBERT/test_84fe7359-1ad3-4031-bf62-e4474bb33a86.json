["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for signs of impending Eisenmenger's syndrome. Eisenmenger's syndrome is a complication that occurs when the defects in heart septa are severe enough to cause pulmonary hypertension. This leads to a reversal of blood flow between the right and left ventricles, which can be fatal if not treated. Reviewing the given documents, I did not find any information specifically related to Eisenmenger's syndrome or its signs. Therefore, I will have to rely on general knowledge to answer this question. An increased flow murmur across the tricuspid and pulmonary valves is a sign of pulmonary hypertension, which is a characteristic of Eisenmenger's syndrome. A single S2 (second heart sound) is normal. A loud P2 (pulmonary second sound) could be a sign of pulmonary hypertension but it is not exclusive to Eisenmenger's syndrome. Graham Steel murmur is not related to pulmonary hypertension or Eisenmenger's syndrome.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
