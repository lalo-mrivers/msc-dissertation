["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks for the minimum haemoglobin level below which 5% of the pregnant females will have their haemoglobin levels. The mean haemoglobin level is 10.6 g/dL and the standard deviation is 2 g/dL. To find the minimum haemoglobin level, we can use the Z-score formula: Z = (x - μ) / σ, where x is the minimum haemoglobin level, μ is the mean haemoglobin level, and σ is the standard deviation. Since we want to find the value below which 5% of the pregnant females will have their haemoglobin levels, we can set Z = -1.645 (since the Z-score for 5% is approximately -1.645). Then, solving for x, we get: x = μ - σ * Z. Plugging in the values, we get: x = 10.6 - 2 * (-1.645) ≈ 8.96.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
