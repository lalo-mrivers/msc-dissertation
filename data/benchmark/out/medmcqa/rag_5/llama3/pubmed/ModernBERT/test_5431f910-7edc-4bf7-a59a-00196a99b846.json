["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"This question is asking about risk of endocarditis. Endocarditis is an infection of the lining of the heart chambers. In order to answer this question, we need to look for information on which type of cardiac lesions are more prone to develop endocarditis.\\nFrom the given documents, there is no direct mention of endocarditis in relation to VSD, MR, AR, or ASD. However, we can look at the document on 'Splenectomy; its results' that mentions a rate of complications amounting to 18.8%. This may not be directly related to endocarditis but it does provide some insight into the risk of infections in general.\\nAnother relevant document is 'Neurological complications of abdominal angiography' which talks about contrast damage to the spinal medulla leading to serious complications. Again, this doesn't specifically mention endocarditis but it shows that certain procedures can lead to serious complications.\\nThere are no other documents provided that specifically discuss endocarditis or its relationship with VSD, MR, AR, or ASD.\\nTherefore, based on the available information, we can conclude that there is no clear indication of which lesion has a higher risk of developing endocarditis. Hence, it's difficult to pinpoint one lesion as being more prone to develop endocarditis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
