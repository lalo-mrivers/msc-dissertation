["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents provided are case reports and discussions on various medical conditions. However, the question specifically asks about acute pyelonephritis. I need to look for relevant information in the documents related to pyelonephritis. Upon reviewing the first document, 'Haematuria in children. III. Treatment of glomerular diseases (author's transl)', I see that it discusses the treatment of acute Glomerulonephritis and Nephrotic Syndrome. Although not specifically focused on pyelonephritis, it does provide some information. Pyelonephritis is an inflammation of the kidneys caused by bacterial infection, often ascending from the urinary tract. Given this context, I'll look for tests that can help diagnose or confirm the presence of bacteria in urine. The second document, 'Tension teratothorax--a case report', doesn't seem relevant to pyelonephritis. The third document, 'Stenosis of the colon', is about colonic stenosis and its differential diagnosis with Hirschsprung's disease, which isn't related to pyelonephritis either. The last document, 'Menkes' kinky hair syndrome', describes a case of Menkes' Syndrome in a Jamaican infant, which doesn't seem relevant at all.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D\n}"]
