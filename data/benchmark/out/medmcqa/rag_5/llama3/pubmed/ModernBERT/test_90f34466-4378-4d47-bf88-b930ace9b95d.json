["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about determining the working length of a maxillary central incisor for an 8-year-old child. The provided documents are about various dental topics such as cephalometric values, fused primary mandibular teeth, and obturator design. However, none of these topics directly relate to the determination of working length. Upon reviewing the documents again, I noticed that the first document mentions axiographic method for assessing cephalometric values. Axiography is a technique used to determine the length of teeth. Therefore, it can be inferred that the most commonly used technique for determining the working length of a maxillary central incisor for an 8-year-old child patient would involve using an axiograph or a similar device.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
