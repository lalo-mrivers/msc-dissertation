["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about a subcondylar fracture, which affects the condyle of the mandible. The possible causes are listed as muscles of mastication (chewing). Since it's a medial dislocation, I'll focus on the medial aspects of these muscles. The lateral pterygoid muscle is located laterally and doesn't fit the description. The masseter muscle is also located laterally and is not a likely cause of medial dislocation. The temporalis muscle is deep to the scalp and doesn't have any direct involvement in this type of fracture.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
