["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Since the question is about the treatment of hypersensitive dentin in molars, we should focus on the relevant documents. The [Modification of the microbial flora in the root canal] and [Magnetic retention for overdentures] documents seem unrelated to this topic. However, the [Prescription of mydriatics in the treatment of dosed-angle glaucoma], [Use of injectable micro-implants in esthetic surgery of the face. Initial report], and the initial report on magnetic retention do not mention any caustic or treatment for hypersensitive dentin. Therefore, we can rule out those documents.
