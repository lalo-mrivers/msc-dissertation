["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's palpitations remain refractory to maximum dose of adenosine, which suggests that the arrhythmia is not caused by supraventricular tachycardia. Since the patient has hypotension (BP 80/50 mmHg) and a fast pulse, it is unlikely that the arrhythmia is ventricular in origin, as ventricular tachycardia typically presents with hypertension. Given the refractory nature of the arrhythmia to adenosine, a vagal maneuver was unsuccessful, and the patient has not had any other specific therapy administered, the next step would be to consider an alternative mechanism for the arrhythmia.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
