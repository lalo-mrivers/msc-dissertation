["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about a 'cut back' incision made on laterally displaced flap. Flaps are pieces of tissue used to cover or repair defects. The key to understanding this question is to consider the anatomy and movement of flaps. A laterally displaced flap would be one that has been moved to the side, likely to create a new space for reconstruction. The 'cut back' incision would therefore be made on the flap itself, rather than the surrounding tissue. This suggests that the incision is made to release tension or reposition the flap.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D\n}"]
