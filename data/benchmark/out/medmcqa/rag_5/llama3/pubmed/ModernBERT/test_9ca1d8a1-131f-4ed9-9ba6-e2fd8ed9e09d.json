["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the retainer of choice for posterior abutments with acceptable crown root ratios, average crown length, and normal esthetic requirements. From the provided documents, none of them specifically discuss this scenario. However, we can infer that the best option would be a dental restoration that provides adequate coverage and support without compromising aesthetics.
