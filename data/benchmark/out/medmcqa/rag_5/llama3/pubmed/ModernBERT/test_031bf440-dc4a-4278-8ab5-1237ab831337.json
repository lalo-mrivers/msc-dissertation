["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Both zinc oxide eugenol cement and polycarboxylate cement are types of dental cements. Zinc oxide eugenol cement is known for its chelation properties, which means it can bind to metal ions such as calcium, magnesium, and phosphate (as seen in the document [Effect of the overload of Sr++ and Ba++ on the association of Ca+, Mg++ and Pi with total proteins (author's transl)]). Similarly, polycarboxylate cement is also known for its chelation properties, which allows it to bond to metal ions such as calcium, magnesium, and phosphate. Therefore, chelation is a common property shared by both zinc oxide eugenol cement and polycarboxylate cement.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
