["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"After reviewing the provided documents, I did not find any information specifically related to Rh isoimmunization or exchange transfusion. However, I can rely on my medical knowledge and general principles of medicine. According to various sources, including guidelines and textbooks, exchange transfusion is typically indicated in cases where the fetus has hemolytic disease due to maternal Rh isoimmunization. Cord blood hemoglobin levels and bilirubin concentrations are used to guide treatment decisions.\n\nCord blood hemoglobin levels less than 10 g% may indicate significant hemolysis, making exchange transfusion necessary. Elevated cord bilirubin levels (>5 mg%) also suggest a need for exchange transfusion to prevent kernicterus. A history of previous sibling affected may not be directly related to the decision-making process in this specific context.\n\nTherefore, considering these general principles and the information available, I will rely on my medical expertise to answer the question.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
