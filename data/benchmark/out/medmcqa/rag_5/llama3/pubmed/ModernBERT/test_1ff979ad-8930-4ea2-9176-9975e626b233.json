["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about which vitamin is synthesized in vivo by humans. Based on the provided documents, niacin is mentioned as being involved in carbohydrate metabolism in one of the studies. This information does not directly address the question, but it provides a connection to niacin.

Therefore, considering only the available information, niacin seems like the most plausible answer.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
