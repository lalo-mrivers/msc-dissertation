["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The case report 'Thyroid autonomy (Plummer's disease) with contralateral malignancy--mere coincidence?' presents a patient with an autonomously functioning nodule in the left lobe and a papillary carcinoma in the right lobe of the thyroid gland. This suggests that papillary carcinoma can occur on one side while another part of the thyroid gland is functioning autonomously. Considering this, we should look for similar information in other case reports.\n\nThe report '[Ectopic mammary gland on the back]' does not provide any relevant information about thyroid nodules or cancer. The reports 'Gorham's disease' and '[Unexpected situations during laparatomia]' do not mention thyroid nodules at all.\n\nTherefore, it is likely that the patient has a bilateral papillary carcinoma, which is supported by the report 'Thyroid autonomy (Plummer's disease) with contralateral malignancy--mere coincidence?'.\n\nThe management of bilateral papillary carcinoma typically involves total thyroidectomy to prevent recurrence and to ensure that any occult nodules are removed. Total thyroidectomy includes removal of both lobes and isthmus of the thyroid gland, whereas right lobectomy only removes one lobe. Radioactive iodine ablation is also contraindicated in a pregnant woman.\n\nThe most suitable option for the management of this patient's bilateral papillary carcinoma during pregnancy is total thyroidectomy.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
