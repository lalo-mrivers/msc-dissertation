["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 2-year-old boy with vitamin D refractory rickets. The investigations show normal serum calcium, phosphate, parathyroid hormone, and bicarbonate levels. This suggests that the patient's condition is not caused by hyperparathyroidism or alkalosis. The presence of hypocalcemia (serum calcium 9 mg/dl) and phosphaturia (phosphate 2.4 mg dl) indicates a possible diagnosis of rickets. The normal parathyroid hormone level excludes hyperparathyroidism as a cause. Given the refractoriness to vitamin D treatment, the most likely diagnosis is hypophosphatemic rickets.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
