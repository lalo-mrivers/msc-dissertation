["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks for a negative acute phase reactant. Acute phase reactants are proteins that increase in response to tissue damage or inflammation. C-reactive protein (CRP) is a positive acute phase reactant, as it increases in response to inflammation. The other options are not typically considered acute phase reactants, but ferritin and haptoglobin are both involved in iron metabolism and may be influenced by inflammation. Albumin is an important serum protein that can be affected by inflammation, but it is not a classic acute phase reactant. Therefore, the answer must be one of the other options.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"]
