["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about jaundice with 50% direct bilirubin and normal LFTs. The first step is to eliminate the options that are related to liver function tests (LFTs). Gilbert syndrome is a condition characterized by unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia, which does not match the given scenario. Glucuronyl transferase deficiency is also unlikely as it would affect all forms of bilirubin, not just direct bilirubin. Rotor syndrome is a condition where the liver secretes an abnormal amount of conjugated bilirubin into the bile, resulting in high levels of direct bilirubin. Primary biliary cirrhosis is a chronic autoimmune liver disease that can cause jaundice and elevated LFTs, but it's not directly related to the given scenario.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
