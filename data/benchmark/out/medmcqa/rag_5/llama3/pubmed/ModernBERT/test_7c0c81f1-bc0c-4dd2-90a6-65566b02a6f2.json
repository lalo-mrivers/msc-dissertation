["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about cells with greatest affinity to bisphosphonates. Bisphosphonates are compounds that bind to polyphosphate binding site of hemoglobin. The document 'Oxygenation properties of hemoglobin variants with substitutions near the polyphosphate binding site' suggests that substitutions at beta 79 and beta 80 increase oxygen affinity but do not affect response to organic phosphates like bisphosphonates. This implies that cells with greatest affinity to bisphosphonates are those that respond to these compounds, which is likely related to bone metabolism as bisphosphonates have been used in the treatment of osteoporosis. Therefore, the answer is likely related to cells involved in bone remodeling.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
