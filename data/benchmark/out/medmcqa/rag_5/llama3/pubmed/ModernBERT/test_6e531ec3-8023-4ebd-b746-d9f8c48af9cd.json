["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about non-radiographic methods for determining working length. Considering the provided documents, I found that 'Experimental measurement of maximum torque capacity of long bones' does not relate to working length determination. 'Twenty degree angle modification for pelvimetry' and 'Method of investigation of deviations from the normal duration of the cardiac cycle' are also not relevant. However, 'An equipment logging system' and 'Sound-field hearing tests' do not provide any information about working length determination either. This leaves us with only one document remaining: 'Twenty degree angle modification for pelvimetry', which is actually a technique used in pelvimetry (pelvic measurement), but it does not directly relate to determining working length. Therefore, the answer must be found in another field.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"]
