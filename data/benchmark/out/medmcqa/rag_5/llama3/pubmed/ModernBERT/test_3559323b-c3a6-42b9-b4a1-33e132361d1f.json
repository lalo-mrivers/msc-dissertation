["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about numbness on shaving after parotidectomy. Parotidectomy is a surgical procedure that involves removing the parotid gland, which is located near the facial nerve and the auriculotemporal nerve. The patient experiences numbness while shaving after parotidectomy, suggesting damage to a nerve responsible for sensation in this area.
