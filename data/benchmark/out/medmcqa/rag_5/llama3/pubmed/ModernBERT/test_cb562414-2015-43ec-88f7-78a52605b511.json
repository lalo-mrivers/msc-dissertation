["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the management of anaphylaxis, which involves adrenaline. The relevant documents don't provide detailed information on anaphylaxis treatment, but they mention specific actions of beta-blocking drugs like Pindolol in preventing arrhythmias during heart catheterization. This doesn't seem directly related to the effects of adrenaline. Considering the possible choices, A (Bronchodilation by beta-receptors), B (Cardiovascular effects of beta-receptors) and C (Action on blood vessels by alpha-receptors) are all actions of adrenaline, whereas D (Action on presynaptic alpha-receptors) is not a primary effect of adrenaline.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
