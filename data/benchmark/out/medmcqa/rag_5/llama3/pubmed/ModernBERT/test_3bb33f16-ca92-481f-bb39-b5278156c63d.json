["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has increased PT, APTT & TT, indicating a coagulopathy. Since platelet counts are normal and fibrinogen levels are also normal, the main concern is with the clotting factors. Liver disease can cause abnormal clotting tests but would typically be accompanied by other liver function abnormalities. Vitamin K deficiency could cause similar changes, but it would usually manifest as bleeding rather than a coagulopathy. Factor VIII deficiency would not explain the increased TT and APTT. DIC (Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation) is the most likely diagnosis given the combination of abnormal clotting tests.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
