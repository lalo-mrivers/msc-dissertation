["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks to identify complications that are more common in ventouse assisted delivery than forceps. The provided documents do not specifically discuss ventouse assisted delivery or forceps. However, we can look for relevant information on potential complications of obstetric procedures. We see that one of the documents discusses a rare complication following a dural tap in labour: cerebrospinal fluid was aspirated although a catheter was properly re-inserted into the peridural space. This suggests that intracranial hemorrhage is a possible complication. Another document mentions posterior urethral valves, which are not relevant to this question.\n\nLet's examine the options provided for the question. Subgaleal hemorrhage and cephalhematoma could be complications of obstetric procedures. Transient lateral rectus palsy seems less likely to be a complication of ventouse assisted delivery or forceps.\n\nBased on the information available, C: Intracranial hemorrhage is more common in ventouse assisted delivery than forceps.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
