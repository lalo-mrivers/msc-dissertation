["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the minimum sample size required for the study. First, we need to know that the prevalence of disease is expected to be 50%. The investigator wants to estimate the range of 45 to 55% with 95% confidence. This means we need to calculate the margin of error (MOE) and then use it to determine the minimum sample size required.\n\nThe formula for calculating MOE is: MOE = Z \\* sqrt((p*(1-p))/n), where p is the expected prevalence, Z is the Z-score corresponding to the desired confidence level, and n is the minimum sample size.\n\nGiven that the investigator wants 95% confidence, the Z-score corresponding to this confidence level is approximately 1.96. Plugging in the values, we get: MOE = 1.96 \\* sqrt((0.5*(1-0.5))/n).\n\nTo estimate the range of 45 to 55%, we want the MOE to be half of the difference between these two values (10%). So, MOE = 5%.\n\nNow, we can solve for n: 1.96 \\* sqrt((0.5*(1-0.5))/n) = 5%. This gives us approximately 384.\n\nSince the investigator wants to estimate the range of 45 to 55% with 95% confidence, they need a minimum sample size of at least 384.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: 400\"\n}"]
