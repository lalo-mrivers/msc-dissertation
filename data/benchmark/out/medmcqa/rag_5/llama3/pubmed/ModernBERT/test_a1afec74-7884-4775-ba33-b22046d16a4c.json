["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Patient with Type I diabetes mellitus has polyuria which is a characteristic symptom of uncontrolled hyperglycemia. In this patient's body, glucose is not being effectively utilized by the cells due to lack of insulin. This leads to high blood sugar levels and subsequent increased urine production (polyuria). As a result, glycogenesis in muscle (option A) will not occur normally as there is no insulin to facilitate glucose uptake. Protein synthesis (option B) may be decreased or unaffected as hyperglycemia does not directly affect protein metabolism. Conversion of fatty acid to acetyl CoA (option C) might be increased as the body tries to utilize alternative energy sources in the absence of glucose. Decreased cholesterol synthesis (option D) is a possible outcome due to the inhibitory effect of high glucose levels on the HMG-CoA reductase enzyme involved in cholesterol biosynthesis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
