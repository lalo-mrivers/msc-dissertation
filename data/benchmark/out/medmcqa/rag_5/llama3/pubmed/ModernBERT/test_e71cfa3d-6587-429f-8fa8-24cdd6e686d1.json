["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about apical constriction being enlarged to a 50-sized instrument. This implies that the preparation has reached the apical third of the tooth. The goal now would be to further constrict or refine the preparation. Reverse filing technique would likely create more problems, and larger instruments would not fit at this stage. A 50 mm cone is not a typical instrument used in biomechanical preparation. Given these options, using a smaller instrument to fill with a 40-sized cone makes the most sense.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
