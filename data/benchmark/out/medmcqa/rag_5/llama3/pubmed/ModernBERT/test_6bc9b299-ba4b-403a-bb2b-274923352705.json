["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Since the question is about cholesterol crystals, we should look for relevant information related to cholesterol. Upon reviewing the documents, we find that cholesterol is not mentioned in most of them. However, one document mentions calcium oxalate crystals being found in a patient with phacolytic glaucoma.
