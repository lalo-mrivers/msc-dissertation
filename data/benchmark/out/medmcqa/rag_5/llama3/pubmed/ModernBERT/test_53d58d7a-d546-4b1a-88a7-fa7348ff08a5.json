["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Since the question is about secondary colonizers, I will first look for information related to oral health or bacteria that are typically found in the mouth. Among the provided documents, 'A pictorial concordance to important psychologists, 1600-1967' and 'United they fall, divided they stand' seem unrelated to this topic. The document '[Permanence of the endemy of human anthrax in Lower Casamance (author's transl)]' discusses a specific disease, but it does not provide information about oral health or bacteria that are typically found in the mouth. The document '[On the salmonellosis. Data, considerations and operative indications (author's transl)]' presents data on salmonellosis, which is a different type of infection. Therefore, I will focus on the documents that discuss bacterial infections or oral health. Unfortunately, none of the provided documents contain information about S. sanguis, P. intermedia, Fusobacteria, or P. gingivalis. However, according to various sources, Fusobacterium and Porphyromonas are commonly found in the mouth and are part of the normal oral flora. They can be considered as primary colonizers, whereas Streptococcus sanguinis is also a part of the normal oral flora but can cause opportunistic infections. Therefore, I will assume that the question refers to bacteria that are typically found in the mouth and are not usually associated with secondary colonization. This information leads me to conclude that all the given options are primary colonizers except one which could be considered as a secondary colonizer based on available knowledge.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
