["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the effect of prolonged sodium channel inactivation on nerve conduction. From the provided documents, we can see that prolonged sodium channel inactivation would lead to a decreased availability of sodium channels for subsequent action potentials. This would result in a decrease in the velocity and amplitude of nerve impulses, as well as an increase in the relative refractory period.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
