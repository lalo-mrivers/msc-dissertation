["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks for the drug of choice for treating an infection involving non-penicillinase producing staphylococcus. From the given documents, it can be inferred that penicillin and ampicillin are ineffective against such strains due to their resistance to these antibiotics (document: [Microbial and resistance spectrum of jaw infections]). Therefore, Penicillin G is ruled out as an option. The other options include Ampicillin, which is also ruled out because the infection involves non-penicillinase producing staphylococcus, meaning it would not be effective. Erythromycin could be a possibility but methicillin sodium is specifically mentioned in the document [Microbial and resistance spectrum of jaw infections] as a drug effective against staphylococcus that has developed a resistance to penicillin and ampicillin.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
