["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The posterior triangle of the neck is bounded by the sternocleidomastoid muscle anteriorly, the trapezius muscle posteriorly, and the clavicle inferiorly. Referring to the anatomy of this region, we can eliminate options B (Subclavian nerve) and D (Hypoglossal nerve), as they are not present in the posterior triangle of the neck.
