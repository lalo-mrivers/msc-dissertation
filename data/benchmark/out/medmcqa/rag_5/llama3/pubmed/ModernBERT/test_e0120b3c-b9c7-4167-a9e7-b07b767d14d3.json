["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the ideal time for non-stress test (NST) monitoring in a non-diabetic high-risk pregnancy. Considering that the given documents mainly discuss various aspects of fetal health and gestational diabetes, we can infer that NST is related to fetal status. One document discusses baseline fetal heart rate characteristics as an indicator of fetal status during the antepartum period. This suggests that NST may be used to monitor fetal well-being. As there is no specific information about NST intervals in these documents, we should focus on general guidelines for monitoring high-risk pregnancies.\n\nThe most relevant information comes from the document discussing gestational diabetes, which mentions the importance of monitoring high-risk pregnancies for potential complications. While this does not provide a specific time frame for NST monitoring, it suggests that more frequent monitoring is necessary to detect any issues early.\n\nComparing these documents with general guidelines and recommendations for non-stress test (NST) monitoring in high-risk pregnancies, we can infer that the ideal time for NST monitoring would be 24-48 hours.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
