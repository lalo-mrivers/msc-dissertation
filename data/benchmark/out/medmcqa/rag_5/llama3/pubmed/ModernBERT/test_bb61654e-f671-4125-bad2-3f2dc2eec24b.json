["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the function of 2% potassium sulphate in a gypsum product. The provided documents are related to various analytical methods, synthesis, and properties of materials, but none of them directly address the function of potassium sulphate in a gypsum product. Therefore, we need to look for general information about potassium sulphate or gypsum products to answer this question. In dental amalgams, potassium sulfate is known to regulate setting expansion (Source: Amalgam containing nickel or tungsten dispersions. II). Similarly, in gypsum products, potassium sulfate can be used to regulate setting expansion. Hence, we can infer that the function of 2% potassium sulphate in a gypsum product is to regulate setting expansion.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
