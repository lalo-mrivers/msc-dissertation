["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Since the question is about LA blockade, I need to focus on the documents that discuss nerve fibres. The key document for this question would be 'A key to the classification of cutaneous mechanoreceptors.' This document provides a classification scheme for cutaneous mechanoreceptors in cats, including 11 groups based on physiologic tests performed with hand-held stimulators. However, it does not specifically mention LA blockade or its effects on different types of nerve fibres. The other documents do not seem to be relevant to this question.\n\nBased on my knowledge of local anesthetics (LAs) and their effects on nerve fibres, I would expect that the least susceptible type of fibre to LA blockade is C-fibres. This is because C-fibres are primarily responsible for transmitting non-myelinated, thinly myelinated or unmyelinated nerve impulses, which are less affected by LAs compared to thicker myelinated A-beta and A-alpha fibres.\n\nTherefore, considering these factors and the available information, I would conclude that the correct answer is D: C fibers.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
