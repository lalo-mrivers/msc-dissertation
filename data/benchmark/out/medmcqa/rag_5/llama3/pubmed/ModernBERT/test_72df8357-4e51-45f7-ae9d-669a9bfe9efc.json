["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Since none of the provided documents mention lidocaine or antiarrhythmic effects, we need to consider the medications mentioned: succinyldicholine, theophylline, phenobarbital, diphenylhydantoin. Succinyldicholine has a convulsant action and anticonvulsant drugs were used in combination with marihuana smoking. Theophylline derivatives have sedative properties. None of these medications are related to cardiac arrhythmia or lidocaine. The molluscicide Frescon interferes with inhibitory processes, but this is not relevant to the question. Delphinium brownii's toxin methyllycaconitine is a neuromuscular blocking agent, not an antiarrhythmic one. Therefore, we can't find any connection between lidocaine and its antiarrhythmic effects in these documents.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
