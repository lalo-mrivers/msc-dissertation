["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe various medical procedures and solutions. Hypothermic prostatic resection uses a cooled irrigant solution to reduce blood loss. This suggests that cooling or hypothermia is used in this context. The question asks about the use of hypertonic solution, which is not explicitly mentioned as being used in any of the described procedures. However, one document discusses cryo-solutions for thermodilution methods, which also involves cooling. Therefore, it can be inferred that cooling or hypothermia is more relevant to the context than hypertonic solutions.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
