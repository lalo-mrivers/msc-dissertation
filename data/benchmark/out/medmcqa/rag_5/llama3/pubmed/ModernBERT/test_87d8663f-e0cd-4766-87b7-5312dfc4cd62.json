["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the type of failure that may occur when the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) of a ceramic is much lower than that of a metal. The key point to consider is the difference in CTE between the two materials, which can cause thermal stress and ultimately lead to failure. Since the ceramic has a lower CTE than the metal, it will tend to contract more when cooled, while the metal will expand less. This mismatch can result in compressive stresses on the ceramic and tensile stresses on the metal.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
