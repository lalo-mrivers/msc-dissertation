["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks for the predicted height of a person based on the length of their humerus. According to the document [Uncovered bones on the Baltic Sea beach--human or animal?], the average length of a human humerus is about 29 cm. Using this information, we can find the ratio of the observed length (24.5 cm) to the normal length (29 cm). This ratio is approximately 0.84. If we multiply this ratio by the normal height, we get an estimated height. According to other sources, the average human height is around 170 cm. Multiplying 0.84 by 170 gives us approximately 143 cm. However, since the humerus length of 24.5 cm was found in a person whose entire body was not intact, it's possible that the actual height might be slightly different.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
