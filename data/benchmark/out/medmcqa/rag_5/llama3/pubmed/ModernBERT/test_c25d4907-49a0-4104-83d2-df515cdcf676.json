["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 35-year-old lactating mother presenting with a painful breast lump. This suggests that the lump may be related to lactation or breastfeeding, which makes mammography less likely as an initial investigation option. USG (ultrasound) is a more suitable choice as it can help visualize the internal structures of the breast and detect any abnormalities such as a abscess or a benign/malignant tumor. MRI is not necessary at this stage as it may provide too much information that may not be relevant to the patient's current condition. X-ray is also not an appropriate initial investigation option as it primarily used for bone and lung imaging, not breast imaging. Therefore, USG is the most appropriate initial investigation choice.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
