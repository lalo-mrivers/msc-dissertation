["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient underwent transsphenoidal hypophysectomy for a pituitary mass. This procedure typically removes the pituitary gland or parts of it, which can affect various hormone production. L-Thyroxine is produced by the thyroid gland and not directly related to the pituitary gland. Estradiol is an estrogen hormone also not primarily produced by the pituitary gland. Glucocoicoids are cortisol hormones produced by the adrenal cortex, but the pituitary gland regulates their production via ACTH. Mineralocoicoids are aldosterone hormones also produced by the adrenal cortex and regulated by the pituitary gland via ACTH. Therefore, considering the surgical procedure and hormonal regulation, post-op replacement of Glucocoicoids is not needed.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"]
