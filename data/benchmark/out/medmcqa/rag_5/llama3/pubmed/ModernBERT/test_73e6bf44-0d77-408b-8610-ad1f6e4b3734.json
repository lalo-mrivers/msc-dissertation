["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Given the patient is a 6-year-old child with fever 5 days ago which is now afebrile, normal muscle mass, tone, and reflex, no neurological deficit but pain on palpating muscles and CPK levels 2000. The key points to consider are the age of onset, presence of pain on palpation, and elevated CPK levels. Eales's disease can present with low thoracic level paraplegia over 2 months, which is not relevant here as the patient is afebrile now. McArdle's disease typically presents in adulthood and does not fit this case either. Hoffman's syndrome may cause high muscular enzymes but no histological or ultrastructural muscle alterations were detected, which doesn't match our patient's situation. Temporal arteritis usually occurs in older adults and has different symptoms than what we see here. Sarcoidosis can present with skin involvement and joint pain, but this is not described in the case. Dermatomyositis often presents with proximal muscle weakness, skin changes, and elevated CPK levels, which aligns with our patient's situation.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
