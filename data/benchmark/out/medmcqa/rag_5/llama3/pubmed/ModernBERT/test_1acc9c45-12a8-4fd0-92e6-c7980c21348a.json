["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant document for this question is [Temperature-dependence of biological process (author's transl)]. The parameter used to determine the sensitivity of vaccine due to heat is related to temperature dependence. Therefore, we need to find a parameter that involves temperature. Upon reviewing the document, we can see that it talks about the modified Arrhenius equation and a temperature-variable coefficient. This suggests that the parameter may be related to the way biological processes change with temperature. After considering the available options, I think the correct answer is C: VCM.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"]
