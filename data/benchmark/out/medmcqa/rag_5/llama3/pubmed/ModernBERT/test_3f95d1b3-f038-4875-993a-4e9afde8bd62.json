["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about codons, specifically the codon for selenocysteine. None of the provided documents relate to genetics or molecular biology, so I must rely on my general knowledge and consider the possibility that selenocysteine might be a amino acid. After reviewing the standard genetic code, I found that UGA is the codon for the amino acid cysteine, which is similar to selenocysteine. Additionally, some sources suggest that UAG can also be a stop codon or an ambiguous codon, but it is not typically associated with selenocysteine.\", \"answer_choice\": B}"]
