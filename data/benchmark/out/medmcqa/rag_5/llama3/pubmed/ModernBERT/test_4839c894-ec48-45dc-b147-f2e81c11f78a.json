["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the lateral lingual swellings and tuberculum impar. Looking at the provided documents, there are no explicit mentions of these terms. However, one document discusses the anatomy of the mandibular joint (articulus mandibulae), but it does not mention the tongue or its lingual swellings. The other documents discuss various topics such as lymphatic system, subtalar dislocation, and parotid gland carcinomas, but none of them relate to the lateral lingual swellings and tuberculum impar. Therefore, we need to look for general knowledge about the anatomy of the tongue. According to anatomical texts, the lateral lingual swellings refer to the fungiform papillae, which are found on the anterior 2/3 of the tongue. The tuberculum impar is a small elevation located at the midline of the tongue. Therefore, based on general knowledge and absence of relevant information in the provided documents, we can conclude that the lateral lingual swellings and tuberculum impar give rise to the anterior 2/3 of the tongue.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
