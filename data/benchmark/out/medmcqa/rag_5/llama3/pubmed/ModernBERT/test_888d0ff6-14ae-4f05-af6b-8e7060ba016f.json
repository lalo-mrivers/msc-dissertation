["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about a hormone controlled by feedforward control. We need to look for information related to control algorithms or methods in the provided documents. The document 'Control algorithms for artificial beta cell' describes the evolution of control algorithms for closed-loop regulation of blood glucose levels, including the use of derivative algorithms. This suggests that insulin is controlled using feedback and prediction-based control algorithms rather than feedforward control. Therefore, we can rule out options A (ADH), B (Insulin), C (Corticosteroids), and D (Prolactin).\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
