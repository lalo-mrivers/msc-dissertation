["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about what is used to decrease uterine contractility during preterm labour. The relevant documents seem to be focused on obstetric procedures such as tubal microsurgery, ultrasonic studies in obstetrics, delivery of twin pregnancies, and uterine surgical approaches to reduce prematurity. However, the document on 'The use of drains in subcutaneous surgical procedures' does not provide any information related to preterm labour or decreasing uterine contractility. Therefore, I will focus on the documents that are relevant to obstetrics.\n\nFrom the 'Value of ultrasonic studies in obstetrics' document, it seems that ultrasonics A-Scan devices are used to improve perinatal mortality and morbidity. However, this does not provide any information about decreasing uterine contractility during preterm labour.\n\nThe 'Delivery of twin pregnancy' document discusses labor induction or Cesarian section without mentioning anything about decreasing uterine contractility.\n\nThe 'Uterine surgical approaches to reduce prematurity' document suggests that a careful investigation should be conducted prior to surgical intervention, but it does not provide any information about decreasing uterine contractility.\n\nThe only relevant document seems to be 'Tubal microsurgery--a review'. This document discusses microsurgery being applied with considerable advantage to tubal reconstruction and improving pregnancy rates. However, it does not mention anything about preterm labour or decreasing uterine contractility.\n\nBased on the information provided in these documents, none of them seem to be related to decreasing uterine contractility during preterm labour. Therefore, I will focus on the options provided:\n\nA: Methyl alcohol\nB: Ritodrine\nC: Magnesium sulphate\nD: Dexamethasone\n\nRitodrine is a medication that is used to decrease uterine contractility during preterm labour. It seems that this option B is the most relevant one.\n\nSince none of the provided documents discuss decreasing uterine contractility, I will assume that Ritodrine is not mentioned in any of these documents because it is not used for such a purpose.\n\nTherefore, I conclude that Ritodrine (option B) is the correct answer.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
