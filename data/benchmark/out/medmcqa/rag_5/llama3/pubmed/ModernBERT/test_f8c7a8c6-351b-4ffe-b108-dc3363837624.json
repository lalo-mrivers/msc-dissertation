["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Since the method is new, it's necessary to assess its performance. We have 10 successive readings of a single sample with varying values. However, we also know the true value of Haemoglobin measured by standard calorimetry, which is 10.2. This allows us to evaluate the accuracy and reliability of the new method. The values from the new method vary significantly, but they are mostly around the true value. This suggests that the method has some degree of validity.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C: High validity, high reliability\"\n}"]
