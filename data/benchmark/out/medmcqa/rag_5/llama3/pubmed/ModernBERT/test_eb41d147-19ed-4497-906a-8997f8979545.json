["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the origin of the three embryonic germ layers: ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm. The provided documents mention the formation of chick embryos, rat embryonic ectoderm, and human fetuses. We can infer that the embryo is formed from two layers: epiblast and hypoblast. Epiblast gives rise to ectoderm and mesoderm, while hypoblast gives rise to endoderm. Therefore, we can conclude that the 3 embryonic germ layers are derived from both epiblast (ectoderm and mesoderm) and hypoblast (endoderm).\", \"answer_choice\": C}"]
