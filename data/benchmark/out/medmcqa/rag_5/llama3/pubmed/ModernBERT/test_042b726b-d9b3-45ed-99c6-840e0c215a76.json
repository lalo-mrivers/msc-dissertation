["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the site of lesion in endocarditis of RHD. The relevant documents provided are case reports on various conditions, but none of them specifically discuss endocarditis or RHD. However, we can look for any information related to heart valves or lesions that may provide a hint. Upon reviewing the documents, I found the 'Ventricular obstruction due to ectasia of the internal carotid artery' report, which mentions the foramen of Monro. This is not directly related to endocarditis or RHD, but it does mention a valve-like structure (the foramen of Monro). This information suggests that lesions in endocarditis of RHD may occur along lines similar to those mentioned in this document.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
