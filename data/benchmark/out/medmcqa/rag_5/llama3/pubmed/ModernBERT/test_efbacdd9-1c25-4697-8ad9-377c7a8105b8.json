["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about Boiled Lobster Syndrome, which is not a real medical condition. However, Lewisite is mentioned in one of the documents as a substance that causes scarring. Trapshooter's stigma is also mentioned, but it does not seem related to the syndrome. The other documents do not mention anything relevant to the question. After reviewing all the options, Boric acid seems unlikely due to the presence of sulfur and nitrogen compounds in Lewisite. Phenol is also ruled out as it is not typically associated with scarring like Lewisite. HNO3 (nitric acid) is a possible match as it can cause severe burns and scarring.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
