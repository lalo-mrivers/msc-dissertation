["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about calcification of roots of deciduous teeth. Since the provided documents are mostly related to dentistry and orthopedics, I'll focus on finding relevant information from the 'Simplified Class V matrix for resin restorations' document which seems to be the most closely related to tooth-related issues. Within this document, there is no specific mention of calcification of roots of deciduous teeth. However, since deciduous teeth are typically shed and replaced by permanent teeth within a certain timeframe, I can infer that calcification might not be completed after 2 years (A) as deciduous teeth usually start falling out around the age of 6. The other options seem less plausible given this context.\", \"answer_choice\": A}"]
