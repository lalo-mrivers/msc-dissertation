["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe film/screen combinations for X-ray imaging. In 'Technical note. Evaluation of a new screen/film combination', it is mentioned that the Trimax system offers film/screen combinations which reduce the X-ray exposure by factors of about 4. This is achieved without deterioration in image quality. It doesn't mention anything about the base composition of an X-ray film, but we can infer that the base must be something that interacts with the screen to achieve this effect. The other documents describe various devices and systems for X-ray imaging, but none of them provide information on the composition of the X-ray film itself.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
