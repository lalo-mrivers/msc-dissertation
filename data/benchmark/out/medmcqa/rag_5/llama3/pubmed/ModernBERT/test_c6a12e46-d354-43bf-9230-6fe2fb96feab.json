["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe various topics such as somatosensory evoked responses, hypersensitive reactions, botulinum toxin therapy, postinjection trismus, and a method for controlling small vessels. The question is about the rapid onset of action seen by local anesthesia in small nerve endings. This suggests that the mechanism being discussed is related to the anesthetic properties of local anesthetics on nerve fibers. The documents do not specifically discuss this topic, but they provide information about different types of nerve fibers and their responses to various stimuli. Based on this information, it can be inferred that the rapid onset of action seen by local anesthesia in small nerve endings is due to the high ratio of surface area to volume of these fibres.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
