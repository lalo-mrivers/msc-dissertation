["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about a 7-year-old child with deep carious lesions in multiple teeth but without pain. The first thing to consider is that the child is asymptomatic despite having significant tooth decay. This suggests that the infection may not have reached the pulp, and therefore, the pulp may still be intact. Pulpotomy would require removing some of the infected pulp tissue, which may not be necessary in this case. Indirect pulp capping might be considered to prevent further bacterial invasion, but it's unlikely to address the extent of the decay. RCT (root canal treatment) is typically performed on teeth that are non-restorable or have a significant risk of abscess formation. Extraction could be an option if the teeth are severely damaged or if the child has no other options for replacing the teeth. However, considering the child's age and the fact that they're asymptomatic, RCT might be the most conservative approach to preserve as many teeth as possible.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"]
