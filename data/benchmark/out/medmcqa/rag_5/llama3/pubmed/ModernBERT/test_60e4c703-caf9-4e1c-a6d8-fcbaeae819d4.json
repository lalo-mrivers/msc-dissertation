["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the correct answer, we need to understand how skeletal muscles contract. The question mentions that contraction is initiated by calcium binding to a specific protein. This suggests that we should look for a mechanism involving calcium ions and muscle proteins. Upon reviewing the relevant literature, we find that contraction of skeletal muscles is initiated by calcium binding to troponin (C). Therefore, option C is the correct answer.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"]
