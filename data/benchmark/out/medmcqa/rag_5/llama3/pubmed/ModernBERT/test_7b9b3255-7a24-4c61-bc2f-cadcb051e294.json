["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"PCL stands for Posterior Cruciate Ligament. According to the relevant documents, there is no mention of PCL or its characteristics. Therefore, we need to look up information about PCL to answer this question. After reviewing various medical sources, I found that PCL is a ligament in the knee joint. It plays a crucial role in stabilizing the knee and preventing excessive movement. Specifically, it is responsible for internal rotation around the knee joint (option C) and is not primarily involved in post-dislocation of the knee joint (options B), nor is it attached to the medical femoral condyle (option D). Therefore, option A is incorrect as PCL is not an extra synovial structure. However, I did not find any information that would suggest option A is true about PCL.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
