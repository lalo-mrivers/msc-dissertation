["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Pelvimetry is a procedure that involves measuring the pelvis. In this procedure, the author describes a simple and precise technique for pelvimetry that delivers only a low dose of irradiation. This technique includes the usual lateral view, but for the AP (anterior posterior) view, it uses Fernstroem's method. Frankfort-horizonal plane is used in pelvimetry as a reference plane. The Frankfort-horizonal plane is constructed by joining the porion and orbitale landmarks.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
