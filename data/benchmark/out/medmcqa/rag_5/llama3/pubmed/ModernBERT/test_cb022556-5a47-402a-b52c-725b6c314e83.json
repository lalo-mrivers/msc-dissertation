["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the metabolite of sodium nitroprusside. The relevant document is 'Metabolism of n-nitrosopiperidine by a purified microsomal preparation from rat liver was shown to yield 5-hydroxypentanal.' This suggests that alpha-hydroxylation is involved in the metabolism of nitroso compounds. In another document, it says that guanylate cyclase may have important roles in the metabolism of exogeneous drugs. Given these hints, we can deduce that the active metabolite of sodium nitroprusside would likely involve an increase in cGMP levels, which is achieved through activation of guanylate cyclase.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
