["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 34-year-old primigravida at 11 weeks gestation with exposure to a rash. The husband is HIV+ve and has broken out on a rash in his left buttock, which consists of grouped vesicles on a maculopapular base, 4 days back. The patient's HIV testing is negative. She presents with fever, rash, and abnormal physical findings (P/R: 86/min, B/P: 100/60 mmHg, resp rate: 10/min). Since the patient is pregnant, the priority should be on maternal and fetal safety.

However, given the risk of transmission to the fetus, it is crucial to consider measures to reduce this risk.\", \n\"answer_choice\": C"]
