["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Tramadol is an analgesic drug that acts similarly to opioids. We can look at the mechanisms of action of other analgesics mentioned in the provided documents. Nefopam, for example, inhibits imipramine binding, suggesting a possible intervention of serotonergic mechanisms. Tramadol's additional mechanism of action is different from this, as it doesn't inhibit serotonin release. Instead, we can look at beta-endorphin's activity. Beta-endorphin has potent behavioral and antinociceptive activities when administered intraventricularly in cats. Its actions are blocked by naloxone. Tramadol might be acting similarly to stimulate mu opioid receptors, but its additional mechanism of action is likely related to nor-adrenaline reuptake inhibition.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
