["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the response of alveolar bone to traumatic occlusal forces. The relevant documents don't seem to directly address this topic, but we can try to apply general principles from cranio-facial injuries and post-traumatic lesions of the bones of the cranio-facial mass. From these papers, it seems that in response to trauma or stress, bones undergo changes involving osteoblasts and osteoclasts. Osteoblasts are responsible for bone formation and osteoclasts for resorption. Areas of tension might lead to increased osteoblastic activity, while areas of pressure might lead to increased osteoclastic activity.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
