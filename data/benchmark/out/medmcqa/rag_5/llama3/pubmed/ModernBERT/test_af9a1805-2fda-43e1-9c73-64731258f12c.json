["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, we need to find the mean systolic blood pressure. Since it's given as 125 mmHg with a standard deviation of 10, we can calculate the z-score for the lower bound (95th percentile). The z-score will be -1.645 (using the standard normal distribution table or calculator), which corresponds to a value below 125 mmHg. To find the actual value, we'll subtract the z-score from the mean: 125 - 10 * 1.645 = 105.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
