["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"After reviewing the provided documents, I did not find any information that directly relates to single accessory canals arising from the coronal third of mandibular molars. However, I found a document about planimetry of negative replicas on the mandibular joints and another about angular invariants in developing human mandibles. These documents do not provide information about accessory canals. The remaining documents are about fusions of primary teeth and tentorial arteries arising from the external carotid artery, which also do not relate to single accessory canals. Therefore, I will focus on the absence of relevant information.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
