["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about a patient with a swelling over the left angle of the mandible, fever, and no history of trauma. This suggests an inflammatory process rather than a traumatic event or a developmental anomaly. Mumps can cause swelling in the face and fever, so it's a possible option.

Pericoronal infection seems to be a reasonable possibility as it can cause swelling and fever.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
