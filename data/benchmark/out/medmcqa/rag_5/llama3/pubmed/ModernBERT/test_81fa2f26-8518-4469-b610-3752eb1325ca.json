["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the property of cobalt chromium crown reconstruction during soldering. The temperature of the soldering torch increases suddenly. This makes me think of the properties of materials that change with temperature. I can rule out options A and B because yield strength typically decreases when temperature increases, not increases. Option C seems more plausible as yield strength often increases with increasing temperature. Percent elongation might decrease due to increased hardness at higher temperatures.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
