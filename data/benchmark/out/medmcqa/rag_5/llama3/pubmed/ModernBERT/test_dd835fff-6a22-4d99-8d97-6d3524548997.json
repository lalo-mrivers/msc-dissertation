["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents mention the strength and hardness of dental stone being affected by porosity rather than water-powder ratio. Since the question is about the hardness of stone surface, I will focus on the document [Effect of porosity on strength and hardness of dental stone (author's transl)]. The text states that 'Within the range of porosity of less than 34 vol-%, the strength and hardness varied logarithmically with a linear change in porosity.' This suggests that porosity has a significant impact on the hardness of stone surface.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
