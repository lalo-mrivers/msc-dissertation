["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks for the term of a radio opaque area found at the root apex of young permanent teeth involved with chronic pulpitis. After reviewing the provided documents, I did not find any information about odontomas, lipoma, choristoma or reconstruction of lower fornix related to the root apex or chronic pulpitis. However, in 'Tongue ulcerated by trauma: report of case', a patient had a traumatic ulcer on the lateral border of the tongue. This is not directly related to the question but it does mention pulpitis which suggests that there may be some connection between pulpitis and apical lesions. In 'Choristoma osseum orbitae', I found a description of a congenital bone formation in the orbit, but this is also not directly related to the root apex or chronic pulpitis. Finally, in '[An interesting case]', I did not find any information about the term for a radio opaque area at the root apex of young permanent teeth involved with chronic pulpitis. Given that these documents do not provide direct information on the topic, I will look for the answer among the provided options.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
