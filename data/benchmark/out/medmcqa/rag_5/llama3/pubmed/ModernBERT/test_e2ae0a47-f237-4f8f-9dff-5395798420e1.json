["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Since the question is about scaphoid fracture at waist with retrograde blood supply, we need to understand the anatomy of the scaphoid bone. The scaphoid has three parts: proximal, middle and distal. The waist refers to the junction between the proximal and middle parts. This area is also known as the isthmus. With retrograde blood supply, it means that the blood flow to this area is compromised. Considering these factors, we can deduce that the segment most susceptible to avascular necrosis is likely to be the middle part of the scaphoid bone.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
