["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about maintaining parallelism between an object and film to avoid distortion. The provided documents are related to photography and film processing, but none of them specifically discuss the distance between an object and film. However, one document mentions taking Chamber-angle photos with a Zeiss Fundus Camera, which requires a specific device to hold the camera. This suggests that maintaining parallelism is important in this context. Therefore, it can be inferred that increasing or decreasing the target-to-object distance may affect the parallelism.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
