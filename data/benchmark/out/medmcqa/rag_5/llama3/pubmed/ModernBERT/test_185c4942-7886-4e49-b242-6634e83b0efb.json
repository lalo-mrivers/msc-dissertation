["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Post-translational modification refers to the addition of a functional group or molecule to an amino acid residue after translation. The question is asking which of the given options does not undergo post-translational modification.\\nConsidering the provided documents, N-glycosylation and lipid precursor pool size are mentioned, but no information about selenocysteine, triiodothyronine, hydroxyproline, or hydroxylysine.\\nThe only information available is from [N-terminal sequence of a parvalbumin of rabbit muscle], which does not mention these amino acids.\\nTherefore, the focus should be on the given amino acid options. Selenocysteine and triiodothyronine are not amino acids, they are seleno-amino acid and thyroid hormone respectively, which do not undergo post-translational modification.\\nHydroxyproline is a modified form of proline, while hydroxylysine is a modified form of lysine. Both are the result of post-translational modification.\\nIn conclusion, only Selenocysteine and Triiodothyronine do not include post-translational modification.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
