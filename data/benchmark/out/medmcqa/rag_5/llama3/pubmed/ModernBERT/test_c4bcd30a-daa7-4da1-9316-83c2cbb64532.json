["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the contractile element in a skeletal muscle. The provided documents mention proteins in chain-like form (chain-proteins of the vertebrate lens) and mathematical models of retinal cells, but none of these are directly related to skeletal muscles. The document on 'A functional model of the human cardiac ventricle' is more relevant as it talks about a quantitative model that accurately reproduces the time activity curve of the human left ventricular blood pool. This suggests that there may be similarities in the contractile elements between cardiac and skeletal muscles.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
