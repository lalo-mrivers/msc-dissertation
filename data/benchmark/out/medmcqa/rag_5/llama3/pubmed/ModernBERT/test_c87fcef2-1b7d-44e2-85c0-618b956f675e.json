["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"DIC stands for Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation. DIC is a condition characterized by the formation of blood clots in small blood vessels throughout the body. In DIC, there is an excessive production of thromboplastin (also known as factor IX) which can lead to the formation of fibrin clots. This results in a prolonged PT and APTT. Therefore, options C and D are incorrect. Fibrinogen is typically elevated in DIC, not decreased. Thrombocytopenia (low platelet count) is often seen in DIC due to the destruction of platelets by the coagulation process.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A: Fibrinogen decreased\""]
