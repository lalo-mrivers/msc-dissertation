["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents provide information on different medical conditions. Among the provided options, we can find that Rheumatic heart disease is discussed in 'The pediatric arthritides' document as one of the possible outcomes of juvenile rheumatoid arthritis. This document does not specify major criteria for Rheumatic heart disease, but it does mention that 'Carditis' and 'Arthritis' are two principal syndromes of juvenile rheumatoid arthritis. Therefore, we can deduce that 'Arthritis' is a characteristic feature of juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, which is also one of the possible causes of Rheumatic heart disease. Similarly, 'Carditis' is also mentioned as one of the possible outcomes of juvenile rheumatoid arthritis. This information suggests that both 'Arthritis' and 'Carditis' are related to Rheumatic heart disease, but only 'Carditis' is a major criteria for Rheumatic heart disease. Therefore, we can conclude that 'Arthritis' is NOT a major criteria for Rheumatic heart disease.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
