["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents provided do not mention the midface or its definition. Therefore, I will rely on general knowledge of anatomy. The midface is a portion of the face that lies between the orbit and the oral cavity. It includes bones such as the maxilla, zygoma, and nasal bones. Based on this information, I can eliminate options C and D as they refer to distances measured from the glabella (forehead) or menton (chin), respectively. Option B is also incorrect as it only refers to a distance between two points on the face. Therefore, option A, which describes the portion of the face between the hairline and subnasale, is the most likely definition of midface.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
