["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the inter radicular bone. None of the provided documents mention this specific term or provide direct information about it. However, I can infer that the inter radicular bone refers to the cancellous bone found between the vertebrae's holes (intervertebral foramina). The documents do not specifically discuss vertebral bones, but they do describe different types of fractures and injuries.

Based on this information, I will choose an answer.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
