["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Upon reviewing the provided documents, I did not find any direct information related to cephalometric analysis or growth changes. However, this question seems to be specific to orthodontics or dentistry. After analyzing the relevant documents, I found that none of them discuss superimposing cephalometric analysis on a specific plane. Therefore, I will rely on my knowledge of cephalometrics and general understanding of the field. Cephalometric analysis typically involves superimposing the tracing on the Sella-Nasion (S-N) plane, which is a reference point in the skull. This plane provides a stable landmark for evaluating growth changes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
