["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about excessive occlusal forces. Supra-condylar fractures in children by the method of percutaneous nailing are mentioned in the first document, but it does not provide information related to occlusal forces or intraoral procedures. The second document discusses human anthrax and its permanence in a specific area, which is unrelated to the topic. The third document reports on intraoral third molar transplants, but it focuses on tooth transplantation rather than occlusal forces. The fourth document describes a retention suture technique using buttons for securing heavy sutures. The last document discusses long trips of intra-uterine devices in tropical areas and their migration mechanisms. None of these documents provide information about excessive occlusal forces or the conditions mentioned in the options. Therefore, we must look at the specific context of each option to determine which one does not apply to excessive occlusal forces.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
