["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"There is no information provided about Bennett's movement or lateral shift that would directly relate to the position of teeth. The relevant documents appear to be unrelated to dentistry or oral health. Based on this, I will eliminate options A and B as they are both related to tooth position. Option C mentions both faciolingual and mesiodistal positions of teeth, which further supports my conclusion that these terms are not relevant to the provided information. Therefore, I am left with option D, None of the above.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
