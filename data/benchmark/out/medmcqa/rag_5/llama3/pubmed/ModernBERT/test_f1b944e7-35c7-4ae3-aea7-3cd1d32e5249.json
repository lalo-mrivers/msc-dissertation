["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"After reviewing the provided documents, it can be inferred that granulation tissue is mentioned in the first document. The development of granulation tissue is described without mentioning any specific type of collagen. However, in the 'Amyloid P component--a special type of collagen?' document, amyloid P-components are discussed in relation to collagen and amyloidosis. This suggests that different types of collagen may be present in various tissues. In the context of healing and granulation tissue, it is likely that Type III collagen is involved due to its presence in healing and granulation tissue as described in 'Amyloid P component--a special type of collagen?'.\n\nTherefore, the answer choice is C: Type III.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"]
