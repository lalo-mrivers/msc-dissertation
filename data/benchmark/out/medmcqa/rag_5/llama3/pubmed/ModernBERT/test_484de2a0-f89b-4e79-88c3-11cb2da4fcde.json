["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to the provided documents, we know that the distribution of intra-ocular pressure (IOP) is normally distributed. In the [Results of a glaucoma mass screening program (author's transl)] document, it is mentioned that the frequencies of various pressure values were in accordance with a Gaussian distribution up to 21 mm Hg. Therefore, we can apply the z-score method to find the lower limit of the average IOP that can be expected 95% of times.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the mean and standard deviation (SD) from the given information: Average = 30 mm, SD = 1.0. This is the same as in the question.\n\nNext, we need to find the z-score corresponding to a confidence interval of 95%. The z-score for a 95% CI is approximately 1.96 (from a standard normal distribution table).\n\nThen, we subtract the z-score from the mean to get the lower limit: Mean - Z-Score = 30 - 1.96 = 28.\n\nThis value represents the average IOP that can be expected 95% of times.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
