["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"No documents mention enzymes that play a role in calcification. However, one document discusses enzymic reduction of nitrite in various pathways, but it does not specifically mention calcification. Another document talks about hormones and tissues growth factors in milk during lactation, which is unrelated to calcification. Therefore, we need to look at the documents more closely for any information on enzymes involved in calcification.\\r\\n\\r\\nUpon reviewing the documents again, we find that one document describes various molecular characteristics of enzymes employed in denitrifying, assimilatory and dissimilatory pathways. Although this document does not directly mention enzymes involved in calcification, it does describe several types of enzymes. Among these are alkaline phosphatase and pyrophosphatase.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn conclusion, based on the information provided in the documents, we can infer that enzymes such as alkaline phosphatase and pyrophosphatase may play a role in calcification.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
