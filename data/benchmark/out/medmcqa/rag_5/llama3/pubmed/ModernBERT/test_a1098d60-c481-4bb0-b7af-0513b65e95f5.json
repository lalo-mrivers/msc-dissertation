["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The provided documents describe various aspects of human anatomy and physiology, including the heart. The 'A functional model of the human cardiac ventricle' document presents a quantitative model that accurately reproduces the time activity curve of the human left ventricular blood pool. This suggests that the document provides information on the functioning of the heart ventricles. Among the available choices (A: S1, B: S2, C: S3, D: S4), only one indicates stiffness of the ventricular wall. Therefore, I will focus on identifying which sound corresponds to stiffness.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
