["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"After reviewing the provided documents, I found that multiple myeloma is a type of cancer that affects plasma cells. One of the characteristic features of multiple myeloma is an abnormal protein spike on electrophoresis, known as M spike. This is caused by the production of immunoglobulin (Ig) proteins in excess.\n\nIncreased Ig levels in serum are actually a feature of multiple myeloma, not a characteristic that is not present. Positive ANA (antinuclear antibody) tests can be seen in various autoimmune disorders and are not specific to multiple myeloma. Plasmacytosis refers to an increase in the number of plasma cells, which is a hallmark of multiple myeloma.\n\nTherefore, I conclude that the correct answer choice is B: Positive ANA.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
