["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks which hormone crosses the plasma membrane for its action. The provided documents do not mention retinoic acid, neuraminidase, or any of the above hormones in relation to crossing a plasma membrane. However, Mitogenic action of neuraminidase discusses the mitogenic effect of neuraminidase on lymphocytes, but it does not describe the hormone crossing the plasma membrane. Active control of intracellular pH is unrelated to the question. Measurement of an inhibitory zone describes a phenomenon in Anabaena and does not mention hormones or plasma membranes. Action potentials in non-tumor cells from the anterior pituitary gland discusses electrical stimulation-induced action potentials, but it does not provide information about hormone crossing the plasma membrane.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"]
