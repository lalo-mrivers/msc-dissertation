["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe various anaesthesia-related topics, but none of them mention glycopyrrolate. However, we can look for related information on the purpose of giving atropine or similar agents before anaesthesia. Atropine is an anticholinergic drug that can be used to reduce secretions during surgery. The relevant document 'Anaesthetic induction and maintenance with flunitrazepam' does not mention glycopyrrolate, but it does discuss halothane requirement reduction with flunitrazepam. Another document 'Rectal methohexitone for induction of anaesthesia in children' mentions the importance of observing the child until they fall asleep after rectal induction. None of these documents provide information on glycopyrrolate's role before anaesthesia, but we can look at its pharmacological effects to infer its purpose.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B\n}"]
