["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"After reviewing the provided documents, I didn't find any information about fluoride used in iontophoresis. However, one of the documents describes a method for determining fluoride in vegetation, but it's not related to its use in iontophoresis.\\r\\nI also noticed that none of the documents mention the percentage of fluoride used in thermodilution, membrane oxygenator, or hydrazones. Therefore, I will focus on the document about radiothermoluminescent dosimetry in plesioroentgenotherapy.\\r\\nIn this document, lithium fluoride microdosimeters are mentioned as a means to evaluate X-rays emitted by a plesiotherapy apparatus. This suggests that fluoride might be involved in this process, but I couldn't find any information about its percentage used in iontophoresis.\\r\\nGiven the lack of information about fluoride in iontophoresis, I will base my answer on my general knowledge and experience with medical procedures.\\r\\nThe amount of fluoride used in iontophoresis is usually not a significant percentage of the total solution.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
