["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"No relevant information about ganglionic transmission is provided in the given documents. However, we can analyze the structure of neurons to understand ganglionic transmission. Ganglion cells receive inputs from presynaptic terminals and transmit signals to postsynaptic cells. Presynaptic alpha-receptors regulate the release of neurotransmitters from the terminal. Postsynaptic nicotinic receptors are responsible for transmitting the signal across the synapse.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
