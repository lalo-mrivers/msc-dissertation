["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the apical migration of the epithelial attachment. This type of migration would result in recession of the marginal gingiva. The relevant documents provided are about different topics such as intra-corneal sutures, intra-osseous vascularization, apical growth of Hydra buds, and interdental papilla pedicle grafts. However, one document that catches my attention is [About the face value of the cleft of the articulus mandibulae], which discusses the relationships between squamal discoidal and mandibular faces.
