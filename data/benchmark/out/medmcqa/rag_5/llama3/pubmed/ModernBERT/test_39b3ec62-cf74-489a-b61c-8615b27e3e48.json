["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided articles, occupational medicine is not mentioned as a behavioral theory. The article 'A bird's eye view of occupational medicine' discusses the training involved and phases of occupational medicine, but does not mention behavior theories. Similarly, the other articles do not provide any information related to behavioral theories. Therefore, I will focus on the given options. Cognitive theory, Hierarchy of needs, Social learning are all behavioral theories. Classical conditioning is also a behavioral theory. Since the question asks which option is NOT a behavioral theory, I will exclude behavioral theories from the options and choose the one that does not fit this category.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
