["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about a 10-year-old boy with a contaminated wound on the left leg following a road traffic accident. He has received complete primary immunization before preschool age and a booster of DT at school entry age. The options are injection of TT, human antiserum, broad-spectrum antibiotics, and wound debridement and cleaning.\n\nFirstly, the child's vaccination history is important to consider. Since he has received complete primary immunization and a booster of DT, this suggests that he is partially protected against tetanus.\n\nNext, the wound is contaminated, which means it may be infected with bacteria. Broad-spectrum antibiotics could be used to treat any potential infection.\n\nHowever, there are some concerns about giving TT (tetanus toxoid) injection in this situation. While the child has received a booster of DT, this does not guarantee that he is fully protected against tetanus. However, injecting TT without proper wound care and cleaning may not be the best approach.\n\nHuman antiserum is not typically used to treat wounds, so this option can be ruled out.\n\nWound debridement and cleaning are essential steps in treating a contaminated wound like this one.\n\nTherefore, injection of TT is the most likely correct answer.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
