["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about a low insulin to glucagon ratio. The provided documents describe the effects of different diets on glucose and insulin levels. In particular, the document 'High-carbohydrate, low-fat diet? Negative' states that carbohydrate intake raises blood glucose levels and insulin requirements. This suggests that insulin levels increase in response to high carbohydrate intake. This is consistent with glycogen synthesis (A) which requires insulin stimulation. The other options do not directly relate to insulin-glucagon ratio.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
