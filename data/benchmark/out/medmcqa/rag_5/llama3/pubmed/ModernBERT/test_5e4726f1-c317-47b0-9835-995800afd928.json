["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the composition of early plaque in heavy calculus formers. Since the provided documents are mostly related to different topics such as contact lenses, dental wound dressings, radiisotope tests, microstructure of urinary tract stones, and radionuclide imaging, none of these directly address the question. However, one document [Microstructure of the Urinary Tract Stone Formations] does mention stone formations, which is relevant to calculus formers. Upon reviewing this document, it can be inferred that early plaque in heavy calculus formers likely consists of calcium and phosphorus, given the presence of Ca and PO4 in the composition.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C: Phosphorous > calcium > potassium\"\n}"]
