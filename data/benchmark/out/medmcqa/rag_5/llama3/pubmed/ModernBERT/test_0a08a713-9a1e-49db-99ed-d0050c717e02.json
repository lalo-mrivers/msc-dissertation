["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the tooth that typically has greater crown bulk distal to the faciolingual dissecting plane. The faciolingual dissecting plane is a reference point for the dental cleft of the articulus mandibulae, which is related to the squamal discoidal and mandibular faces as described in the first document. This suggests that the question is related to the anatomy of the jaw. The description of dilaceration of a primary tooth does not seem relevant, nor do the procedures for suction or repair of the upper lip and nostril floor. Therefore, it seems likely that the answer refers to a mandibular tooth. Among the options, the second premolar is more typical of having greater crown bulk distal to the faciolingual dissecting plane compared to central incisors, canines, or lateral incisors.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
