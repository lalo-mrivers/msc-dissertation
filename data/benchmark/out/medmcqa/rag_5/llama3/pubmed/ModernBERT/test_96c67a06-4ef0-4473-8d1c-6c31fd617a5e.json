["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking which option will NOT lead to the spread of communicable disease during a disaster. We can analyze each option separately: A) Diarrhoea - This could potentially lead to the spread of enteric diseases, as mentioned in 'A perspective on the global problem of enteric diseases'. B) Acute Respiratory infection - This is a common condition that can be exacerbated by disaster-related factors such as poor sanitation and overcrowding.
