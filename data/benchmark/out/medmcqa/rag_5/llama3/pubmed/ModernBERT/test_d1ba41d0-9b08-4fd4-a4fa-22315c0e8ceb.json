["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about myelinated nerve fibers. The first document discusses the ultrastructure of skeletal muscle fibers in hypokinetic rats, which is not relevant to this question. The second and third documents discuss Pacinian neurofibroma and partial deletion of the short arm of chromosome 4, respectively, neither of which provides information about myelinated nerve fibers. The fourth document discusses skin equivalents, also unrelated to myelinated nerve fibers. Therefore, I must rely on general knowledge of anatomy and physiology. Myelinated nerve fibers are a type of nerve fiber that uses the process of saltation conduction, where depolarization occurs at nodes of Ranvier. This is different from non-myelinated fibers which have continuous depolarization along their length.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
