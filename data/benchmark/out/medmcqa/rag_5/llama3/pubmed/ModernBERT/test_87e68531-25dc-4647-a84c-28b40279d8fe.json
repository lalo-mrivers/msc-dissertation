["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the provided documents, we can infer that the inheritance pattern is related to sex. The first document states that the risk of having an affected child is high if both parents are affected or if one parent is affected and belongs to an affected family. This suggests a possible X-linked inheritance. The second document does not provide any relevant information about the inheritance pattern. The third document discusses the relationship between 45,X/46,XX mosaic and multiple spontaneous abortions, but it does not provide any information about the inheritance of the condition in question. The fourth document is unrelated to the topic. Therefore, we can rule out autosomal recessive, mitochondrial, and X-linked dominant inheritance patterns. This leaves us with X-linked recessive as the possible inheritance pattern.\",\n\"answer_choice\": A"]
