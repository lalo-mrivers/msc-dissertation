["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents provided focus on various aspects of mandibular bone reconstruction and fractures. In 'Immediate reconstruction of an orbital complex fracture with autogenous mandibular bone', a fracture of the zygomaticomaxillary complex is discussed, which does not directly relate to the proximal segment of mandibular angle fracture. The same can be said for 'Herniation in the intact falciform ligament' and 'Lateral dislocation of the elbow'. In 'Reconstruction of the central mandible with a single block of iliac bone', a reconstruction is described, but not specifically addressing the proximal segment of mandibular angle fracture. Finally, '[About the face value of the cleft of the articulus mandibulae]' provides information on planimetry and mandibular joints, which does not directly relate to the direction of displacement for the proximal segment of mandibular angle fracture.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
