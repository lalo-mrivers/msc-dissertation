["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the routes by which Midazolam cannot be given. From the provided documents, none of them mention Midazolam or its administration routes. However, we can infer from the information available that Midazolam is an inhalational agent (refer to 'Advantages and guidelines for mask induction').
