["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the correct answer, we need to consider the documents provided. The relevant document is 'A method for using reversible hydrocolloid at high altitudes.' This study mentions that high-altitude boiling of reversible hydrocolloid in water alone is inadequate and must be liquefied at a temperature of at least 100 degrees C (212 degrees F). The use of propylene glycol alone in the liquefying bath or as an additive to water is effective in attaining this temperature. This suggests that we are dealing with the concept of boiling water and changing it into vapor. Latent heat refers to the amount of energy required for a change of state, such as from liquid to gas or solid to liquid. Therefore, the correct answer must be related to the amount of heat required for this process.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
