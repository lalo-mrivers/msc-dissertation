["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the maximum voltage of R wave. Since the ECG shows a mean axis of 90 degrees, this suggests that the heart is aligned nearly perpendicular to the chest wall, which means that the cardiac vector is pointing towards the right side of the chest. This information can be used to predict the lead with the maximum R wave voltage.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom the given documents, there are no direct references to ECG or electrical activity of the heart. However, we can apply general knowledge about ECG and the concept of mean axis to approach this question.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe answer will depend on the direction of the cardiac vector, which is influenced by the mean axis. Since the mean axis is 90 degrees, it's likely that the cardiac vector is pointing towards the right side of the chest.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom this information, we can predict that the maximum R wave voltage would be in lead III.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
