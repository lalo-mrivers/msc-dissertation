["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for the minimum width required in the ridge to accommodate two implants of size 4 mm. The key phrase here is 'ridge', which suggests that we are dealing with a dental implant procedure. In the provided documents, there is no specific information about implant placement or dental brackets. However, one document does mention biomechanical investigation of friction on bracket form, which could be relevant to this problem. According to this document, the groove lengths and hence bracket widths should be selected accordingly. This implies that each tooth (or in this case, ridge) should be seen as part of the whole system. Based on this consideration, we can infer that the minimum width required for two implants of size 4 mm would depend on the spacing between them. Assuming a standard implant spacing, the minimum width required would likely be greater than twice the diameter of an individual implant (8 mm). Therefore, I will choose an option that is higher than 8 mm but still reasonable.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C: 17 mm\"\n}"]
