["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about a patient with cough and sputum AFB negative but chest X-ray suggestive of TB. According to RNTCP (Rajiv Gandhi National Tuberculosis Programme), the next step would be to perform a diagnostic test that can confirm or rule out TB. Since the AFB test is already negative, it's unlikely to provide additional information. Therefore, we need to look for other tests that are commonly used in diagnosing TB. Line probe assay (LPA) and nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) are both molecular tests that can detect Mycobacterium tuberculosis DNA. Nucleic acid amplification test is a type of NAAT that amplifies the target DNA sequence, making it more sensitive than culture. Tuberculin test is not directly related to diagnosing TB in this scenario.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"]
