["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the given documents, we can see that lactose intolerance is a common phenomenon, especially among those who are not of Northern European descent. The definition of lactose intolerance is an inability to digest milk, which is related to lactase deficiency. Considering the options, we can eliminate Yoghu (C) as it is a fermented product and would likely contain enzymes to break down lactose. We can also eliminate Ice cream (D) as it is a mixture of milk and other ingredients, but lactose intolerance would not be directly caused by ice cream itself.\n\nNow, let's analyze the remaining options: Condensed Milk (A) and Skimmed Milk (B). Both are types of milk, but condensed milk has been processed to remove excess water and increase its lactose concentration. This processing could potentially induce lactase production in individuals with lactose intolerance. On the other hand, skimmed milk is a type of whole milk from which fat has been removed, but it still contains lactose.\n\nGiven that lactose intolerance is caused by an inability to digest lactose, and considering the processing involved in condensed milk, I would conclude that Condensed Milk (A) is the least likely to cause lactose intolerance among these options.\",\n\"answer_choice\": A"]
