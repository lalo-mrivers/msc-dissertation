["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about which muscle does NOT work for inversion of the foot. The options provided are related to muscles that control movements of the foot. Tibialis anterior is a muscle responsible for dorsiflexion (upward movement) and supination (turning outward) of the foot, whereas Tibialis posterior is involved in plantarflexion (downward movement), inversion (turning inward), and rotation of the foot. Peroneus longus is responsible for eversion (turning outward) and ankle rotation. Extensor hallucis longus is a muscle that extends the great toe. Based on this information, it can be inferred that Tibialis anterior and Peroneus longus do not work for inversion of the foot because they have opposite actions or do not directly control the movement.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
