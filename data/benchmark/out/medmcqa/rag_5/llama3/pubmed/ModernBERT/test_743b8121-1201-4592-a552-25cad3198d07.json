["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about a yellowish white soft sticky deposit loosely adherent present on tooth surface. From the given documents, the first one describes myiasis of wounds with fly larva of the Lucilia type, which is not relevant to this topic. The second document discusses enamel bonding and restoration, but it doesn't mention any deposits. The third document talks about ringed enamel hyperplasia, an enamel disorder, which is also unrelated to tooth surface deposits. The fourth document describes deposition of substances within hydrophilic lenses, which are contact lenses, and mentions tear film components. Based on this information, we can eliminate A and D as they don't match the description of a yellowish white soft sticky deposit. B is unlikely because it would be food debris, not a specific type of deposit. Therefore, the only remaining option is C: Plaque.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"]
