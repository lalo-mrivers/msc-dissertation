["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Since there is no mention of infectious mononucleosis or the relevant diseases (e.g. I-cell disease) in the provided documents, we need to look for clues that might relate to the question. One document stands out - [Infections model involving the mouse in experimental burns]. This suggests an infection-related topic, which aligns with infectious mononucleosis. However, there is no specific mention of mononucleosis or EBV/CMV/HIV in this document either.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe other documents seem unrelated to infectious mononucleosis. Therefore, we must rely on our general knowledge and consider the topic as a whole. Infectious mononucleosis is typically caused by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV).\\r\\n\\r\\nBased on this information, it is reasonable to conclude that EBV is the causative agent of infectious mononucleosis.\\r\\n\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
