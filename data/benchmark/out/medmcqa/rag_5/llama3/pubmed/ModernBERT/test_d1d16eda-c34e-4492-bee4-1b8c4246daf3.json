["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the enzyme deficiency that prevents vitamin C from being synthesized in humans. We need to look for relevant information on vitamin C synthesis. According to 'The action and uses of insulin', we don't find anything related to vitamin C synthesis or deficiency. However, if we look at the other documents, we see that they are discussing different topics such as metabolic disturbances in CAPD patients, selective methylation, carbohydrate conversion to fat, and retinoic acid's morphogen role. None of these documents provide information on vitamin C synthesis. Therefore, we need to consider the question's wording carefully.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
