["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Thiazides are known to increase sodium reabsorption in the kidneys. As a result, urinary sodium excretion would decrease. Potassium levels can be affected by thiazides as they inhibit the absorption of potassium in the gut. This could lead to increased potassium excretion in the urine. Calcium is not directly related to thiazide administration, so it would likely remain unchanged.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B: Sodium and potassium decreases, calcium decreases\""]
