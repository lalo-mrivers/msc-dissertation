["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the potential generated due to movement of freely diffusible ions across a semi-permeable membrane. The relevant documents mention Nernst-Planck electrodiffusion equations and ion flow through a membrane. From these, I infer that the equation used to calculate this potential is a modification or application of the original Nernst equation. Therefore, the correct answer is...\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"]
