["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about symphyseal fracture with lag screw fixation. The relevant documents are the ones related to orthopedic surgery. The document 'Continuous transphyseal traction: experimental observations' discusses the lengthening of canine tibias through continuous transphyseal distraction. This implies that a similar approach could be used for fracture treatment, including symphyseal fractures. Lag screw fixation is also mentioned in this document, which suggests that it may be a suitable method for treating such fractures. Based on these findings, the answer would likely relate to load sharing or adaptation osteosynthesis.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
