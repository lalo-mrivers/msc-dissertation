["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the centre of rotation during intrusion. Intrusion refers to the movement of teeth into the alveolar bone. The relevant document that provides information on this topic is [Luxatio pedis subtalo]. However, since this document is not specifically about dental anatomy or orthodontics, we need to look for other sources. The most relevant document in this case is [Duplication of the rectum], which discusses anatomical structures and their relationships. Based on our understanding of dental anatomy, the centre of rotation during intrusion is at the CEJ (cementoenamel junction).\", \"answer_choice\": C}"]
