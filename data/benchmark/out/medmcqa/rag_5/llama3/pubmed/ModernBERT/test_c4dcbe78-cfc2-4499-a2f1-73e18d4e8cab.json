["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the common complication of prilocaine. Prilocaine is not mentioned in any of the provided documents. However, we can look for similar local anesthetics that have side effects described. Enflurane (ethrane) is a inhalational anaesthetic agent and does not seem related to prilocaine. The next document describes CT1341 anaesthetic which is a steroid anaesthetic and does not mention prilocaine either. Then we have the documents about phenothiazine derivatives and buprenorphine, neither of which mentions prilocaine or its side effects. We can conclude that prilocaine is not mentioned in any of these documents, so we need to look outside for information about its common complications. According to other sources, the most common complication of prilocaine is methemoglobinemia.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
