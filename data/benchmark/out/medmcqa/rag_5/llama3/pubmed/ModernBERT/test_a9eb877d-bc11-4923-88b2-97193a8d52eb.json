["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about delayed development in a 3-year-old child. None of the given milestones are typically expected at this age. However, I can look for relevant information in the provided documents. The most promising document is 'Parental recall of children's early development.' It suggests that certain aspects of development were well remembered by mothers, but others, including some speech milestones, were not recalled accurately. This implies that there may be a developmental milestone expected around this age. In the same document, it also mentions that certain aspects of development were well remembered; others, including some speech milestones, were not recalled accurately. This suggests that these milestones are typical and expected at this age. None of the given options seem to fit the description, so I will look for information on typical developmental milestones around this age.\n\nAccording to 'Body-weight-development of children in GÃ¶rlitz,' by the time a child is 3 years old, they should be able to walk independently. This milestone is not included among the given options.\n\nHowever, in 'Toward a modification of the indices of neonatal prematurity,' it is mentioned that traditional indices of neonatal prematurity were excessively high for predicting developmental lag at 1 yr., and alternative cut-off scores were suggested. Prematurity indices were especially important for infants with below-average development. This suggests that premature birth can affect development, which may result in delayed development.\n\nIn 'Why many placed children have learning difficulties,' it is mentioned that a child's normal development from infantile to adult narcissism may be disrupted by placement. The reactions and defenses may cause serious problems in school learning. This implies that placement or premature birth can affect development, which may result in delayed development.\n\nBased on the provided information, I will look for typical developmental milestones around this age. According to 'Almost eleven million special children,' it is mentioned that certain aspects of development were well remembered; others, including some speech milestones, were not recalled accurately. This suggests that these milestones are typical and expected at this age.\n\nOne typical milestone around this age is the ability to walk independently. However, none of the given options seem to fit this description.\n\nBased on the provided information, I can conclude that delayed development in a 3-year-old child should be called the absence of typical developmental milestones such as walking independently. However, none of the given options seem to fit this description.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
