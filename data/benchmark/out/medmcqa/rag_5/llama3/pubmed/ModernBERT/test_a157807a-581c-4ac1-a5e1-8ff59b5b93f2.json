["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents are about medical equipment and techniques. The question is asking how to remove centric interference. This could be related to electromyography or spine correction techniques. After reviewing the documents, I found that there is no mention of centric interference in the context of phacoemulsification (eye surgery) or transversal loading system in spine correction. However, in the document about Strafoplan logging, it mentions low-frequency attenuation of motor unit potentials which could be related to centric interference in electromyography. The solution mentioned is the blanket principle method that bridges the gap between single-fiber and conventional electromyography. This method is used to reveal abnormal complexity and instability of the motor unit.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"]
