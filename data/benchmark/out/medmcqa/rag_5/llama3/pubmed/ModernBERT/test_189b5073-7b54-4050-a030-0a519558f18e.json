["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about Mass Drug Administration (MDA) being helpful or effective for all except a certain condition. MDA involves administering medications to a large group of people in order to treat or prevent a disease. Based on the documents provided, there is no information that directly answers this question. However, one document mentions 'Excepted Substances', which could be related to this topic. Upon further analysis, it seems that MDA might not be effective for treating conditions where individualized treatment is necessary, such as diseases that require a precise dosage or monitoring of the patient's response. With this in mind, I can eliminate options A, B, and C, as these conditions may require individualized treatment. Option D, Scabies, could potentially be treated with MDA, as it is an infectious disease that affects large groups of people.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
