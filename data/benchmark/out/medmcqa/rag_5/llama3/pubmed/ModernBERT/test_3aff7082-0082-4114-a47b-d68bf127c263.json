["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the cells most commonly affected in glaucomatous optic atrophy. Glaucoma is a condition characterized by damage to the optic nerve, often resulting from increased pressure inside the eye. The relevant document for this question would be related to the pathology of glaucoma. Upon reviewing the provided documents, none of them directly relate to glaucoma or its effects on the optic nerve. However, one document does describe changes in the peripheral retina (Retinal vascular changes in bull's eye maculopathy). This could potentially be a manifestation of glaucomatous damage to the optic nerve.\n\nIn this case, the most commonly affected cells in glaucomatous optic atrophy would likely be Ganglion cells. These cells are responsible for transmitting visual information from the retina to the brain and are the first cells to be damaged in glaucoma.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
