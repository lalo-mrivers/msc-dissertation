["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents provided are related to cerebrovascular arrest, brain death, radionuclide angiography, retinal detachment, and chicken embryo inoculation. Since the question is about radiation causing cell death, we need to focus on the information that relates to radiation or ionizing radiation. The document that stands out in this regard is [Radioisotope diagnosis of brain death]. This suggests that radiolabeled isotopes are used for diagnostic purposes, which implies that ionizing radiation is being utilized. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that radiation causes cell death by C: Ionization.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"]
