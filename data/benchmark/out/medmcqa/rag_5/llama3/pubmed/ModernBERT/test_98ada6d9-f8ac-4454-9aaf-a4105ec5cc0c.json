["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is referring to the fracture mandible posterior to the site of fracture. The relevant document that provides information about jaw reconstruction with fixation plates helps understand this scenario. According to the document [Jaw reconstruction with fixation plates], when complicated fractures are involved, the combined employment of osteosynthesis with steel wires and fixation plates is advised. This suggests that the bone is being stabilized through the use of internal fixation plates. In this context, loading the fracture mandible posterior to the site of fracture would likely result in compression on the upper border (A) as the plate helps to distribute the force.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
