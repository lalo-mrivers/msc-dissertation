["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The positive predictive value of a screening test is the proportion of true positives among all screen positives. To calculate it, we need to consider both true positives and false positives. However, we also need to account for false negatives, which are not part of our denominator. Since the question asks about the calculation of the positive predictive value, we only care about true and false positives. Therefore, the correct answer includes all true positives and some false positives.\", \"answer_choice\": C}"]
