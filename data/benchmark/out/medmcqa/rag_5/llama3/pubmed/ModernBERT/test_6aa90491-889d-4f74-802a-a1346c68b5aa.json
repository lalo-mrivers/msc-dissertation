["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for the lower limit of the average that can be expected 95% of times. This indicates a confidence interval calculation. Given the mean (30) and standard deviation (1), we can use a confidence interval formula to calculate the lower limit. The z-score corresponding to the 95th percentile is approximately -1.645. We can calculate the lower limit as mean - (z-score * SD). Therefore, the lower limit would be 30 - (-1.645 * 1) = 31.65.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
