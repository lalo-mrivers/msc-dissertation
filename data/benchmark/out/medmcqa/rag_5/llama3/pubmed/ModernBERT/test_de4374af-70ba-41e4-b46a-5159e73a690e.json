["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the transmission of occlusal forces to teeth through occlusal rests in full tooth-borne dentures. The provided documents describe various studies on dental restoration and occlusion, but none directly address the transmission of occlusal forces through occlusal rests. Therefore, we must look for information that indirectly relates to this topic. In the document 'Relationship between the width of the occlusal table and pressures under dentures during function', it is mentioned that pressure transducers made contact at selected sites along the residual ridge, indicating that some pressure was transmitted through the occlusal table. This implies that a portion of the occlusal forces may be transmitted to the teeth through the occlusal rests, but does not provide a specific percentage.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
