["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Since the question is about the auriculotemporal nerve, we should look for information related to this nerve. One of the provided documents talks about the network of middle meningeal veins. This document mentions a particular pattern for each genus, including an important frontal branch and constancy of the petrosquamous sinus. This makes us think that the auriculotemporal nerve might be related to the middle meningeal vein. Additionally, we have another document talking about the VIIIth cranial nerve in the frog, which mentions degenerations showing that both roots project onto the ventral and dorsal vestibular nuclei. Although this is a different species and a different type of nerve, it gives us an idea of how nerves can be double-rooted. Therefore, we should look for information about the auriculotemporal nerve in one of these documents or try to find common ground between them.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
