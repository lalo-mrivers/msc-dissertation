["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the movement of a permanent second molar if a permanent first molar is lost. The relevant document that mentions this scenario is '[Secondary retention of a permanent tooth]', which describes a case where a lower first molar was re-included in the mandible. This suggests that the adjacent teeth, including the permanent second molar, can move in response to the loss of the first molar. The text does not provide specific information about the direction of movement, but it is common knowledge that the permanent second molar will drift mesially (forward) if a first molar is lost.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"]
