["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the material used in its pure form in dentistry. One of the provided documents is 'Denture marking for identification.' This document doesn't provide information about the material used in its pure form. Another document, '[A method for determining arsenic in biological material]', talks about extracting and detecting arsenic in biologic material but it's not related to dentistry or using materials in their pure form. The 'Clinical development of glass-ionomer cement' describes various applications of this cement, including filling material, sealant, and luting agent. However, these applications are not mentioned as being done with the material in its pure form. Finally, '[On the technique of applying drugs in solid form to rats]' is about administering drugs in solid form using hardgelatin mini-caps, which doesn't provide any information relevant to this question. Based on the provided documents, it seems that 'Denture marking for identification' might have a connection with dentistry. The document mentions denture base material and patient's name inclusion. This could be related to dental materials. However, since there is no direct mention of the material used in its pure form, we need to consider other options.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
