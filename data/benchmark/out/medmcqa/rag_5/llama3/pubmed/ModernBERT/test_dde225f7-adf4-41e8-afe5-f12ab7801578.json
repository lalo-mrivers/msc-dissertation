["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents provide information on radiography techniques, including pelvimetry and periapical radiography. The concept of filters is discussed in the context of megavoltage x-ray therapy and electromyography. Since the question is about placing an aluminium filter in the primary beam of radiation, I will focus on the documents that mention filtration or shielding. In 'Absolute kilovoltage calibration of a diagnostic x-ray generator', it is mentioned that a Ge(Li) detector relies on the direct observation of the onset of fluorescence radiation from scattering foils placed in the primary beam. This suggests that filtration can be used to control the intensity of the radiation. In 'The inverse compensating filter', filters are discussed as a means to achieve entrance dose uniformity in megavoltage x-ray therapy. Based on this information, it appears that the principal reason for placing an aluminium filter in the primary beam is to reduce radiation.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
