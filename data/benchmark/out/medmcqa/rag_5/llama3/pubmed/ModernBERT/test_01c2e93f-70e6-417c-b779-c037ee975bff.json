["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents suggest that the release of synaptic vesicle from presynaptic terminal is influenced by calcium influx. In 'Phenobarbital increases spontaneous transmitter release at the frog neuromuscular junction', it was found that phenobarbital probably acts presynaptically to increase the presynaptic free calcium concentration, leading to increased transmitter release. This suggests that a decrease in calcium influx could inhibit synaptic vesicle release. Furthermore, 'Spontaneous miniature potentials in primary afferent fibres' mentions spontaneous synaptic activity possibly related to firing of presynaptic inhibitory fibres, which may also be influenced by calcium levels.\", \"answer_choice\": C}"]
