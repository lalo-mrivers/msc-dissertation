["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question describes a diffuse spreading inflammatory lesion caused by bacterial enzyme. The provided documents describe various types of infections, abscesses, and hypersensitive reactions. None of the described conditions seem directly related to this type of inflammatory lesion. However, one document mentions Proteus mirabilis as possible pathogens in an infection, which could be the cause of the spreading inflammation. Additionally, a different document describes a reaction caused by a latex balloon on a rectal catheter, which does not seem relevant to the current question. A bone scan artifact is also mentioned, but it seems unrelated to bacterial enzymes and inflammatory lesions. Therefore, based on the provided information, it seems that Hyaluronidase could be the correct answer.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
