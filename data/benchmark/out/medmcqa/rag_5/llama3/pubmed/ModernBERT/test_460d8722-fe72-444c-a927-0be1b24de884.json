["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the nerve supply of the adrenal gland. The relevant documents mention the morphology of the heart conduction system, the taste system, retinoic acid, and granulation tissue in the umbilical cord. However, none of these topics directly relate to the adrenal gland's nerve supply.\\r\\n\\r\\nLet us consider a different approach. The sympathetic nervous system is responsible for the release of catecholamines from the adrenal medulla. Preganglionic fibers from the lower thoracic and lumbar vertebrae reach the superior cervical ganglion, which innervates the adrenal gland.\\r\\n\\r\\nBased on this information, we can conclude that the preganglionic fibers from the lower thoracic and lumbar vertebrae come to supply the adrenals.\", \"answer_choice\": B}"]
