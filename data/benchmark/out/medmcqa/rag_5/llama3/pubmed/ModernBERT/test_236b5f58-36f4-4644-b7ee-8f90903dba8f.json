["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about suggestive signs of domestic violence in a child. The provided documents are related to incest, alcoholism, transient psychotic episodes, self-injuries, and divorce. I will review the characteristics of parents involved in father-daughter incest, familial relationships in families with an alcoholic parent, and self-injuries of condemned subjects. None of these texts seem directly relevant to domestic violence. However, one text does mention court-ordered visitation studies of a 6-year-old child, which could be related to domestic violence. The study recommends the sole custodial parent regulate visitation with the noncustodial parent. This suggests that the question might be asking about physical signs of abuse rather than psychological or behavioral indicators. Upon reviewing the options, I notice that they all seem to be types of fractures. Given this context, I believe the correct answer is related to physical signs of abuse.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
