It discusses the most common causative organisms for superficial sepsis and their anatomical predilections. Given that MRSA (Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus) was found in a nurse's anterior nares, it is likely that this is a case of community-acquired MRSA infection rather than hospital-acquired. Therefore, the treatment should target the nasal colonization, and topical therapy would be more effective than systemic therapy.
