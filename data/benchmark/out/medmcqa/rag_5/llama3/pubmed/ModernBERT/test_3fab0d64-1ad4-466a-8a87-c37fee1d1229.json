["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about a 14-year-old male child with abnormal body movements. The MRI shows signal changes in the corpus striatum, thalami, pons, medulla, centrum semiovale, and asymmetric diffuse white matter involvement. This information suggests a possible genetic disorder affecting the brain's movement control centers. The corpus striatum is part of the basal ganglia, which are involved in movement disorders like Parkinsonism. Thalamic lesions can also be seen in Wilson's disease. Medulla oblonga involvement is common in Hallervorden-Spatz disease. Centrum semiovale and pons involvement are not specific to any one condition but can be seen in various neurodegenerative diseases.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
