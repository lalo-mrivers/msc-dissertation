["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The modified Bishop score is calculated based on the cervical dilatation (0-2 cm), effacement (0-100%), position of the fetal vertex (0-5 station), and consistency of the cervix (0-3). Since the cervix is 1 cm dilated, it falls under 2 points. The cervix being soft and posterior does not add any additional points to the score. Effacement is 30%, which corresponds to 25% in the Bishop scale, adding another point. As the vertex is at -1 station, this subtracts 1 from the overall score. Therefore, the total score would be 2 + 1 - 1 = 2.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
