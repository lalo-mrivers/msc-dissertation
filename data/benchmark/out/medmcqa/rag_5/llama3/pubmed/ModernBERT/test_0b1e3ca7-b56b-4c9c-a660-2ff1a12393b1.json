["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant document that discusses insulin is 'Relaxin: a disulfide homolog of insulin'. This document mentions the amino acid sequences of relaxin's A and B chains. Relaxin is identical to insulin with respect to its disulfide bond distribution, but has significant homology lacking in other positions. This suggests that relaxin and insulin were derived from a common ancestral gene. Frederick Banting and Charles Best discovered the structure and amino acid sequence of insulin.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
