["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To calculate the base deficit, I need to first determine the base excess using the nomogram developed for acid-base equilibrium in sheep's blood. Since the question is about a patient with a pH = 6.96, pCO2 = 30 mm Hg and HCO3- = 6 mEq/L, I would look at the relevant nomogram to find the corresponding base excess value. Unfortunately, this information is not provided in the given documents, so I would need additional data to proceed. However, since the question only asks for the calculation of base deficit, not base excess, I will assume that the base excess is already known and proceed with the calculation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"None\""]
