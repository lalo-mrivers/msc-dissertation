["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has undergone transsphenoidal hypophysectomy for pituitary tumour. This means the patient's pituitary gland has been removed or damaged. The pituitary gland regulates hormone production in the body. ACTH, TSH, FSH, and LH are all hormones produced by the pituitary gland. Therefore, it is likely that the patient has a deficiency of these hormones. The question asks which hormone will not be given to the patient. Given that the patient lacks ACTH, TSH, FSH, and LH, it is logical to assume that none of these hormones will be given to the patient. However, there are additional options provided. Among the remaining options, estradiol is an estrogen hormone typically produced by the ovaries in women or the testes in men. As the pituitary gland regulates hormone production, a deficiency of FSH and LH would likely also result in low estradiol levels. Therefore, it is unlikely that estradiol will be given to the patient.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
