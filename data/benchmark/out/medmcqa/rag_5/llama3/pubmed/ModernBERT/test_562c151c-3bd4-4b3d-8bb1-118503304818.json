["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking why endontically treated posterior teeth are more susceptible to fracture than untreated ones. Looking at the provided documents, there are no specific mentions about loss of moisture or hollow canals being a cause of increased susceptibility to fracture. However, it does mention that two methods have been described for dealing with fractured or underextended posts in endodontically treated teeth, which suggests that endodontic treatment itself may be contributing to the risk of fracture. Additionally, the procedure for repairing fractured post-core restorations implies that fractures can occur even after endodontic treatment. This information supports the idea that loss of coronal structure is a possible reason why endodontically treated posterior teeth are more susceptible to fracture.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"]
