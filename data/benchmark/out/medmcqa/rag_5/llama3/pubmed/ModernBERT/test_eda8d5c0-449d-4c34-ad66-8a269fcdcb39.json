["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"There is no mention of the enzyme's activity being affected by biotin deficiency in the provided documents. However, we can analyze the enzymes mentioned in each document. In the first document, NADP-specific glutamate dehydrogenase is not involved in repression of yeast sporulation by ammonia. This suggests that glutamate dehydrogenase might be a different enzyme. The second and third documents discuss iopamidol and performic acid, but there's no mention of biotin or its deficiency. The fourth document describes the rate-limiting steps in metabolic pathways and mentions phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, which is not related to biotin. The fifth document discusses superoxide dismutase, an enzyme whose activity is not affected by biotin deficiency. Therefore, we can conclude that the answer lies in the enzymes mentioned in the first document.\", \"answer_choice\": A}"]
