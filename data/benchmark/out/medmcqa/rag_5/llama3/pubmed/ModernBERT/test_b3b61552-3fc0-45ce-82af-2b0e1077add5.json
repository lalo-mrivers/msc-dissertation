["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about mandibular fracture managed by adapting mini plates. The relevant documents are about various surgical instruments and techniques, but none of them specifically mention mandibular fractures or mini plates. Therefore, we need to consider the general concepts of osteosynthesis. Load bearing osteosynthesis refers to a technique where the implant bears the load of the surrounding bone. Load sharing involves distributing the load across multiple bones or implants. Non-rigid osteosynthesis implies a flexible plate that does not provide stability. Rigid osteosynthesis, on the other hand, is characterized by a stable and unyielding plate. Given these definitions, we can infer that adapting mini plates for mandibular fracture management likely involves rigid fixation to achieve stability.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
