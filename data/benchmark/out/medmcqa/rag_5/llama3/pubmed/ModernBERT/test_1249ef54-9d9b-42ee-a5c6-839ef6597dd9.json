["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Since the question is about CHX mouthwash daily use for streptococcus mutanus, I need to find relevant information about the effectiveness of CHX against streptococcus. However, none of the provided documents mention streptococcus mutanus or its susceptibility to CHX. Therefore, I will focus on finding general information about CHX and its activity against bacteria.\n\nCHX is an antibacterial agent commonly used in mouthwashes for its antimicrobial properties. From the provided documents, I can see that CHX is mentioned in the first document as a treatment option, but it does not specify its effectiveness against streptococcus mutanus.\n\nSince there is no specific information about CHX's effectiveness against streptococcus mutanus, I will rely on general knowledge about CHX. CHX has been shown to be effective against various types of bacteria, including oral pathogens.\n\nBased on this general information and the lack of specific data for streptococcus mutanus, I can conclude that daily use of CHX mouthwash for 2 weeks is likely effective in reducing the population of streptococcus mutanus. However, this conclusion should be interpreted with caution since it is based on general knowledge rather than specific scientific evidence.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
