["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is an adolescent school girl with a family history of epilepsy. She experiences precipitating symptoms during morning and exams, suggesting a specific trigger. The EEG shows epileptic spikes. Considering the provided documents, the most relevant information is the description of spike discharges in response to intellectual activity (mental arithmetic) in a 67-year-old woman. This suggests that intellectual activity can cause spike discharges on an EEG. Additionally, there are cases described where reflex epilepsy is triggered by tactile stimuli or specific types of intellectual activity.

The most likely diagnosis would be a form of reflex epilepsy.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
