["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking when NK cells are effective against viral infected cells. From the provided documents, we can see that peritoneal macrophages provide a convenient source of syngeneic target cells and show high levels of specific 51Cr release when exposed to T cells from LCM immune mice. This suggests that MHC class I proteins are involved in the recognition of viral-infected cells by T cells. Neutrophils are also mediators of antiviral immunity, but this does not directly relate to NK cell activity. The interaction between tick-borne encephalitis virus and porcine kidney embryo cells is also unrelated to the question. Therefore, based on the information provided, we can conclude that MHC class I proteins must be expressed by the infected cell for NK cells to be effective.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
