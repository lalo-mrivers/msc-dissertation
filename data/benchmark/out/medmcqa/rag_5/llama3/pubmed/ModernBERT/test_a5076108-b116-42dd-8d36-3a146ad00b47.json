["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about a material that turns to liquid on applying critical shear stress. This characteristic is described as Bingham body. The relevant documents provide information on non-Newtonian fluids and their rheological properties. Specifically, the document 'Rheological properties of human blood plasma--a comparison of measurements with three different viscometers' mentions that plasma is a non-Newtonian fluid with pseudoplastic rheological behavior. This property is not directly related to the critical shear stress mentioned in the question. However, another document 'The rheological properties of fluid denture-base resins' discusses initial non-Newtonian flow behavior and increased viscosity with time, which is also not relevant to the critical shear stress.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
