["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"I will review the relevant documents to find information about Kiesselbach's plexus. According to the document '[Rare variation of the cubital artery]', it does not mention Kiesselbach's plexus or its branches. The document '[Intra-osseous vascularization of the astragalus]' is unrelated to Kiesselbach's plexus. In the document 'Organic constipation in adults', there is no mention of Kiesselbach's plexus either. The documents 'An unusual cause of blocked reduction of the Galeazzi injury' and 'Hyoid syndrome' do not provide any information about Kiesselbach's plexus or its branches. Since none of the provided documents have relevant information, I will rely on general knowledge about Kiesselbach's plexus. It is a plexus of vessels in the nasal cavity formed by the posterior ethmoidal, anterior ethnoidal, and spheopalatine arteries. The branches of external carotid artery that form this plexus are not mentioned among the given options.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
