["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the role of dental pulp in resorption of roots of primary teeth. We are given information about root canals of deciduous teeth, which have been demonstrated by the epoxy resin injection technique. This suggests that there is a connection between the root canal system and the resorption process. Furthermore, we see examples of unusual displacements of lower molars and maturation of residual tissue left in the jaw after injury, but none of these cases directly relate to the resorption of roots of primary teeth. We do have a case report about an odontoma preventing the eruption of a molar, but this does not seem relevant either. Considering all the information provided, we are left with understanding of root canal systems in deciduous teeth and how they might be connected to resorption.\", \"answer_choice\": A}"]
