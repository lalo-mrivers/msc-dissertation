["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about an anti-cholinergic drug that doesn't cross the blood brain barrier and placenta. There are no relevant documents provided to directly answer this question. However, we can look at each option carefully. A, B, C, and D are all types of hyoscine. Atropine is a type of anticholinergic. From the given documents, there is no mention of blood brain barrier crossing or placenta passage for any of these drugs. Therefore, we need to rely on general knowledge of these drugs. Glycopyrrolate bromide and Atropine are the most commonly used anti-cholinergics that do not cross the blood brain barrier. Glycopyrrolate is known for its limited CNS penetration due to its larger molecular size.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
