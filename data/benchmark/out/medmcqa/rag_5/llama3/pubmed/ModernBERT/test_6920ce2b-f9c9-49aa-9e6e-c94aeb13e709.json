["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about endocrine glands that are not influenced by the pituitary gland. From the provided documents, we can identify which glands are controlled by the pituitary gland and which ones are not.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe pituitary gland regulates the gonadotropin release through the interdependence of the adenohypophysis, ovaries, CNS, and external environment (document 1). This implies that the ovaries are under pituitary control.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlso, the document on Malignant parotid cyst mentions the parotid gland which is regulated by the pituitary gland as part of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe documents do not explicitly mention the thyroid gland being controlled by the pituitary gland. Although it is part of the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis, its regulation can be indirect through the thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH).\\r\\n\\r\\nConsidering the information provided, we can conclude that the adrenal medulla and parathyroids are under pituitary control.\\r\\n\\r\\nBased on this analysis, we can exclude options B and C as they include glands that are under pituitary control.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, let's analyze option D. The pancreas has islets of Langerhans which regulate blood sugar levels through the release of insulin and glucagon. This process does not involve direct pituitary control.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe adrenal cortex regulates cortisol production independently of the pituitary gland.\\r\\n\\r\\nOption D also includes the thyroid gland, which as mentioned earlier has indirect regulation through TRH.\\r\\n\\r\\nTherefore, option D is a combination of glands that are and are not under pituitary control.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
