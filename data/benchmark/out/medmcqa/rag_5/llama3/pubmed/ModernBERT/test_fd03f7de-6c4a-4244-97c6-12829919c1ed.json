["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has a right-side hearing loss with better speech understanding in noisy environments. The audiogram shows a significant gap between AC-BC of the right and left ear. Rinne's test is negative, indicating that air conduction is equally affected on both sides. Weber's test centralised suggests that the sound localises to the middle. Based on these findings, we can rule out Meniere's disease, which typically causes a sudden onset of vertigo and hearing loss. Presbycusis is unlikely as it would not cause a significant gap in audiogram. Vestibular schwannoma may be considered but Weber's test centralised suggests that the sound localises to the middle, which is not typical of vestibular schwannomas. The most likely condition shown is stapedial otosclerosis.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
