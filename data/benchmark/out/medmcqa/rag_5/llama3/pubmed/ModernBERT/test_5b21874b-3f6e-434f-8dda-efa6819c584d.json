["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, I did not find any information directly related to excessive forces of occlusion within physiological limits. However, upon reviewing the content, I noticed that some documents discuss various technical notes and apparatuses for measuring forces in different contexts, such as dental extraction or pelvimetry. Given this information, I will focus on documents that might provide insight into the relationship between forces and periodontal ligament (PDL) width.\n\nThe document 'An apparatus for measuring the forces of dental extraction' describes an apparatus used to measure compressive and rotational forces during tooth extraction. This suggests that excessive forces can be related to dental extraction, but it does not directly address PDL width.\n\nAnother document, '[Concerning upbuilding of a tissue-bank for the ent-specialty (author's transl)]', discusses supramaximal deep-freezing as a method to conserve living tissues and organs. While this is unrelated to excessive forces of occlusion within physiological limits, it provides no information that would affect my answer.\n\nThe remaining documents focus on technical notes regarding electromyography, suction tips, or pelvimetry techniques. None of these provide direct insight into the relationship between forces and PDL width.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the provided documents, I found no direct correlation between excessive forces of occlusion within physiological limits and changes in PDL width.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C: Width will remain same\""]
