["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about a 26-year-old lady with recurrent abortion. The first thought is to look for any relevant document that talks about recurrent abortion. Among the provided documents, [The early diagnosis of teratogenic malformations (author's transl)] stands out as it mentions anencephaly diagnosed through ultrasound. This makes me think that ultrasound might be a useful investigation in this case. However, we are not looking for fetal anomalies here but rather trying to confirm the diagnosis of recurrent abortion. Among the options provided, C: Anti Russel viper venom antibodies seems to be relevant. The next thought is to look up what anti-Russell viper venom antibody tests detect. According to the provided documents, [Primary ovarian choriocarcinoma] reports on a 14-year-old girl who died due to respiratory insufficiency after operation. This might suggest that choriocarcinoma could be a possibility in this case. Choriocarcinoma is known to cause recurrent abortion and is often associated with increased levels of beta subunit human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). The Anti Russel viper venom antibodies test detects the beta subunit of hCG, which makes it a suitable investigation in this case.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
