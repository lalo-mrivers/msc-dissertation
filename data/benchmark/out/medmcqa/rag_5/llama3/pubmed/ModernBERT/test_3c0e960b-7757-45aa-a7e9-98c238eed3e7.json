["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the most common site of zygomatic arch fracture. After reviewing the relevant documents, I didn't find any information specifically about zygomatic arch fractures or their common sites. However, one document discusses an orbital complex fracture with a defect in the infraorbital rim and orbital floor, which is related to the zygomatic arch. The technique for reconstruction involves using the lateral plate of the mandibular ramus. This suggests that the zygomatic arch may be involved in this type of fracture. Based on this information, I will select an answer.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
