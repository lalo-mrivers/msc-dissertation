["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant document is 'Supersensitivity induced by the toxin of Brazilian scorpion venom (Tityus serrulatus Lutz e Mello)'. The text states that TsTX enhances the pharmacological actions of directly and indirectly acting substances, with an enhancing action more pronounced for indirectly acting drugs. This suggests a prejunctional site of action. Secondarily, TsTX also produces an unspecific increase in sensitivity at the level of the pharmacological receptor itself. Since the effect is to enhance the actions of the drug, the answer cannot be antagonist or inverse agonist. The fact that it enhances both directly and indirectly acting substances suggests that the drug binds to activate the receptor.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
