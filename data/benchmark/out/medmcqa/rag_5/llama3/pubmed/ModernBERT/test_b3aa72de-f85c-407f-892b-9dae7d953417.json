["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the given documents, we can see that Povidone-iodine is capable of specifically altering DNA, which may result in mutations. Rifampicin, Metronidazole, and Nitrofurantoin are all antibiotics that target specific bacterial DNA or RNA molecules. Linezolid also targets bacterial protein synthesis by inhibiting peptidyl transferase activity. Therefore, Povidone-iodine is the only one that affects DNA synthesis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
