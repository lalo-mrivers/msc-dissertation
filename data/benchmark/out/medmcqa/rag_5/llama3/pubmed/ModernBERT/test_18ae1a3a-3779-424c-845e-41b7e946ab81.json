["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"In reviewing the relevant documents, I didn't find any information that specifically addresses the sublingual space or its relationship with the submandibular space. However, a general understanding of the anatomy is crucial in answering this question. The sublingual space is located beneath the tongue and extends from the mandible to the mylohyoid muscle. In contrast, the submandibular space lies below the mandible, extending from the mandibular border to the mylohyoid muscle. Given that the sublingual space and the submandibular space are adjacent but separate compartments, it is logical to assume that a boundary exists between them. Upon reviewing the options, I found that the only structure that lies between these two spaces is the fibres of mylohyoid muscle.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
