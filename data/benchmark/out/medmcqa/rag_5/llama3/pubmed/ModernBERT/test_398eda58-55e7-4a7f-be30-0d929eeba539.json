["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Upon reviewing the provided documents, none of them seem to be directly related to coarse tremors of the tongue. Therefore, I will analyze the question and potential choices to determine which option is most likely correct. After considering the possible causes of coarse tremors of the tongue, I conclude that it is not typically associated with Parkinsonism (although Parkinson's disease can cause other symptoms such as tremors). Thyrotoxicosis may cause tremors in some cases, but coarse tremors are not a typical symptom. General paresis is a neurological disorder caused by neurosyphilis, which can cause various motor and sensory symptoms including tremors. However, it is unlikely that general paresis would specifically cause coarse tremors of the tongue. Finally, alcoholism has been known to cause various neurological symptoms, including tremors, although these are typically fine rather than coarse. Given this analysis, I believe the correct answer is B: Alcohol.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
