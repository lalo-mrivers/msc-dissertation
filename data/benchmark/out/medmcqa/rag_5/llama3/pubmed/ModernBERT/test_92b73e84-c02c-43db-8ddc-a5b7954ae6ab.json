["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has a positive culture for Burkholderia cepacia. The document 'Pleural infection caused by Capnocytophaga canimorsus...' talks about pneumonia and empyema due to Capnocytophaga canimorsus, which responded well to antibiotics. This suggests that Burkholderia cepacia is likely to be sensitive to antibiotic treatment as well. The document 'Diphtheria: another risk of travel.' mentions toxigenic Corynebacterium diphtheriae biotype gravis being treated with parenteral penicillin. This implies that penicillin-based antibiotics are effective against certain types of bacterial infections. Since Burkholderia cepacia is a type of pseudomonad, which is often resistant to many antimicrobial agents, the combination of Aminoglycoside and colistin would be an appropriate treatment choice.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
