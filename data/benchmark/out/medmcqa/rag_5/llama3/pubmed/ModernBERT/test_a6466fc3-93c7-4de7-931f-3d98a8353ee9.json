["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Ewing's sarcoma is a type of bone or soft tissue tumor characterized by the presence of small blue round cells. The translocation t(ll;22) is a hallmark genetic abnormality in Ewing's sarcoma, which involves the fusion of the EWS gene with the FLI1 gene. Therefore, to detect this translocation, we need to use a molecular diagnostic approach that can detect chromosomal rearrangements or specific gene fusions. Conventional karyotyping may not be suitable for detecting such a specific genetic abnormality. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) is a broad-based approach that may not have the necessary resolution to detect this specific translocation. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) is an established molecular diagnostic technique that can detect chromosomal rearrangements, including t(ll;22). PCR is a polymerase chain reaction-based approach that can amplify specific DNA sequences, which could be used to detect the EWS-FLI1 fusion gene. However, FISH is more sensitive and specific for detecting chromosomal translocations like t(ll;22), making it the best method to detect this abnormality.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
