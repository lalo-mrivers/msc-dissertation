["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about fibres that are not attached to alveolar bone. The relevant documents do not provide information specific to the types of fibers mentioned in the options. However, one can think step-by-step and consider the context of the question. Alveolar bone is related to teeth, and the temporomandibular joint is also associated with teeth. The study about the disc of the temporomandibular joint does not provide information about fibres attached to alveolar bone. The other documents are unrelated to alveolar bone or the types of fibers mentioned in the options. Therefore, it can be concluded that none of the given options are related to alveolar bone.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
