["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about modifying a property of alginate power. Alginate power is likely referring to dental impression material. The relevant documents mention micro-magnetic retainers and shoe modifications which are not directly related to alginate power. However, one document does discuss modifying the Dennison 'valve' for a spigot, which could be related to alginate power. This makes me think of the paper on dental impression materials. The addition of Mgo (Magnesium oxide) is likely used to modify the setting time or shelf life of the alginate material. Therefore, I will choose an option that relates to the properties of alginate materials.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B: Increases shelf life.\""]
