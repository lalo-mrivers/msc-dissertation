["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking what is false about rapid sequence induction in a cardiac patient. The documents provided are related to various medical topics but none specifically discuss rapid sequence induction or anesthesia techniques. However, general knowledge of anesthesia practices suggests that rapid sequence induction involves the administration of an inducing agent and a neuromuscular relaxant together, as well as the application of cricoid pressure until the endotracheal tube has been secured with a cuff. Pre-oxygenation is also important to minimize the risk of hypoxia during induction.\", \"answer_choice\": D}"]
