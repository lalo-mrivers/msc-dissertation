["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the use of articaine in a child. We need to analyze each option carefully.\\nOption A is correct because articaine is an amide which is metabolized in both plasma and liver. The papers provided do not specifically discuss articaine, but general information on pharmacokinetics can be applied.\\nOptions B, C, and D are related to the use of articaine in a child, so we need to analyze each option.\\nOption B's statement that 'Plasma half-life is 90 min' seems reasonable because adult plasma half-life is around 2-3 hours. The pediatric half-life might be shorter due to age-related physiological differences, but it's not significantly different from the adult value.\\nOption C states that 'Infiltration produces adequate anaesthesia in primary molar so need for block anesthesia is eliminated'. This statement seems reasonable because articaine is commonly used as a local anesthetic for dental procedures. The papers provided do not discuss this specific procedure, but it's supported by general knowledge about articaine.\\nOption D states that 'More breakdown cause less toxicity' which is incorrect. Articaine's metabolism can result in the formation of toxic metabolites.\\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
