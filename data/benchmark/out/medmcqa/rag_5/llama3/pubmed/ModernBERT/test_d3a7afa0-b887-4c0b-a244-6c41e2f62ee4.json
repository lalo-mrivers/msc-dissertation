["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the typical cervical vertebra compared to thoracic vertebra. After reviewing the provided documents, I can see that 'Inclination of the spinous processes of the cervical spine' discusses the biometry of cervical vertebrae and mentions nothing about their body shape or facets. 'Lesions of the cervical spine' talks about surgical treatment options for cervical spine lesions but does not provide information on the typical features of cervical vertebra. 'Development of bony bridge between lumbar vertebrae' and '[Rare variation of the cubital artery]' are irrelevant to this question.\n\nTherefore, I will focus on the description of the typical features of cervical vertebra in comparison with thoracic vertebra. According to various anatomical sources, including Gray's Anatomy, the typical cervical vertebra has a foramen transversarium, which is not present in thoracic vertebrae. This feature is often used as an identifier for distinguishing between cervical and thoracic vertebra.\n\nGiven this information, I can conclude that the correct answer is B: Has a foramen transversarium.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
