["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the tipping of a tooth. The PDL (periodontal ligament) fibers are affected by this process. As per the relevant documents, there is no direct information provided about the PDL fibers in relation to tooth tipping. However, we can infer that the fibers would be stretched on one side and compressed on the other side as the tooth tilts. This reasoning is based on the fact that teeth do not tip without any resistance from surrounding tissues like the periodontal ligament.\", \"answer_choice\": C}"]
