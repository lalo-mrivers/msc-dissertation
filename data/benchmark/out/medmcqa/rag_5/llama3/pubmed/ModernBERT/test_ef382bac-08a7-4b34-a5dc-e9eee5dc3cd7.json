["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Since the question concerns Isosorbide 5—mononitrate, I would first look for relevant information about this substance. Since none of the provided documents mention Isosorbide 5—mononitrate directly, I would then look for clues about its characteristics and possible uses. The document '[Theophylline 7-substitutes. III. Arylderivatives]' mentions the preparation and pharmacological screening of some 7-aryltheophyllines. Although this is not directly related to Isosorbide 5—mononitrate, it does suggest that researchers have developed methods for preparing and testing substances with similar structures. Therefore, I would hypothesize that Isosorbide 5—mononitrate may also have pharmacological properties. The document 'Nitrite test for methaqualone' discusses a simple qualitative test suitable for detecting milligram quantities of methaqualone. This suggests that the authors were interested in detecting small amounts of a substance, which could imply that Isosorbide 5—mononitrate also has specific pharmacological properties.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
