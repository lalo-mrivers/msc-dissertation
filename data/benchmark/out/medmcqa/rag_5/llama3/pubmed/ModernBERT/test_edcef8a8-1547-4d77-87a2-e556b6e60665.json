["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"There is no relevant information about medial squint or paralysis of any nerves related to the presented cases. However, we can look at the anatomy of the extraocular muscles. The medial rectus muscle is responsible for adduction (movement inward). A lesion in this muscle would cause a medial squint. The oculomotor nerve (III) innervates the medial rectus muscle. Therefore, paralysis of the oculomotor nerve would result in a medial squint.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
