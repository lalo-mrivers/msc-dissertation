["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about a 16-year-old girl with primary amenorrhea, hirsutism, irregular bleeding, and infertility diagnosed as PCOS. We need to find the drug that should not be given. Looking at the options, we can rule out Tamoxifen because it's commonly used in hormone therapy for breast cancer and has nothing to do with the symptoms described. Spironolactone is a diuretic medication that can cause hirsutism as a side effect, but it might still be considered for this patient given the diagnosis of PCOS. OCPs (oral contraceptive pills) are a common treatment option for PCOS-related issues like irregular bleeding and infertility. Clomiphene citrate is also used to induce ovulation in women with PCOS. Considering these points, I think the best answer is B: Tamoxifen.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
