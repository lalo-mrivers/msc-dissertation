["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The net filtration pressure is calculated as the difference between the capillary hydrostatic pressure (PGC) and the interstitial fluid pressure (pGC). In this case, PGC = 42 mm Hg and pGC = 12 mm Hg. Therefore, the net filtration pressure is: PGC - pGC = 42 - 12 = 30 mm Hg. However, the question also mentions blood capillary hydrostatic pressure (PBC), which is not directly used in calculating the net filtration pressure. Nonetheless, this value can be useful for understanding the overall pressure gradient.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
