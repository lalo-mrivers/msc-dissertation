["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"This question is about Congo red staining of amyloid under polarized light. The documents provided are unrelated to the topic. However, we can analyze similar cases where Congo red was used. In double staining technique for rat foetus skeletons in teratological studies, alcian blue and alizarin red S were used. This suggests that Congo red might be used to stain certain components. Looking at other cases, we have a mention of India-ink immunoreaction which is viewed under highpower oil-immersion microscopy with an electronic flash. This is unrelated to polarized light or amyloid. A case of unusual picture of localized argyrosis mentions sectio caesarea performed 30 years ago with silver suture material. This does not involve Congo red staining. We have a mention of retinal detachment and autolok band, which also do not relate to this topic. Therefore, we must rely on our general knowledge of biochemical stains like Congo red. In the presence of amyloid under polarized light, Congo red typically exhibits apple green birefringence.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
