["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the comparison of condensing force in spherical alloys versus lathe cut. There are no relevant documents mentioning 'spherical alloys' or 'lathe cut', which suggests that this information is specific to dental materials or implants. VMK conus crowns, for instance, do not mention such a distinction. Esthetic restorations and occlusal stress do not provide any insight into condensing force. Autolok band discusses retinal detachment treatment, while non-union of fractures of the clavicle is about fracture fixation. The blanket principle note does not relate to condensing force. Therefore, we should look for information that relates to dental materials or implants.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
