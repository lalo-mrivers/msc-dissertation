["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the body surface area involved in a child with flame burns involving face, bilateral upper limbs, and front of chest and abdomen. The relevant document is Burns, but none are provided. However, we have case reports on various injuries, including trauma-related cases. We can analyze these cases to look for patterns or clues that might help us estimate the body surface area involved. Upon examining the documents, I found no specific information about burns, but there are descriptions of various types of traumas. One document describes a stab injury to the hand, which does not seem relevant. Another document describes a case of traumatic hemipelvectomy, which is also unrelated to the present question.\n\nThe only case that might provide some insight is the one describing a child who inflicted bite injuries on his newborn brother. This case report does not provide information about burns or body surface area, but it suggests that children can inflict harm on each other, and this might be relevant in estimating the severity of burns. However, without specific information about burns, I cannot make an accurate estimate of the body surface area involved.\n\nBased on the available information, I will rely on general knowledge about burn cases to provide an answer. Flame burns typically involve a significant portion of the body, especially when they affect multiple areas such as face, upper limbs, and chest. A 2-year-old child with such severe burns is likely to have a larger body surface area involved.\n\nThe answer should be around 50-60% based on this reasoning. However, I must emphasize that this is an educated guess rather than a precise calculation.\", \n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
