["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents are about hands and wrists. The 2 hand phantom and Digital flexor tendon irrigation both relate to the hand. Modified suction tip is about delicate tissues which could be in the hand or wrist. Twenty degree angle modification for pelvimetry seems unrelated. Barbers' interdigital hair sinus is about dogs, not humans. Given this information, we can focus on the documents about hands and wrists. The wrist joint is formed by 8 bones: Scaphoid, Lunate, Triquetrum, Pisiform, Trapezium, Trapezoid, Capitate, and Hamate. Radius and Ulna are forearm bones that do not form part of the wrist joint. Therefore, the correct answer is either Radius or Ulna. The question does not provide any information about the interischial distance, so Twenty degree angle modification for pelvimetry cannot be relevant to this question.\", \"answer_choice\": A}"]
