["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about muscles with parallel oriented fibers. The provided documents are not directly related to muscle anatomy or physiology. However, we can make an educated guess by considering the types of muscles that typically have parallel-oriented fibers. These would be muscles that work in a linear motion, such as those involved in movement of the fingers or toes. Based on this information, we can eliminate options C and D as they are not involved in movements requiring parallel-oriented fibers. Option A is also unlikely to have parallel-oriented fibers as it is a muscle involved in hip rotation. Therefore, option B Rectus abdominis is the most likely candidate.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
