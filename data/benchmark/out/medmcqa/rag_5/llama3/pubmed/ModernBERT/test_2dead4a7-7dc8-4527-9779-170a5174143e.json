["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, none of them mention 'GLOBOCAN 2012' or carcinoma of lip. The documents seem to be related to breast cancer, mammography, and thermography. Therefore, I will focus on finding information relevant to data collection worldwide. Upon reviewing the documents, I found that there is no specific information about GLOBOCAN 2012 or how it measures data for carcinoma of lip.

These points suggest that demographic data collection can be done on a worldwide scale.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
