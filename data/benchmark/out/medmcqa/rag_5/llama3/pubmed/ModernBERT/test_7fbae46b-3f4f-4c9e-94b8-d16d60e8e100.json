["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"I will examine the provided documents to identify any mention of a semi-permeable membrane or epithelium that allows certain substances to pass through while restricting others. The first document mentions the nuclear envelope's permeability and size, but it doesn't relate to sulcular epithelium. The second document discusses the permeability of the outer layers of limbus and anterior sclera, which is also not relevant. The third document describes the submucosa's structure and properties, but it doesn't mention a semi-permeable membrane or sulcular epithelium. The fourth document talks about the fenestration of the epithelium lining the roof of the fourth cerebral ventricle, which provides evidence for pores allowing substances to pass through. This information leads me to conclude that the sulcular epithelium acts as a semi-permeable membrane.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"]
