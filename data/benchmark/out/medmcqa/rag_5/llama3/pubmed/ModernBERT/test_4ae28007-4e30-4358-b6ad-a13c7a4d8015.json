["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about monitoring BP of a patient with suspected cardiac tamponade. Cardiac tamponade is a condition where fluid accumulates around the heart, leading to compression and reduced function. To monitor BP accurately in this scenario, we need to consider some specific precautions.\n\nFirstly, deep breathing may not be recommended as it can increase the pressure within the chest cavity, which could worsen the cardiac tamponade. Therefore, option A is incorrect.\n\nThe cuff pressure should not be increased to 20 mm above systolic pressure as this could lead to overestimation of BP and inaccurate monitoring. Option B is also incorrect.\n\nMonitoring BP during expiration is crucial in patients with suspected cardiac tamponade because a pulsus paradoxus (reduction of radial pulse amplitude by >50% during inspiration) may be present, indicating increased intrathoracic pressure. Therefore, option C is correct.\n\nFinally, pulsus paradoxus may indeed not be present in some cases, so option D is incorrect.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"]
