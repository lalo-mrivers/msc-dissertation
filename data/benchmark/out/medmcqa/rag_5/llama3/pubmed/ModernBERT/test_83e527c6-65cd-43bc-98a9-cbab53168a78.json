["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about noncompetitive antagonism. Noncompetitive antagonists bind to a site on the enzyme that is different from the substrate binding site, hence the name 'non-competitive'. They decrease Vmax (maximum velocity) but do not affect Km (Michaelis constant). So, there will be no change in the Km value and Vmax will decrease.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
