["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"A patient on steroid therapy is more susceptible to infections due to immunosuppression. In this case, extraction of chronically infected teeth would require premedication to prevent complications. The correct answer lies in the provided documents. One document discusses valproic acid and its potential side effects, including defective blood clotting and spontaneous hemorrhage. This suggests that the patient may be at risk for bleeding complications during surgery. Another document discusses iatrogenic disease in pediatric dentistry, which includes cases of endodontic treatment. However, this does not provide insight into steroid therapy or premedication for extraction. The other documents do not directly relate to this scenario. Therefore, considering the patient's steroid therapy and potential bleeding complications, atropine may be used to reduce the hazard of vagal stimulation and cardiac arrest.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
