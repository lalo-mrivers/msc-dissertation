["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Upon reviewing the documents, I found no direct mention of denture base materials or their ideal properties. However, one document discusses abutment stabilization using a nonresilient gingival bar connector for removable partial dentures. Another document presents cases related to dental procedures and impression materials, but does not specifically address denture base materials. Finally, the fourth document describes an autolok band for retinal detachment, which is unrelated to denture base materials. Given the absence of relevant information in these documents, I can conclude that the question's assumption about ideal denture base material properties is not supported by the provided texts.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
