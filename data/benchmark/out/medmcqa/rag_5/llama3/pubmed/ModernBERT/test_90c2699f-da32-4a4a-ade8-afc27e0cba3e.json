["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking what is true about adult polycystic kidney disease (PKD) except the option provided. From the relevant documents, we can see that autosomal dominant inheritance is mentioned in [A newborn infant with an adult-type kidney disease] as a characteristic of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease. Similarly, hypertension being rare and cysts occurring in liver, lungs, and pancreas are also characteristics of PKD. Pyelonephritis being common is not explicitly stated in the documents but it's a known complication of PKD. Therefore, option D (Pyelonephritis is common) seems to be true about adult polycystic kidney disease.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
