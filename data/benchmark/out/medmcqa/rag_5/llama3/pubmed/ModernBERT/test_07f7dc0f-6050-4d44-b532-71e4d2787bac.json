["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about muscles that will tend to pull the mandible back following bilateral mandibular fracture in the canine region. The key here is to identify which muscles attach to the mandible and have a posterior direction of pull. Based on this, I think step-by-step about the muscles that could be responsible for pulling the mandible back. Genioglossus is a tongue muscle that attaches to the lingula of the mandible and has a posterior direction of pull. Therefore, it is likely to be involved in pulling the mandible back. Mylohyoid is another possibility as it is an intraoral muscle that attaches to the mylohyoid line on the medial aspect of the mandible. However, its direction of pull is not exclusively posterior. Masseter and thyrohyoid are muscles that do not attach directly to the mandible and have no obvious role in pulling it back.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
