["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents provided discuss various types of cancer and their metastatic routes. Oral cancer is not specifically mentioned, but we can draw parallels with other cancers. Axillary lymph nodes are mentioned as an occult site for breast cancer, which implies that lymphatics can be a route for metastasis. Similarly, ovarian cancer's discussion on whole abdominal irradiation after tumor removal suggests that lymphatics or bloodstream may be involved in metastasis. Neurosurgical intervention in central nervous system metastatic lesions does not provide specific information on the most common route of metastasis. However, it does mention blood vessels as a possible route. Direct extension is mentioned as an indication for neurosurgical intervention, but it's not directly related to oral cancer. Aspiration of tumor cells is not discussed in any of the provided documents. Based on these parallels and discussions, we can infer that lymphatics or bloodstream are likely routes for metastasis of oral cancer.\", \"answer_choice\": B}"]
