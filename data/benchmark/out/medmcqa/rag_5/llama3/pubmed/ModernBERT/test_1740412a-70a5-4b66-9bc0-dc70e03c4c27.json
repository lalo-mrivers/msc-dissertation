["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about features of reversible cell injury. We need to identify the characteristics that are unique to irreversible cell injury. In the provided documents, there is no specific information about dens deposition of mitochondria, detachment of ribosomes, or ER swelling. However, we can find information about the physical basics of computerized axial tomography in [Selected promising radiological imaging techniques (author's transl)]. Phonocardiography and CTG are also discussed in [A rare form of oscillation]. Myelography with Dimer-X is described in [Tolerance of dimer-X for lumbosacral myelography (author's transl)]. Emergency approach to fingertip injuries is presented in [Emergency approach to fingertip injuries]. Posttraumatic alterations demonstrated by isotope cisternography are discussed in [Posttraumatic alterations demonstrated by isotope cisternography (author's transl)].\n\nAfter careful consideration of the provided documents, we can conclude that dens deposition of mitochondria is not a feature of reversible cell injury. The other options, ER swelling, Bleb, and Detachment of ribosome, are all characteristics of reversible cell injury.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
