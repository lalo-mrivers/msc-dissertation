["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The provided documents are related to various medical topics such as articulator design, burn injuries, fetal weight estimation, and multiple-choice questions. None of these documents explicitly mention variables like height, weight, blood groups, or age. Therefore, we need to analyze the characteristics of these variables. Height in cms and Weight in kg are continuous variables that can take on any value within a certain range. Blood groups A, B, and ABO are categorical variables with distinct categories.

The option that is not a continuous variable is the correct answer.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"]
