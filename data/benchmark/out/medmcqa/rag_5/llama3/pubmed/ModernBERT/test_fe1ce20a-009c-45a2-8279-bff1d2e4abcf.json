["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for the number of patients with blood pressures between the 3rd and 4th quartile. The 1st quartile (Q1) is 94 mm Hg, and the 3rd quartile (Q3) is 110 mm Hg. This means that the interquartile range (IQR) is 110 - 94 = 16 mm Hg. The 4th quartile (Q4) would be Q1 + IQR, which is 94 + 16 = 110 mm Hg. Since we know the 3rd and 4th quartiles, we can calculate that the number of patients with blood pressures between these two values would be half the number of patients in the 3rd quartile (Q3). The problem does not provide the exact number of patients, but we can assume a reasonable value for the Q3, which is around 50-60% of the total. So, if we take 50 as the approximate Q3, then half of that would be 25.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A: 25\""]
