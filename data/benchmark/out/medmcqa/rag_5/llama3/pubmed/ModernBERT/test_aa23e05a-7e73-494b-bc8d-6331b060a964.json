["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the least likely complication of pregnancy-induced hypertension. Pregnancy-induced hypertension can be associated with various complications such as preeclampsia, HELLP syndrome, fetal macrosomia, and renal failure.\\r\\n\\r\\nPreeclampsia is a well-known complication of pregnancy-induced hypertension, so it cannot be the least likely one.\\r\\n\\r\\nHELLP syndrome is also a known complication of severe preeclampsia or eclampsia, so it's unlikely to be the least likely one as well.\\r\\n\\r\\nFetal macrosomia is a possibility in cases of uncontrolled diabetes or hypertension, but it's not exclusively related to pregnancy-induced hypertension, so it might be a less common complication.\\r\\n\\r\\nRenal failure is not typically associated with pregnancy-induced hypertension. While hypertension can lead to kidney damage and renal failure in the long run, this is not a direct complication of pregnancy-induced hypertension.\\r\\n\\r\\nBased on these considerations, I believe that Renal failure (A) is the least likely complication.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
