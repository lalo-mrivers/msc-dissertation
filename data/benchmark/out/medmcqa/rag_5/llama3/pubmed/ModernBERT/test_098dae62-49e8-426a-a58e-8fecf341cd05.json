["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"No relevant documents provide information about annealing. Therefore, it is necessary to look for general information about annealing. Annealing is a heat treatment process that involves heating the material to a certain temperature and then cooling it slowly. This process is used to relieve stresses in materials, such as metal or glass, after they have been subjected to mechanical stress. It can also be used to alter the properties of materials, such as their strength or ductility.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
