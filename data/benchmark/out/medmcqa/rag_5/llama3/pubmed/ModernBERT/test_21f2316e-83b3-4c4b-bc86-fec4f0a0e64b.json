["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about a syndrome characterized by 2X chromosomes and 1Y chromosome. From the provided documents, we can see that Down's syndrome is caused by an extra copy of chromosome 21 (trisomy 21), but this does not match the description of having 2X chromosomes and 1Y chromosome.
