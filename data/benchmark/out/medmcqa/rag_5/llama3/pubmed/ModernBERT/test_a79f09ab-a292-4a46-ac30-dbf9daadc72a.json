["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about a young man who developed weakness after 3 days on a high protein diet. The blood investigation revealed hypoglycemia. This suggests that the high protein diet may have interfered with glucose metabolism, leading to low blood sugar levels. The documents suggest that kwashiorkor (a condition characterized by severe malnutrition) can lead to hypoglycemia due to impaired glycogenolysis and low glucagon levels. Therefore, I will look for a document related to kwashiorkor or malnutrition. The relevant document is 'Hypoglycaemia associated with severe kwashiorkor'. This document suggests that glycogenolysis was impaired in severe kwashiorkor, which led to hypoglycemia. Glycogen phosphorylase is the enzyme responsible for glycogenolysis.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
