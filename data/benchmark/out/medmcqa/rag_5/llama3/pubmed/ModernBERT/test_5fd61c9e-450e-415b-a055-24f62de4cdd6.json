["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking what should not be done when planning a wider osteotomy. None of the options provided involve damaging or disrupting the surrounding bone tissue. The documents provide information on surgical procedures for various conditions, but none specifically mention wider osteotomy. However, we can infer that 'wider implant' and 'bone graft plus implant' are likely related to the insertion of an implant into a prepared site, which is not directly relevant to the question. Therefore, we can eliminate options B and C. The remaining options describe procedures that preserve or maintain surrounding bone tissue: pressing buccal and lingual plates (A) and deep osteotomy (D). Since the question asks what should not be done during wider osteotomy planning, it is likely that option D 'Deep osteotomy' is the correct answer as it would be an over-correction and may cause further complications.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
