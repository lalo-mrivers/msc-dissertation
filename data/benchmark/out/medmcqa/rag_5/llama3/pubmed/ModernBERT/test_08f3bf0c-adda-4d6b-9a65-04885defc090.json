["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the binding of mRNA with ribosome in prokaryotes. The provided documents are about cell-free systems of protein synthesis, lectin activity, nuclear restriction, telomere-binding activity, and protein synthesis during regeneration. However, none of these documents explicitly mention the binding of mRNA with ribosomes in prokaryotes. Therefore, we need to look at general knowledge about prokaryotic translation.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
