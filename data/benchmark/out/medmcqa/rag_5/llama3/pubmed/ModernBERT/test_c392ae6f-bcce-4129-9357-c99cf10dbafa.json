["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks which option is NOT true regarding iron supplementation in iron deficiency anemia. The documents provided don't directly address iron supplementation or iron deficiency anemia. However, we can analyze the options to identify the incorrect statement.\\nA: Administer a small diluted dose first prior to infusion to look for any allergy to iron preparation - This sounds like a reasonable approach to minimize potential allergic reactions.\\nB: Oral iron therapy should be stopped once the patient achieves a hemoglobin of >12 mg/dL - There's no specific guidance in the provided documents, but it's possible that this is a standard practice.\\nC: If gastric intolerance to oral iron therapy occurs, all patients should be administered parenteral forms - This option seems to suggest that parenteral forms are always necessary, which might not be true.\\nD: Parenteral iron supplementation is required in a patient with Hb of less than 7 mg/dL - The documents don't provide specific guidelines on hemoglobin levels, so this option could be incorrect.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
