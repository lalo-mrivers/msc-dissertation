["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the early fusion of the coronal suture. None of the provided documents mention anything about the coronal suture or skull development. Therefore, I will look at the potential choices to see if any of them are related to premature closure of the coronal suture. Brachycephaly and Scaphocephaly are both related to prematurely closed coronal sutures, with brachycephaly being a result of early fusion and scaphocephaly being a result of delayed or incomplete fusion. Trigonocephaly is not directly related to the coronal suture, but it can be caused by premature closure of other skull sutures. Oxycephaly is typically caused by complete fusion of the sagittal suture, which is different from the coronal suture. Based on this information, I believe that early fusion of the coronal suture results in Brachycephaly.\",\n\"answer_choice\": A"]
