["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about indirect ophthalmoscopy. The documents provided are about osteopathy, swallowing assessment, retrograde cardioplegia, pelvimetry, and home or hospital? There is no direct information about indirect ophthalmoscopy in these documents. However, we can look at the characteristics of indirect ophthalmoscopy to determine which option is false.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn general, indirect ophthalmoscopy uses a concave lens, not a convex one. It provides an inverted and reversed image, not erect. The magnification of indirect ophthalmoscopy is typically 2-3 times, not 4-5 times. And the image is usually dimly lit, not bright.\\r\\n\\r\\nTherefore, option D 'It is so bright that regular haziness is penetrated' is false about indirect ophthalmoscopy.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
