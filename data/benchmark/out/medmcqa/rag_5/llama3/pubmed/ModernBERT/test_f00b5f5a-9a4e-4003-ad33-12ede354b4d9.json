["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Tumor staging is based on the TNM system, where T represents the primary tumor's size and location, N represents the presence of lymph node involvement, and M represents the presence of distant metastasis. Based on this information, we can deduce that the given tumor is represented as T3N2M0. The 'T3' indicates that the tumor has penetrated deeply into the organ or has invaded nearby tissues, while the 'N2' shows lymph node involvement, and the 'M0' signifies no distant metastasis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
