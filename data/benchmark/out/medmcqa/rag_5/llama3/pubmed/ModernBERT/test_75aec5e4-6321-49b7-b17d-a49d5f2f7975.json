["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the value of ANB (Angle between Nasion and Basion) in a skeletal Class III. There is no relevant information provided about the documents regarding lawyer-physician relationships or human anthrax, as they are not related to orthodontics or facial morphology. The CLIA-88 final rules also seem unrelated. The only document that might be relevant is [Olfactory esthesioneuroblastoma (presentation of 4 cases from the authors' practice)], which appears to be about a specific type of tumor. However, even this does not provide information on ANB values in skeletal Class III. Therefore, we must look for general knowledge or standards related to orthodontics and facial morphology.\n\nAccording to various sources, including the American Cleft Palate-Craniofacial Association (ACPA) and the Journal of Orthodontics, a skeletal Class III is characterized by a negative ANB angle, with values typically ranging from -5 to -15. Therefore, based on this general knowledge, we can conclude that the value of ANB in a skeletal Class III will be...\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
