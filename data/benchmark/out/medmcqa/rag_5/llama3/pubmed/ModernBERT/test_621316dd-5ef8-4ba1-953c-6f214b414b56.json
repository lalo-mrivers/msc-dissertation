["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question describes a woman with 20 weeks pregnancy presenting with bleeding per vaginum. On speculum examination, the os is open but no products have come out yet. This suggests that there may be an issue related to miscarriage or abortion. The fact that the os is open and no products have been passed out rules out complete aboion. Inevitable aboion implies a spontaneous process that has started, which does not fit with the patient's symptoms. Missed aboion can also be ruled out since there are bleeding symptoms present. This leaves incomplete aboion as the most likely diagnosis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
