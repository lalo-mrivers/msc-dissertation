["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about RVG (Radiation View Graphics), which is not explicitly mentioned in the provided documents. However, I can use the information from 'Pelvimetry (author's transl)' to make an educated guess. The document discusses a simple and precise technique for pelvimetry that delivers only a low dose of irradiation. This suggests that RVG might be related to radiological imaging techniques. Based on this understanding, I will analyze the answer choices.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
