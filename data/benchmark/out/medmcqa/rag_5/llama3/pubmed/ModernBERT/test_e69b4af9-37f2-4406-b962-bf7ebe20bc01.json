["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the destruction of both bone and disc spaces. In the provided documents, there are mentions of bones (e.g., Ilizarov frame) but no mention of disc spaces. However, one document does discuss skeletal fixation in children, which could be related to bone spaces. There is also a technique described for drilling and wiring small bone fragments in awkward positions, which further supports the idea that bone spaces are being referred to. Given the focus on bones rather than disc spaces, I think the correct answer is related to bone destruction or a condition that affects bone.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
