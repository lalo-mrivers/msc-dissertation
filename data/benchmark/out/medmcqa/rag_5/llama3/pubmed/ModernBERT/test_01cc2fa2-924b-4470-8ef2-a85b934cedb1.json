["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the Judet view of X-ray. The relevant documents are a technical note on an X-ray screen/film combination and a pelvimetry technique that uses a lateral view for pelvis measurement, but with Fernstroem's AP view. There is no mention of Judet in these documents. However, a separate document mentions pelvimetry, which involves measuring the size of the pelvis. The Pelvimetry (author's transl) article describes a simple and precise technique for pelvimetry that delivers only a low dose of irradiation. This suggests that the Judet view is related to pelvimetry, specifically AP view.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
