["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the given documents, I found that bone resorption is mentioned in three places. The first document talks about blade implants showing a response in the bone representing a connective tissue suspension. The second document discusses bursal osteochondromatosis, which involves enchondral ossification and conversion of cartilage nodules to bone. The third document evaluates bone structure changes. Based on these findings, I think that endosteal bone formation is related to the process of enchondral ossification. As a result, I believe that the necrotising pressure areas undergoing bone resorption and endosteal bone formation are likely caused by osteoclastic lesions.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
