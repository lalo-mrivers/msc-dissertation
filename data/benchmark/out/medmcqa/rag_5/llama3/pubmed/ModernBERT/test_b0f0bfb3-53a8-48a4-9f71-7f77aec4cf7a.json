["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to understand what hepatic first-pass metabolism is. It's the process by which the liver metabolizes drugs before they reach the general circulation. Now, let's think about the different routes of administration and how each one might affect the liver's ability to perform first-pass metabolism. Oral administration would certainly involve the liver, so we can rule that out. Intravenous administration bypasses the digestive system and liver, so it's a good candidate for bypassing hepatic first-pass metabolism. Sublingual and intradermal administration both enter the bloodstream through non-oral routes, but they still need to pass through the liver before reaching the general circulation, so we can't be sure if they would completely bypass the liver's involvement. Therefore, based on our analysis of each route, we can conclude that oral is the only one that would not bypass hepatic first-pass metabolism.\", \"answer_choice\": A}"]
