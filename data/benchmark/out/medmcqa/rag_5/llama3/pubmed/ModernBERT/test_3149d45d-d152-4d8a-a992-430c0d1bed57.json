["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about factors that increase the number of patients required in a clinical trial. One relevant document is 'Allocation of patients to treatment groups in a controlled clinical study' which talks about patient selection criteria and how it affects the value of the results. This suggests that too stringent patient selection criteria could lead to an increased number of patients needed. Another relevant document is 'Too stringent patient selection criteria in a clinical trial of alpha-blockers reduce the value of the results' which explicitly states that too strict patient selection can limit the representativeness of the study population and thus require more patients.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C\n}"]
