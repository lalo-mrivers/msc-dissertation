["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks which drug can decrease the size of prostate. I will look at each option carefully. Tamsulosin is an alpha blocker used to treat BPH (Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia), but it doesn't specifically decrease the size of prostate. Sildenafil is a phosphodiesterase inhibitor used to treat erectile dysfunction and has no direct relation to prostate size. Prazosin, like tamsulosin, is an alpha blocker used to treat BPH, but again, it doesn't directly affect prostate size. Finasteride is a 5-alpha-reductase inhibitor used to treat BPH by shrinking the prostate, which makes it the most relevant option. Therefore, I will choose Finasteride as the answer.\", \"answer_choice\": C}"]
