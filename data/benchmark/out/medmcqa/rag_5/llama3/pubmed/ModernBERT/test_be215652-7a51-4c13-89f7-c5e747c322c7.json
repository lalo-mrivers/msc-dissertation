["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the difference between mandibular and maxillary premolars. Upon reviewing the provided documents, we find that there is no explicit information comparing the two types of premolars. However, we can look for relevant descriptions in the documents. In 'Oral surgery in general dental practice', there is a mention of malpositioned premolars and canines, but it does not specify any differences between mandibular and maxillary premolars. Similarly, in 'Craniofacial pattern of Class III deciduous dentition', there are cephalometric analyses of children with different occlusions, but no specific information about premolar morphology. In the other documents, there is no relevant information. Therefore, we must rely on general dental knowledge to answer this question. Mandibular and maxillary premolars have distinct morphological features. For instance, mandibular premolars tend to have a more prominent buccal surface than maxillary premolars.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
