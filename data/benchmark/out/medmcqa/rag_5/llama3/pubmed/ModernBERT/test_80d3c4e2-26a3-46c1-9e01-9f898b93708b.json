["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the purpose of an incision 2 cm below the border of mandible in submandibular surgery. The relevant documents mention sagittal osteotomy of the ramus and reconstruction of the central mandible, but these do not directly relate to the incision. However, another document describes a lateral lip flap with a perialar extension for reconstructing defects of the upper lip which extend into the columella and/or the nostril floor. This does not seem relevant to submandibular surgery either. The remaining option is to analyze the surgical anatomy of the mandible. In this case, the marginal mandibular nerve is located just below the border of the mandible. Therefore, an incision 2 cm below the border would preserve this nerve.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
