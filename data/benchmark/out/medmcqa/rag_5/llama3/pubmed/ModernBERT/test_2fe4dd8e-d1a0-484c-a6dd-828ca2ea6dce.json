["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"This question is asking about the sensory nerve supply of the capsule of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ). The relevant documents do not directly mention the TMJ or its capsule. However, one document does describe a fine-tipped bipolar nerve-stimulator probe being used in intracranial surgery of the cranial nerves. This suggests that the auriculotemporal nerve, which is involved in the sensory innervation of the TMJ, may be relevant to this question. A search through the documents reveals no mention of the facial or massetric nerves, and the auricular nerve appears to be related to the ear rather than the TMJ.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
