["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on my knowledge of chemistry, I can infer that cross-linking is a process that creates chemical bonds between polymer chains. In the context of resins, this process improves the physical properties of the material. From the given options, I can see that strength, hardness, and crazing resistance are all related to the mechanical properties of the resin. Therefore, I conclude that cross-linking in resins helps increasing A: Strength.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
