["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the major mechanism of transport of drugs across biological membranes. The provided documents discuss various topics such as restricted diffusion in photosynthetic membranes, plant membrane transport, mixed micelles in drug delivery, gliding edge dislocations in proteins as a mechanism for active ion transport, and a fluid mechanical hypothesis for macromolecular transport in living cells. None of these documents directly mention the major mechanism of transport of drugs across biological membranes. However, we can infer that passive diffusion could be a possible answer since it is a common method of transport of molecules across cell membranes.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
