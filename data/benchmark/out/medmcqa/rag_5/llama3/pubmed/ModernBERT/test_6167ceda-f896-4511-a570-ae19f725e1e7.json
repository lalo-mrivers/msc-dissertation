["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"No relevant documents mention glucagon's effect on lipase. However, one document talks about pancreatic hydrolase activity in response to hydrocortisone. This suggests that the focus is on pancreatic enzymes. Another document discusses insulin and adrenaline's effects on glucose utilization in Tetrahymena. Glucagon is not mentioned. The only relevant information is the mention of pancreas and enzymes, which makes me think about pancreatic lipase. None of the provided choices are explicitly linked to glucagon, but B: Hormone-sensitive lipase seems a plausible answer.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
