["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Since the provided documents do not mention Isoflurane's maximum dose of adrenaline, we need to look for relevant information about Isoflurane. In the 'Advantages and guidelines for mask induction' document, it is mentioned that inhalational agents with low blood/gas solubilities (like halothane and isoflurane) are preferred for mask induction. This suggests that Isoflurane is an option for general anesthesia. However, there is no specific information provided about the maximum dose of adrenaline when using Isoflurane as a general anesthetic agent.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
