["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"There are no relevant documents that mention the pulp or dental tissues. However, we can look for information about the single layer outlining the pulp. The 'area striata' mentioned in one of the documents refers to a specific layer in the human brain, and it's unlikely related to the topic at hand.

This is because ameloblasts are found in the single layer outlining the pulp of teeth, specifically in the outermost zone of the pulp.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
