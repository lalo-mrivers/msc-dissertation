["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The document 'The facial reflex of allergy' describes the facial reflex test which assesses the relative irritability of muscle tissue (cardic, smooth, skeletal) and the effect of certain drugs. The document does not specifically mention lg levels in chronic allergy. However, I can cross-check with other documents that are relevant to allergy. For instance, 'Unilateral rampant caries' does not seem to be related to lg levels either. Similarly, 'Surgeons failure to recognize syphilis' and 'Summer and skin' do not provide any information about lg levels in chronic allergy. The only document that might have a connection is 'Ether cystitis'. However, after re-reading the text, I did not find any mention of lg levels either. Therefore, based on my step-by-step thinking, I will rely solely on the first document, 'The facial reflex of allergy', to answer this question.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
