["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"After reviewing the provided documents, none of them appear to be directly related to glucocorticoid deficiency or its features. However, I can use my general medical knowledge to approach this question. Glucocorticoid deficiency is a condition characterized by impaired production or action of cortisol, a hormone produced by the adrenal gland. It can manifest with symptoms such as fatigue, weight loss, and decreased resistance to infection.\n\nBased on this understanding, I will review the options provided:\n\nA: Fever - This is a common symptom of glucocorticoid deficiency, so it is not an exception.\nB: Hyperkalemia - This is not typically a feature of glucocorticoid deficiency. In fact, hyperkalemia (high potassium levels) can be caused by other conditions, such as kidney disease or cardiac problems.\nC: Postural hypotension - This is not related to glucocorticoid deficiency. Postural hypotension refers to a sudden drop in blood pressure when standing up, and it has no direct connection to cortisol production or action.\nD: Weight loss - Weight loss can be a feature of glucocorticoid deficiency, as mentioned earlier. So, this option is not an exception.\n\nBased on my step-by-step thinking, I conclude that the correct answer is B: Hyperkalemia.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
