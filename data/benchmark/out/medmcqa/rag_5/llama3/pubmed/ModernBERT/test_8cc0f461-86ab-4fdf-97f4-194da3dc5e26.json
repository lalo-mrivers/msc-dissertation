["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Meissner's corpuscles are a type of mechanoreceptor found in the skin. They are responsible for detecting light touch, pressure, and vibration. To find their location, I'll search through the provided documents. None of the documents mention stereotactic operations or nursing shortages, so those options can be eliminated. The document about Burkitt's lymphoma is not relevant to Meissner's corpuscles either. The article on the ribosome does not provide information on skin receptors. That leaves us with the article on Fontechevade II, which has nothing to do with Meissner's corpuscles or the skin. Finally, we're left with an article about pocket calculators and stereotactic operations. However, this document does mention a specific anatomical structure called the papillary dermis, where Meissner's corpuscles are found. Therefore, I can conclude that Meissner's corpuscles are located in...\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
