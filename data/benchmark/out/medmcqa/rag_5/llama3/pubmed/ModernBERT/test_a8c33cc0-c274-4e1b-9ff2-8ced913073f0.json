["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant document provided is '[Alginate with a chlorhexidine admixture in a torsion test]', which discusses the elastic properties of commercial alginate impression materials. The study concludes that the elastic properties are not essentially influenced by chlorhexidin at microbiologically effective concentration. This suggests that alginate impression material does not have any significant changes in terms of its gelation, mixing time, deformation during removal, or re-usability when compared to agar-agar impression material. Therefore, the correct answer should reflect a characteristic common to both materials.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
