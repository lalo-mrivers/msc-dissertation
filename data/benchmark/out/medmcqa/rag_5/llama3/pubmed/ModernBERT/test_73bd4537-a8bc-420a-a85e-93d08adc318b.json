["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The provided documents do not specifically mention myelography or the expansion of a contrast-filled space. However, we can rule out options B and C as they are related to tumors or anomalies which do not typically cause an expansion of the space in myelography. Option D refers to extradural tumors which could potentially cause compression or displacement of spinal structures but is not directly related to the expansion of the space. Therefore, it's likely that the correct answer is related to intramedullary pathology. This leads us to option A, Intramedullary tumor, as a possible explanation for the expansion of the contrast-filled space in myelography.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
