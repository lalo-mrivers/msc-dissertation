["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the modulus of elasticity for supporting complex amalgam restoration. We know that stress induced in an amalgam restoration increases at least threefold with a zinc oxide-eugenol (ZOE) base compared to a ZnPO4 cement base. This suggests that ZOE has a lower modulus of elasticity than ZnPO4, which is important for supporting complex amalgam restorations.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
