["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, we need to determine what SD plasma refers to. Based on the provided documents, SD plasma is a type of plasma that has been mobilized by a plasma protein mobilizing factor (PPMF) in response to hemorrhage (A plasma protein mobilizing factor in dogs following hemorrhage). This PPMF releases a chemical mediator into the blood during hypoproteinemia, which helps restore plasma protein levels. Since SD plasma is related to this process, it's likely that it has antiviral properties, as demonstrated by Evirkhip's marked antiviral activity (The determination of the antiviral activity of the sorbent Evirkhip (in vitro studies)). Given these clues, we can infer that SD plasma destroys lipid-enveloped viruses. Among the options, HBV is a lipid-enveloped virus, making it the most likely possibility for infection after transfusion.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
