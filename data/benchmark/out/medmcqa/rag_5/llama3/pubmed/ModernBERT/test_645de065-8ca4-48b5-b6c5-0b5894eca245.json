["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Since the question is asking about essential fatty acids present in breast milk that are required for normal growth of a child, we can start by looking at the relevant documents. We have [Hormones in milk] which discusses various hormones and tissue growth factors in milk during different stages of lactation, but it doesn't specifically mention essential fatty acids. We also have Epidermal growth factor: an important constituent of human milk which talks about epidermal growth factor being a human milk mitogen that promotes growth and maturation of infant intestinal mucosa, but again no mention of essential fatty acids. Metabolic changes induced by human growth hormone discusses the effects of human growth hormone on various metabolic processes, but still no information on essential fatty acids. Amino acid nutrition of the fetal lamb talks about amino acid retention in the fetal lamb from maternal circulation, which might be relevant, and Amniotic fluid phospholipids and fatty acids in normal pregnancies discusses the composition of amniotic fluid and its relation to gestational age and neonatal condition. The document mentions palmitic acid as an index of gestational age, but we're looking for essential fatty acids required for normal growth of a child. Docosahexanoic acid (DHA) is known to be an essential fatty acid important for brain development in infants, so it's possible that it might be present in breast milk. Linoleic acid is also an essential fatty acid, but there isn't enough information in these documents to confirm its presence in breast milk or its importance for normal growth of a child. EPA is another type of omega-3 fatty acid, and although DHA is more commonly associated with brain development, EPA is also important for infant health.\", \"answer_choice\": B}"]
