["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the range for a 90% confidence interval, we need to find the critical t-value from a t-distribution table. The average GFR is 85 ml/min with a standard deviation of 25. Since this is a one-sample problem, we'll use a one-sample t-test. With a sample size of 100 and an unknown population mean, we can't assume normality. Therefore, we'll use the Welch's t-test.\n\nFor a 90% confidence interval, the critical t-value from a t-distribution table with 99 degrees of freedom (n-1) is approximately 1.65. We then add and subtract this value from the mean to get the upper and lower limits of the confidence interval.\n\nThe calculation would be: 85 ± 1.65 \\* (25 / √100) = 85 ± 6.45.\n\nThis means the range for a 90% confidence interval is between 78.55 and 91.45.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
