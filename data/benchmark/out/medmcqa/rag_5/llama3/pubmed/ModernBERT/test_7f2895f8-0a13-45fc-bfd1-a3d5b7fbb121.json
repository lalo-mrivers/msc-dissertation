["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about a pediatric patient with 45 minutes of continuous convulsions, and the IV line cannot be secured. The initial instruction was to give iv lorazepam, but that's not possible. I need to look for alternative routes of administration. The documents provided are mostly unrelated to pediatrics or convulsive seizures, except for [A thousand obstetrical sutures of the perineum using a slow absorption synthetic suture material (author's transl)], which mentions the use of a synthetic suture material in obstetrics. However, there is another document that caught my attention - [Advances in sphygmomanometry (author's transl)]. Although it's about blood pressure measurement, one of the issues mentioned is IV cannulation difficulties. This makes me think of potential alternative routes for medication administration. The only relevant option is rectal diazepam, which can be used as a substitute when IV access is not possible.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
