["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the properties of dopamine that are not helpful in acute shock. The first option, alpha-1 agonist action leading to peripheral vasoconstriction, could actually be beneficial in acute shock by increasing blood pressure. The second option, increase in renal perfusion due to agonist action on DI receptors, also seems like a positive effect. Option C, releasing noradrenaline and causing a positive inotropic effect, is also likely beneficial. This leaves us with option D, direct action on heart beta-1 receptors.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
