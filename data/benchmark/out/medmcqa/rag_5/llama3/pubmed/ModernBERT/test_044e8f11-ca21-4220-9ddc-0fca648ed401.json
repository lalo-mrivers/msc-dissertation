["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the active principle of white oleander. There are no relevant documents related to white oleander or its pharmacology. Therefore, we need to look for another connection. Upon reviewing the documents, we find that there is a mention of Nerin in one of them. It is mentioned in 'Autolok band...' as a type of braided polyester band. This seems unrelated to the question at hand, but it gives us a hint to search further.
