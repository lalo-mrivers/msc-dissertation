["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about investigating biliary atresia in a 2-month-old child. There are no documents related to this specific topic, but we can look for relevant information. The closest document is 'Rentrolental fibroplasia in a full-term infant.' which mentions indirect ophthalmoscopy as a way to document retrolental fibroplasia. This suggests that USG (ultrasound) could be useful in diagnosing biliary atresia. Additionally, Hepatic scintigraphy and ERCP are not commonly used for this age group or diagnosis. CT scan is not mentioned in any of the provided documents. Therefore, based on the available information, it seems most likely that USG would be the investigation of choice.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
