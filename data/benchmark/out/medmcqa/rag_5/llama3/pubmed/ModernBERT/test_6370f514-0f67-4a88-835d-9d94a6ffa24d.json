["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the most common pathognomonic sign of mandibular fracture. Among the provided documents, there are two that mention the mandible: [About the face value of the cleft of the articulus mandibulae] and Non-union of fractures of the clavicle. The first document talks about the planimetry of negative replicas on the mandibular joints, which seems unrelated to pathognomonic signs of fracture. The second document only mentions non-union of fractures of the clavicle, not the mandible. Therefore, it's unlikely that this document will provide information about pathognomonic signs of mandibular fracture. No other documents mention the mandible or fractures. Therefore, we need to rely on general medical knowledge and common symptoms associated with mandibular fractures.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"]
