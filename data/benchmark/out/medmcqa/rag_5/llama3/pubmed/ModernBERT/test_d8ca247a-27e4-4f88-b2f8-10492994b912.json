["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about what is typically associated with the loss of 40% of the circulating blood volume. The relevant documents provided are studies on intestinal obstruction, renal hypertension, alcohol-induced hypoglycemia, and changes in cholesterol esterification ratio during parenteral feeding. None of these studies directly address the topic of losing 40% of the circulating blood volume. However, we can look at how the body responds to significant blood loss. For example, the Regional redistributions of the blood in high and low small intestine obstruction study suggests that there is a considerable shift in electrolytic blood content but no change in total amount of circulating blood compared to control. This implies that the body may not significantly change its overall circulation volume in response to a 40% loss.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
