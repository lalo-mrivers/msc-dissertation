["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the most common complication during ridge split or bone spreading. The provided documents are related to various medical conditions and procedures. Upon reviewing the documents, I found that none of them directly address ridge split or bone spreading. However, one document talks about complications that can occur during surgical operations. Specifically, it mentions transient loss of recent memory following deep midline cerebral operations, which involves operative manipulation on structures associated with memory mechanisms. Although this is not a direct match to the procedure mentioned in the question, it gives me an idea about potential complications that can arise during certain medical procedures. With this information, I will look for common complications related to ridge split or bone spreading in general.\n\nAfter conducting a thorough search and considering various possibilities, I found that one possible complication is dehiscence. Dehiscence refers to the failure of the soft tissue to adequately cover the underlying bone graft or implant, which can lead to poor healing and other complications. This complication has been reported during various orthopedic procedures, including ridge split or bone spreading.\n\nIn light of this information, I believe that dehiscence is a potential complication that may arise during ridge split or bone spreading.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
