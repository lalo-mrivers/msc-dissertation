["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the extensive cross-linking of blood clot. From the provided documents, it can be inferred that this cross-linking is related to the formation of a stable clot. The document 'Cross-linked surface Ig attaches to actin' talks about cross-linking of surface Ig by the capping and patching phenomenon, which induces a specific association between surface Ig and cellular actin. This suggests that cross-linking can occur in blood clots as well. However, there is no direct mention of this process in the provided documents. Nonetheless, it can be inferred that cross-linking is crucial for clot stability. Among the given options, Factor XIII is known to facilitate the cross-linking of fibrin strands, thereby stabilizing the blood clot. Therefore, it is likely that extensive cross-linking occurs through Factor XIII.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
