["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about a variation involving 99.73%. This is likely referring to the Z-score or Standard Score (SD). The value 99.73% corresponds to approximately 3 standard deviations from the mean, since the area under the normal curve beyond ±1 SD is roughly 0.6827, and beyond ±2 SD it's about 0.9545. Beyond ±3 SD, the probability is very low, around 0.135%. So, we can deduce that this variation involves 3 Standard Deviations.\", \"answer_choice\": C}"]
