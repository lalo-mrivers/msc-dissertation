["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the composition of model plaster (white) used to cast study models before mixing with water. Upon reviewing the provided documents, there is no direct mention of model plaster or its composition. However, one document discusses dental casting and wax pattern preparation, but it does not specify the composition of model plaster.\\nIn another document, a retinal detachment band is discussed, which is unrelated to model plaster. The remaining documents focus on various medical instruments and techniques, none of which provide information about model plaster's composition. Therefore, we must consider general knowledge about dental materials.\\nModel plaster (also known as investment) is a mixture of gypsum-based compounds. CaSO4 • ½H2O is the most common form of calcium sulfate, which is often used in dental casting investments.\\nBased on this information and general knowledge about dental materials, we can conclude that model plaster is likely composed mainly of CaSO4 • ½H2O.\", \"answer_choice\": C}"]
