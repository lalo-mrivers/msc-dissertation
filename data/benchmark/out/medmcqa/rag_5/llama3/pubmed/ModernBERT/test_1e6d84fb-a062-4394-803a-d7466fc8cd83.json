["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the percentage of phosphoric acid where dicalcium phosphate monohydrate is formed that cannot be rinsed off. The relevant document is [Automatic determination of urinary mineral phosphate by centrifugation analysis]. According to this document, urinary phosphate with acid vanadate and molybdate induces a yellow coloration. This suggests that phosphoric acid is present in the context of urine. There is no information about dicalcium phosphate monohydrate formation or rinsing off in this document. Therefore, we need to look at other documents. The document [Solubilization of unconjugated bilirubin by bile salts] does not seem relevant either. We also do not have any information about sheep's blood acid-base equilibrium. The remaining document is [Synthesis of a water-soluble orotic acid salt]. This document describes the synthesis of thiaminedisulfide-monoorotate, but it does not mention phosphoric acid or dicalcium phosphate monohydrate either. Finally, we have the document [Effect of the overload of Sr++ and Ba++ on the association of Ca+, Mg++ and Pi with total proteins]. This document describes the effect of strontium and barium overload on calcium, magnesium, and inorganic phosphate. It does not mention dicalcium phosphate monohydrate or rinsing off either. As a result, we need to look at other sources or context outside these documents to answer this question.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
