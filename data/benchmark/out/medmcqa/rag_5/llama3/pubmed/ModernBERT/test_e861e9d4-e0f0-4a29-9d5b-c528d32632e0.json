["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the concentration of triple antibiotic paste (TAP) in treatment of revascularisation. None of the provided documents mention TAP or its use in treating revascularisation. However, the documents do discuss antibiotics and their application in various medical contexts. The document '[Modification of the microbial flora in the root canal]' mentions the use of Nebacetin solution as a medicamentous treatment for influencing germ flora, but does not specifically mention TAP. The other documents discuss urokinase, heparin, and antimicrobial dosage in renal failure, but do not provide information on TAP or its concentration.\n\nTherefore, based on the provided information, it is not possible to determine the concentration of TAP in treatment of revascularisation with certainty. However, it can be concluded that TAP is not a well-known or commonly used medication for this purpose.\", \"answer_choice\": \"None of the above\"}"]
