["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the politician who was shot in the back at the level of T8 vertebral. After the injury, he loses sensation below the level of lesion. We need to find the reason why the injured nerve cannot regenerate.\n\nFirstly, we should rule out the possibility that it's due to the presence of glial scar because it is a common complication after spinal cord injuries and does not necessarily preclude regeneration (as seen in [Grave cranio-cerebral trauma 30 years ago as cause of the brain glioma at the locus of the trauma particulars of the case].).\n\nNext, we should consider whether there are any growth factors present or endoneural tubes available for regeneration. However, since the injury is recent, it's unlikely that significant fibrosis has occurred to prevent regeneration.\n\nLastly, we should look into the possibility of a lack of myelin inhibiting substance or endoneural tubes. Myelin inhibiting substances have been shown to play a role in preventing axonal regrowth after spinal cord injuries (as seen in [Critical notes on the transport of patients with cervical spinal cord injuries]). Lack of these substances could hinder regeneration.\n\nThe reason why the injured nerve cannot regenerate is likely due to the presence of myelin inhibiting substance.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
