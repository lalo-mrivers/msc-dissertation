["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for a type of skin carcinoma that spreads by local invasion and has no tendency to metastasise. From the provided documents, it's clear that lung epidermoid carcinoma tends to invade locally but rarely presents with pre-sternal tumoration produced by local invasion as one of its manifestations. This suggests that lung epidermoid carcinoma is not the answer because it can metastasize. Similarly, leukotic spread and retrograde lymphatic spread are both forms of metastasis, so they cannot be the correct answer either. Cancer cell invasion and metastasis specifically highlights the importance of understanding how cancer cells invade tissues, which supports the idea that this type of skin carcinoma does not metastasise. Nail bed carcinoma is a rare condition that can only be diagnosed by biopsy, but it doesn't provide any information about its tendency to metastasise or spread by local invasion. Based on the provided documents and information, Basal cell carcinoma is the most likely answer because it tends to invade locally and has no significant tendency to metastasise.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
