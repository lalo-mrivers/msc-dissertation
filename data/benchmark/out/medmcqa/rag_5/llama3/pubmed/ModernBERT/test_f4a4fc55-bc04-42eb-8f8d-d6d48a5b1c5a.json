["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks for the strain that is NOT included in the trivalent influenza vaccine. Reviewing the provided documents, we see that H3N2 is a common strain mentioned (Clinical trials with intranasally administered WRL 105 strain live influenza vaccine in volunteers). Influenza B is also mentioned as one of the strains that could cause Guillain-Barr√© syndrome (Review of existing vaccines for influenza). However, H1N1 and H2N1 are not explicitly mentioned. Therefore, we can conclude that either H1N1 or H2N1 is the strain NOT included in the trivalent influenza vaccine.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C\n}"]
