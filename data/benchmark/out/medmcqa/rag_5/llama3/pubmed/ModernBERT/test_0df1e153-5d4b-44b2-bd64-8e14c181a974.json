["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about MHC antigens which are Major Histocompatibility Complex antigens. Since the provided documents do not explicitly mention MHC antigens, I will look for related information that can help me answer the question. The document 'Suppressor T cells: some answers but more questions' mentions suppressor T cells and antigen-binding factors, which are relevant to the immune system and MHC antigens. However, it does not provide direct information on where MHC antigens are absent. The other documents discuss different topics such as genetic markers, Rh antigens, and bacterial mutation rates, which do not help in answering this question. Therefore, I will rely on general knowledge about MHC antigens to answer the question.\", \"answer_choice\": B}"]
