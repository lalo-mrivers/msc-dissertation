["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the properties of polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA). The first thing to do is to look for relevant information in the provided documents. None of the given documents specifically discuss PMMA, so we need to focus on general materials properties that might be applicable. One thing to note is that PMMA is a type of acrylic plastic, which has some common characteristics. For example, it's known for being heat-resistant and having high tensile strength.\n\nLooking at the options, A mentions KHN (Knoop Hardness Number) 18-20, which is a measure of a material's hardness. This doesn't seem directly related to PMMA, so let's move on.\n\nOption B claims that PMMA is chemically stable if heated until 260 degree F. While this could be true, it would require further investigation into the thermal properties of PMMA. The provided documents don't provide direct evidence for or against this claim.\n\nOptions C and D both mention specific mechanical properties: modulus of elasticity (2.4 GPa) and tensile strength (29 MPa), respectively. However, these values seem unusually high for a plastic like PMMA, which typically has lower moduli and strengths.\n\nBased on this analysis, it seems that option B might be the correct answer, as it's the only one that mentions a specific temperature-related property of PMMA. However, we need to consider other possibilities.\", \"answer_choice\": D}"]
