["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents provided do not mention reamers or files with specific details about their physical characteristics. However, we can analyze the documents to see if there are any clues that could help us answer this question. The first document is about retention with lutes, which does not seem relevant. The second document is about dimensional accuracy of small gold alloy castings, but it only talks about investments and not reamers or files. The third document is a master plan for rebuilding something, which is also unrelated to the physical characteristics of reamers or files. The fourth document is about evaluating endodontic instruments, but again, it does not provide any information about their physical characteristics. Finally, the fifth document is about the correlation between dimensional changes of casting investments and the accuracy of fit of schematic crown rings, which is also unrelated to our question.\n\nThe only conclusion we can draw from these documents is that none of them mention reamers or files with specific details about their physical characteristics. This means that we have to rely on general knowledge or external sources to answer this question. Unfortunately, the provided options do not seem to be based on any information from the given documents.\", \n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
