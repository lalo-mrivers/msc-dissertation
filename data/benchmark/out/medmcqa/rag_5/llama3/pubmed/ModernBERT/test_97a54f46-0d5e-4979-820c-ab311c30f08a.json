["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the effect of exercise on end systolic volume. We have documents related to cardiac dynamics during work load. Let's see if we can find any information there. In 'Cardiac dynamics during the work load as studied by polycardiography', it mentions changes in systolic time intervals during the work load, but nothing specific about end systolic volume. However, another relevant document is '[Oxygen concentration, perfusion rate and cardiac oxygen consumption]', which talks about cardiac oxygen consumption not depending on oxygen contents in the perfusate, but rather on the perfusion velocity as a physical factor. This suggests that the heart's function may be influenced by physical factors during exercise, including changes in end systolic volume.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
