["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The buccinator muscle is a thin muscle that covers the cheek. It has an important role in facial expression and also helps to facilitate mastication by compressing the cheek against the teeth. The muscle receives motor innervation from the mandibular branch of the facial nerve, not directly pierced by any of the mentioned options. The Parotid duct is a structure that passes through the buccinator, but does not pierce it. The buccal branch of the trigeminal nerve and the labial branch of the facial nerve are both sensory nerves that innervate the cheek and lips respectively, but do not pierce the buccinator muscle. Molar mucous glands are located in the cheek and are not related to the piercing of the buccinator.\",\n\"answer_choice\": A"]
