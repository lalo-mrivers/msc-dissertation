["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the relevant documents, we can see that one of them is about 'Detection of bityrosine in cataractous human lens protein'. This document mentions the isolation of a compound called bityrosine from the insoluble protein of human cataractous lenses. It also suggests that this compound may form cross-links with polypeptide chains, causing significant alteration in native protein structure. Given the context of the question and the content of the relevant documents, it is likely that the high molecular weight proteins mentioned are related to cataractous lens. Therefore, we can infer that the answer is about proteins found only in human cataracts.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
