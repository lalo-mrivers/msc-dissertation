["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks which sensation is NOT perceived by the spinal nucleus of the trigeminal nerve. This suggests that we need to look for information on the functions or sensations associated with this nerve. From the provided documents, none of them directly address the function of the trigeminal nerve. However, document [The large somatosensory evoked responses (author's transl)] discusses giant cerebral evoked potentials in cases of brain stem tumor and hydrocephaly, which suggests that the trigeminal nerve may be involved in processing somatosensory information, such as touch or pain. Documents [Reflex mechanism for maintaining magnesium homeostasis] and [Response of efferent vestibular fibers to horizontal rotation in frogs (Rana esculenta L.)] discuss reflex mechanisms and vestibular responses, which do not seem directly relevant to the question. Therefore, we can conclude that the spinal nucleus of the trigeminal nerve likely perceives touch and pain.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
