["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Since the question is asking about infective endocarditis being least common in a specific condition, I will look for relevant information in the provided documents. None of the given documents seem to directly relate to infective endocarditis or its prevalence in different heart conditions. However, one document does mention Streptococcal pancarditis which is an unusual association of pancarditis due to Streptococcus viridans. This suggests that certain types of streptococci can cause endocarditis. With this information, I will consider the options and eliminate any that are directly related to endocarditis or carditis. Mitral stenosis and Aortic stenosis both relate to valvular disease which could be associated with infective endocarditis. VSD and ASD are congenital heart defects that may also have a higher risk of developing infective endocarditis due to the presence of shunts.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
