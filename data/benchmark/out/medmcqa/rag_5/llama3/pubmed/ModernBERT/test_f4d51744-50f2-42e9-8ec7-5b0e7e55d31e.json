["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Firstly, we need to identify the characteristic signs of tension pneumothorax. A steering wheel injury to the right side of chest is likely to cause a left-sided pneumothorax. We also know that the patient presents with breathlessness and shock. Secondly, a cardiac tamponade would present with decreased pulse pressure, not increased as seen in this case. The jugular venous pressure (JVP) would be elevated in both cases but is less specific. Breath sounds on the affected side are typically absent or decreased in tension pneumothorax and decreased in cardiac tamponade. Heart sounds may be muffled in both cases, but more so in cardiac tamponade due to pericardial fluid compressing the heart.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"]
