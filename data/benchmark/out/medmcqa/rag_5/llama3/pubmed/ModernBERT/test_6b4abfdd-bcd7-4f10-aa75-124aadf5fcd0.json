["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine how many divisions to fill, we need to calculate the total amount of ceftriaxone needed (180 mg) relative to the concentration of ceftriaxone in the solution (500 mg/5ml). Since there are 10 divisions per ml on the syringe, each division represents 0.1 ml or 50 mg. To get 180 mg, we need 3.6 times the amount of a single division (180 / 50 = 3.6), which is equivalent to 36. We'll round up to 37, since you can't fill a fraction of a division.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
