["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the Curve of occlusion touching the buccal and lingual surfaces of mandibular buccal cuspal teeth. The provided documents do not directly mention the specific types of curves related to occlusion. However, one document mentions 'displaced dentition' due to altered dento-facial proportions, which is relevant to this question. Another document describes a technique for mobilizing and repositioning mandibular posterior alveolar segments. These segments can be extruded or impacted, tipped bucally or lingually, or can be uprighted. This suggests that the Curve of occlusion could be related to the buccal and lingual surfaces of mandibular buccal cuspal teeth.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
