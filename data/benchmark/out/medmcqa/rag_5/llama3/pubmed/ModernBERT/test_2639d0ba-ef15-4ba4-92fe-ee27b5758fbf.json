["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"After reviewing the provided documents, I did not find any information related to SABE prophylaxis. However, based on my knowledge as a medical expert, SABE stands for Sternotomy and Aortic Bypass Endarterectomy, which is a type of cardiovascular surgery. Considering the options provided, it seems that CABG (Coronary Artery Bypass Graft) is a type of cardiovascular surgery that may or may not require SABE prophylaxis. The other options, MR (Mitral Regurgitation), ASD (Atrial Septal Defect), and MS (Mitral Stenosis), are all congenital heart defects or valvular diseases that do not typically involve bypass grafting.\n\nTherefore, I believe the correct answer is D: CABG.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
