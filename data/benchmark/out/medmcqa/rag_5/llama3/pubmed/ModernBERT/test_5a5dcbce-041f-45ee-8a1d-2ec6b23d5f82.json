["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has steroid-dependent nephrotic syndrome for the last 5 years. The patient is cushingoid with blood pressure of 120/86 mmHg and small subcapsular cataracts. This suggests that the patient may be at risk for complications related to chronic steroid use, such as glaucoma or cataract formation. Therefore, we should consider alternative treatments to steroids. Cyclophosphamide is often used in patients with nephrotic syndrome who are resistant to steroids. Frusemide and enalapril are diuretics that may be useful in managing fluid overload associated with nephrotic syndrome, but they do not address the underlying condition. Intravenous immunoglobulin has been reported as effective in some cases of idiopathic membranous nephropathy, but there is no evidence to support its use in steroid-dependent nephrotic syndrome.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B: Cyclophosphamide\"\n}"]
