["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has abdominal pain and altered bowel habits for 6 months. The CT examination shows dilated distal pa of ileum, thickened ileocecal junction with thickened cecum, sacculations on the antimesenteric border, and increased vascularity of adjoining mesentery with surrounding fat. Considering these findings, a diagnosis of Crohn's disease is likely due to the characteristics of the CT scan. The differential diagnoses are primarily related to inflammatory bowel diseases.
