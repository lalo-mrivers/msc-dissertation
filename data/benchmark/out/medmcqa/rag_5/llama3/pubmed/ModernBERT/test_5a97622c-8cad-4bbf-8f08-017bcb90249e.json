["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"No relevant documents mention odontogenic keratocyst. However, one document discusses bone formation in a periosteal graft used to anchor a Cardona keratoprosthesis, which is different from an odontogenic keratocyst.

Based on this information, it can be concluded that none of the provided documents have any direct relevance to odontogenic keratocysts.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
