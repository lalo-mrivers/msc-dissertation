["{\n    \"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the development of the 2nd mandibular molar at 12 years of age. We need to know when the root formation starts and ends for this tooth. According to the document 'Crown component variation in the hominoid lower second premolar', crown component measurements illustrate a great increase in retrieval of morphological information over the more conventional measurements of maximum dental length and breadth. This suggests that the development of the molar follows a specific pattern. The document does not provide a direct answer to the question, but we can infer the answer based on the general knowledge about dental development. The 2nd mandibular molar typically starts forming its roots around 8-10 years of age and completes root formation by around 12-14 years of age.\",\n    \"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
