["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant document is 'The effect of alloy composition on the development of internal porosity in cast structures.' This study discusses how chromium is used in alloys. In particular, it mentions a 'simple nickel-chromium alloy'. This implies that chromium is added to this alloy for its properties. Since stainless steel contains chromium, we can assume that chromium provides a similar benefit in stainless steel.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
