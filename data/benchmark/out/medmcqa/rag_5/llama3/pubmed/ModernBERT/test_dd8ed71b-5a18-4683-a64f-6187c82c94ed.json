["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the best distribution to study the daily admission of head injury patients in a trauma care centre. The key phrase here is 'daily admission'. This suggests that we are looking at a count data, as it's a frequency of events occurring over time. Poisson distribution is typically used for count data, especially when the counts are relatively low and the variance is approximately equal to the mean. In this case, since we are studying daily admissions, which can be thought of as a count of head injury patients arriving at the trauma care centre per day, the Poisson distribution seems like the most appropriate choice.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
