["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about balancing a hand instrument. It seems to relate to surgical instruments rather than laboratory instruments or medical treatment decisions. The relevant documents mention surgical cases, finger injuries, and preparing visuals for court, but none of them specifically discuss the balance of hand instruments. Therefore, I need to rely on my prior knowledge of medical instruments.
