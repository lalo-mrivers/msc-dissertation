["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about how bacteria are most commonly engulfed. The relevant documents provided don't directly address this topic. However, they do provide some context that might be useful. For example, one of the papers discusses onions and radiological terminology. There's no direct connection between onions and bacterial engulfment. Another paper talks about Kaposi's sarcoma, but it doesn't mention bacteria either. The third paper is about a specific type of hemoglobin found in France. Again, there's no connection to bacterial engulfment. Considering the options provided, neutrophilic leukocytes are often involved in phagocytosis of bacteria. Therefore, this seems like the most relevant option.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
