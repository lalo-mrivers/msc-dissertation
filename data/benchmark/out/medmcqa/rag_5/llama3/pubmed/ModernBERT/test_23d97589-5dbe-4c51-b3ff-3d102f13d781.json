["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about a crude birth rate for a sub-center, which is 20. Crude birth rate is the number of live births per thousand population. We are given the birth rate as 20, but we need to find the number of pregnant women registered in the sub-center. To do this, we need to consider that the birth rate is not directly related to the number of pregnant women, and we don't have any information about the population or the number of births. Therefore, we cannot make an estimate of the number of pregnant women based on the given birth rate.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
