["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"After reviewing the provided documents, I did not find any information about a 'Tubercle of Zukerkandle'. As the question is related to tooth morphology, I looked for any mentions of molar teeth in the given texts. The only relevant mention is in 'Autolok band', which discusses retinal detachment and retinal bands, but does not provide information about tubercles or molars. The other documents discuss various topics such as dermatitis, keratoacanthoma, fontechevade II, and congenitally corrected transposition, but do not mention teeth or the tubercle of Zukerkandle. Therefore, I must conclude that this question is likely to be a distractor or an error.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
