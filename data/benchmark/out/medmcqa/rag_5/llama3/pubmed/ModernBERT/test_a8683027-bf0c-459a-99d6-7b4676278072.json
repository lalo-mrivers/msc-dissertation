["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks for the causative agent of increased BT (blood test) in a healthy volunteer. The history taken from the volunteer denied exposure to NSAlDs. Considering the documents provided, there is no direct information about NSAlDs or its related products causing increased BT. However, we can rule out certain options based on the documents. For instance, the document '[On the presence of anti-rubella immunity in a population of Florence province (author's transl)]' discusses vaccine-related issues, but it does not mention NSAlDs or increased BT. Similarly, '[Acute Hedolite poisoning in humans]' and '[Detection of bromine uptake in cadavers from seawater]' do not provide any information relevant to the question. The document '[Evaluation of Brdicka's reaction in tumor diagnostic (author's transl)]' discusses a specific test, but it does not mention NSAlDs or increased BT. Therefore, we can focus on the potential causes listed: Theophylline, Cephalosporin, Anti-depressants, and Multivitamins containing Vitamin K. The document '[Continuous measurement of the oxygen tension in blood]' is irrelevant to the question.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
