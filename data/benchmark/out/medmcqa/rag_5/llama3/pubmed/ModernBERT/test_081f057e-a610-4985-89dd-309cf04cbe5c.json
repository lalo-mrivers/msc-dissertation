["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the transmission of nociceptive signals. Nociception is the ability to detect and respond to painful stimuli. Based on my understanding of the relevant documents, I did not find any direct references to nociception or pain transmission in the provided texts. However, I can infer that the answer might be related to a brain structure involved in processing pain. The closest I came was the mention of CTG's (cardiotocography) which is an ultrasound-based test used during pregnancy to monitor fetal well-being. This led me to consider the role of the nucleus caudalis in pain transmission, as it is part of the spinal cord and receives nociceptive inputs. Although this is not a direct connection, it seems plausible.\",\n\"answer_choice\": A\n}"]
