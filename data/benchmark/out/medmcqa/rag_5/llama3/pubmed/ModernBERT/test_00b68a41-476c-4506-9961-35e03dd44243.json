["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the synthesis of glycogen through UDPglucose : glycogen glucosyltransferase activity. This enzyme is involved in glycogenesis. Glycogenolysis, on the other hand, involves breaking down stored glycogen into glucose. Both processes share a common intermediate, glycogen. Therefore, we can infer that the enzyme responsible for linking these two processes is the one that modifies glycogen. Glycogen synthase and glycogen phosphorylase are both enzymes involved in glycogen metabolism. Glycogen synthase is the enzyme responsible for adding glucose molecules to form glycogen during glycogenesis, while glycogen phosphorylase breaks down glycogen into glucose during glycogenolysis.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
