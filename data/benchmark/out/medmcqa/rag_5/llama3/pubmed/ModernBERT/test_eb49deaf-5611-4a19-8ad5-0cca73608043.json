["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking which of the given options is NOT used in DIC. DIC stands for Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation. After reviewing the provided documents, I found no mention of Furness-Moore Code or its application in DIC. Therefore, I will focus on the remaining options related to coagulation and fluid management. Heparin is an anticoagulant used to treat DIC. Epsilon amino caproic acid (EACA) is a thrombin inhibitor also used to treat DIC. Blood transfusion may be necessary to manage bleeding in patients with DIC, but it's not directly related to the coagulation process. Intravenous fluids are essential for patient hydration and fluid management, which can be important in treating patients with DIC. Based on this analysis, I believe the answer is not related to any of the provided options.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
