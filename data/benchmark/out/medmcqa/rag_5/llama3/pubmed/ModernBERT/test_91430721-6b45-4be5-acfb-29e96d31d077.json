["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the provided documents, I can see that there is no direct mention of a material turning to liquid upon applying critical shear stress. However, I can consider the rheological properties of human blood plasma discussed in 'Rheological properties of human blood plasma--a comparison of measurements with three different viscometers.' The study mentions that plasma is a non-Newtonian fluid with a pseudoplastic rheological behavior, which means its viscosity decreases under increasing shear rate. This type of behavior is not directly related to the given question. I can also consider 'Conditions of flow at interfaces with flexible walls' and 'Creep of dental amalgam and its phases', but these documents do not provide any information on a material turning to liquid upon applying critical shear stress.\n\nTherefore, I will focus on the concept of non-Newtonian fluids and their behavior under different types of flow. From this perspective, when a material turns to liquid upon applying critical shear stress, it is likely exhibiting Bingham body behavior. This type of behavior is characterized by a yield stress below which the material remains solid, and above which it flows like a Newtonian fluid.\n\nAccordingly, my answer is: A: Bingham body behaviour\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
