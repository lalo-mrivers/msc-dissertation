["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Phenobarbital increases spontaneous transmitter release at the frog neuromuscular junction. This effect is due to an increase in presynaptic free calcium concentration. The question asks about ACh release from a presynaptic neuron, which suggests that we are looking for a mechanism that increases the release of neurotransmitters, like ACh. From the given information, the only option that makes sense is A: Blocking calcium channels on presynaptic.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
