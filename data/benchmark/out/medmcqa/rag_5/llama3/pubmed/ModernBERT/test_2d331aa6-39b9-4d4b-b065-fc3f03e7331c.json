["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks how LA (Local Anesthetic) acts on nerve membrane. The answer lies in understanding the mechanism of action of local anesthetics. They work by blocking the movement of sodium ions (Na+) across the nerve cell membrane, thereby preventing the generation and propagation of action potentials. This means that the conductance of Na+ from the interior to the exterior of the nerve cell is blocked.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
