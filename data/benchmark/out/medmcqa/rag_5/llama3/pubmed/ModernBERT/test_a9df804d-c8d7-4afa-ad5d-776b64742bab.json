["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about a permanent tooth with fracture involving apical one-third of the root after treatment. The key point here is that the fracture involves the apex of the root, which could potentially lead to internal resorption. This is supported by the documents provided, especially [Secondary retention of a permanent tooth], which mentions retrograde movement and re-inclusion of a tooth without involvement of the antrum. This suggests that the apical one-third of the root may be more prone to resorption. Therefore, it's most likely that the tooth would exhibit internal root resorption.\", \"answer_choice\": A}"]
