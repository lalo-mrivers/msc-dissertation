["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about a dentist planning to remove an impacted tooth. Impacted teeth are typically located in the mandibular or maxillary bone, which requires radiographs that provide views of these areas. Periapical films would not be sufficient as they only show the root apices and surrounding periodontium. Bite-wing films are used for caries detection and periodontal probing and therefore would not be relevant to impacted tooth removal. Lateral view is an option, but it may not provide clear visualization of the impacted tooth's location and position. Anteroposterior view provides a view of the entire jaw, which could be useful in this case.\", \"answer_choice\": D}"]
