["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, none of them directly address rapid axonal flow or its mediation. However, one document discusses axonal transport of glycogen in neurons innervating cutaneous receptors (Morphological evidence for axonal transport of glycogen in neurons innervating cutaneous receptors in Lacerta sicula (Squamata: Reptilia)). This suggests that axoplasmic transport is involved in the process. Kinesin and dynein are motor proteins responsible for microtubule-based movement of organelles along microtubules, while neurofilaments and microtubules provide structural support to the neuron.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"]
