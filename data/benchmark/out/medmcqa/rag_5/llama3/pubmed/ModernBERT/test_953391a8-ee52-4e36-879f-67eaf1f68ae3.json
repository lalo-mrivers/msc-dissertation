["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the maximum masticatory forces taken up by which fibers. The provided documents are unrelated to the topic of dental extraction or jaw movement, except for one: 'An apparatus for measuring the forces of dental extraction.' This suggests that the answer might be related to dental anatomy and function. Considering the options, A refers to the alveolar crest, which is a bony ridge surrounding the tooth sockets. B, C, and D refer to types of fibers in the jaw or teeth. Therefore, it is unlikely that the maximum masticatory forces would be taken up by the alveolar crest.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"]
