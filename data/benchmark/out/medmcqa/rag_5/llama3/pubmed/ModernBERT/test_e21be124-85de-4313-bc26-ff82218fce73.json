["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the exposure of a pulp horn during restorative procedures on primary molars. Since primary molars are being referred to, we can eliminate options C and D as they relate to secondary molars. The remaining options A and B describe the mesiobuccal and distobuccal pulp horns respectively, both of which are present in primary molars. However, restorative procedures on primary molars typically require access to the pulp horn that is most proximal to the occlusal surface. This suggests that the exposed pulp horn would be more likely the mesiobuccal pulp horn.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
