["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"None of the provided documents relate to topical hemostatic agents or their properties. Therefore, we must analyze the options given for the question. The terms 'Bone wax & patty', 'HemCon bandage', 'Quikclot', and 'Fixclot' are all related to topical hemostatic agents. However, without further information about these agents, it is impossible to determine which one is not a topical hemostatic agent. Therefore, we must consider external knowledge. Topical hemostatic agents work by either causing blood vessels to constrict or forming a physical barrier over the wound. In this context, all four options are topical hemostatic agents: Bone wax & patty creates a physical barrier, while HemCon bandage and Quikclot (and Fixclot) cause blood vessel constriction. No information in any of the provided documents suggests otherwise.\", \"answer_choice\": D}"]
