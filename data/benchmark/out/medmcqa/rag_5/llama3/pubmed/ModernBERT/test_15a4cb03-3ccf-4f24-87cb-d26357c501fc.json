["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the problem associated with wide divergent roots of primary teeth. The options provided are related to the resorption or extraction process. I will analyze each option to determine which one best fits the description.\\r\\n\\r\\nOption A suggests that during resorption, the apical 1/3rd may remain unresorbed. This makes sense as wide divergent roots could lead to incomplete resorption.\\r\\n\\r\\nOption B proposes that during extraction, fracture of the apical 1/3rd may occur due to the unusual root structure. This also seems plausible given the potential for uneven extraction forces.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe other options do not seem relevant to the description, so I will focus on A and B.\\r\\n\\r\\nConsidering both options together, it appears that the problem associated with wide divergent roots of primary teeth is more related to the extraction process than resorption. Therefore, the correct answer is likely B: During extraction, fracture of apical 1/3rd may be there.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
