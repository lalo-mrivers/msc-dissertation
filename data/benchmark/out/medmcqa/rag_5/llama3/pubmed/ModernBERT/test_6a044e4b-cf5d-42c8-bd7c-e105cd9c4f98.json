["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"There is no relevant information about tooth formation stages in the provided documents. However, we can look for information related to tooth development or morphology. The document [Shape of the denture base and self-cleaning] talks about the relationship between the extent of the gap between teeth and denture and the formation of plaque, but it doesn't provide information about tooth formation stages.

The document [Narrow or wide brackets? Biomechanical investigation of friction on bracket form] is about biomechanics and doesn't provide information about tooth formation stages either.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
