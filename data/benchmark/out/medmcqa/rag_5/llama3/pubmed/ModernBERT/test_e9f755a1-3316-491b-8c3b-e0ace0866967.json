["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about a patient who has been wearing a distal extension partial denture for 3 weeks and now reports sensitivity to chewing pressure. The relevant documents suggest that the procedure of provisional splinting in advanced periodontal disease involves constructing a provisional splint with suitable periodontal therapy to allow time for evaluation prior to deciding whether to commit the patient to permanent stabilization. This is not directly related to the question, but it may be considered as one possible option. However, based on the provided information, the most probable reason for the sensitivity would be an issue with the denture itself rather than a problem with the underlying teeth or bone. Therefore, I will focus on the options that are related to the denture. The first possibility is improper occlusion, which could cause discomfort while chewing. The second option is abrasion of tooth by clasp, which may also lead to sensitivity. The third option is wearing off the cement base, which could cause the denture to move or become loose, leading to discomfort during chewing. Finally, passive retentive arm refers to a situation where the arm of the partial denture is not securely retained and can be pushed out of place by chewing pressure. Considering all these options, I think that the most probable reason for the sensitivity would be improper occlusion.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
