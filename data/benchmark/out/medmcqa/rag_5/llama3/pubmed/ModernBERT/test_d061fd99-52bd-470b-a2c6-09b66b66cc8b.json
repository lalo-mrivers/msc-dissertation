["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about a condition where there is loss of interdental bone on facial and lingual plate, without involvement of radicular bone. After reviewing the provided documents, I did not find any information related to dental or oral structures. Therefore, I need to rely on general medical knowledge. Intrabony defects refer to the loss of bone in the bony periodontal ligament, which does not match the description. Craters are not a recognized medical term. Ledges and reverse architecture are terms used in dentistry but they do not describe the exact condition mentioned in the question. Based on this information, I conclude that the answer is C: Intrabony defect.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
