["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Since we know that a screening test is used in the same way in two similar populations (A and B), it means that the test protocol, sensitivity, and specificity are the same for both populations. This implies that the difference in false positive results between population A and population B cannot be due to any differences in the test itself (as this would affect both populations equally). Therefore, we need to look at other factors that could contribute to the difference in false positive rates.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
