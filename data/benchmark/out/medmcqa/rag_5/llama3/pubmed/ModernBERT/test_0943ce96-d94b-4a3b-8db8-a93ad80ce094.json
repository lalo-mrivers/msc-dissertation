["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about a 4-year-old child with 0.2 ppm fluoride in drinking water. We need to find out which options are suitable for the child. Since the child is already receiving some amount of fluoride through their drinking water, we should focus on whether the options provide additional fluoride or not. Option A provides 1 mg tab/day which is a significant increase compared to what the child is already getting from the drinking water. Options B and D also provide additional fluoride, whereas option C does not directly add more fluoride. Therefore, we can rule out options A, B, and D as they might cause an overdose of fluoride. This leaves us with only one option, which is the correct answer.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
