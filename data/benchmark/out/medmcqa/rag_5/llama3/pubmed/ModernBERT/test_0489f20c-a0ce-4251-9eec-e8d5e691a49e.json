["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Metoprolol is a beta blocker, which would slow down the heart rate. Verapamil is a calcium channel blocker, which would also slow down the heart rate and could cause AV block (atrioventricular block). Since both medications are cardioactive and have similar mechanisms of action, they would likely work together to further slow down the heart rate and increase the risk of AV block. Therefore, the most likely outcome is Bradycardia with AV Block.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
