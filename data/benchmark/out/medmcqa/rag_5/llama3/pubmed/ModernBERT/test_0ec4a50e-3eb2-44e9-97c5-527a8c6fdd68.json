["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks which muscle is not inserted to the greater tubercle of humerus. The relevant documents provide information about the anatomy of different muscles and their insertions. One document describes the anatomy of the rotator cuff and mentions that the supraspinatus muscle inserts at two points, mainly into the major tubercle and partly into the lesser tubercle. Another document provides a general overview of the muscles around the shoulder joint, including the teres minor and subscapularis which insert into the greater tubercle. Based on this information, it can be inferred that supraspinatus is inserted to both major and lesser tubercles but not the greater tubercle. Therefore, the correct answer is A: Supraspinatus.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
