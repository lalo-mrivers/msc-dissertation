["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"This question is related to dental caries, and I need to analyze the provided documents for any relevant information. After reviewing the documents, I didn't find any direct mention of carious lesions or dental debridement. However, one document mentions 'salvage' of ischaemic tissue using omental transposition in case of x-ray ulcers. This might suggest that leaving a thin layer of tissue to promote healing could be beneficial. Another document discusses ureteric lesions and the importance of early diagnosis and treatment. Neither of these documents provides direct guidance on dental caries or debridement. Based on this analysis, I will rely on general knowledge of dental caries management.\", \"answer_choice\": C}"]
