["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the major pattern of accessory canals in mandibular first molars. None of the given documents directly mention this topic. However, I will review each document to see if it provides any relevant information.\n\nDocument 1 discusses the planimetry of negative replicas on the mandibular joints from older men and shows very important relations between the squamal discoidal and mandibular faces. This is not related to accessory canals in mandibular first molars.\n\nDocument 2 reports a case of complex odontoma preventing the eruption of a molar, with surgical removal resulting in the tooth erupting. Again, this is unrelated to the topic of accessory canals.\n\nDocument 3 discusses crown component variation in the hominoid lower second premolar and shows an increase in retrieval of morphological information over conventional measurements of maximum dental length and breadth. This document does not provide any information about accessory canals.\n\nDocument 4 reports a developmental anomaly of Meckel's cartilage, leading to the formation of a supernumerary bony fragment in the concavity of the lower edge of the mandibular arch. While this is an interesting finding, it does not relate to accessory canals in mandibular first molars.\n\nDocument 5 discusses angular invariants in developing human mandibles and shows that recent studies of lateral cephalograms based on symmetric-axis analyses of the mandibular border yield angles that appear to be uninfluenced by gross changes in mandibular shape over age and between individuals. This document does not provide any information about accessory canals.\n\nBased on my review of these documents, I have found no direct evidence related to the major pattern of accessory canals in mandibular first molars.\n\nHowever, I will consider Document 5's mention of symmetric-axis analyses of the mandibular border, which might be indirectly relevant. This document suggests that angles remain relatively constant over age and between individuals. While this is not directly related to accessory canals, it does imply a degree of consistency in mandibular shape.\n\nConsidering these points, I will now choose an answer from the given options:\n\nFinally, I believe that the correct answer is: B: A lateral canal extends from coronal third to furcal region particular in distal canal\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
