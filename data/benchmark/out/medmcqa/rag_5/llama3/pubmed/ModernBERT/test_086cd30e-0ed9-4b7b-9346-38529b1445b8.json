["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about monitoring pregnancy progression. The relevant document is [Dynamics of forward fetal movement during labor and its graphic interpretation]. The paper provides echographic findings of dynamics of fetal forward movement along the reproductive tract from 88 parturients. It has been found that displacement of the placenta previa was recorded by echography when the cervix uteri was 3'36 cm dilated and this continued in accordance with the type revealed (ascending, stepwise, or wave-like). The graphs of fetal head displacement were generally similar to those of increased dilatation of the uterine orifice. Therefore, it is reasonable to start plotting pregnancy progression at 3-4 cm cervical dilation.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
