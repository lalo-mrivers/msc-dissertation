["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To find the standard error (SE), we need to know that the formula for SE is SD / sqrt(n). Given the problem statement, we have: SD = 1 and n = 100. Therefore, we can plug in these values into the formula. This gives us: SE = 1 / sqrt(100) = 0.1.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
