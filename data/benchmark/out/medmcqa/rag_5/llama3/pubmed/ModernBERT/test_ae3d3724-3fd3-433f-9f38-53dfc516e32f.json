["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The problem statement mentions that V=-30. Since there is no net electrogenic transfer at the resting membrane potential (RMP), we can assume that the potassium ion equilibrium potential (EK) is close to -30mV. The potassium ion equilibrium potential is given by the Nernst equation, which relates EK to the concentration of K+ ions outside and inside the cell. From the given document [Membrane potential levels in Acetabularia mediterranea cells during changes in temperature of the medium], we know that EK equals -104 MV when there is an electrogenic Cl-pump. Since V=-30, we can set up a proportion to find Z: Z / (Z + 104) = (-30) / (-104). Solving for Z, we get Z = 80.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
