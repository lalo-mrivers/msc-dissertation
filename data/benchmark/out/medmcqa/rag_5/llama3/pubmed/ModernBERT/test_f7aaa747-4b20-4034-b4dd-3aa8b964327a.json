["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, I'll review the provided documents to see if any of them mention lymphatic spread or malignancy. After reviewing the documents, I didn't find any direct information about lymphatic spread or malignancy in Kaposi's sarcoma, small kidney, congenital syphilis, or Burkitt's lymphoma. However, I did come across a radiological term 'onion skin' which can be used to describe a pathological abnormality. Since the question is asking about which malignancy is least commonly associated with lymphatic spread, I'll consider the options provided. None of the documents directly address this specific question, so I'll rely on general knowledge and characteristics of each type of cancer.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
