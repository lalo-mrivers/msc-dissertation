["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The given data includes total number of births (456), deaths before 28 days (56) and between 28 days to 1 year (34). To calculate the infant mortality rate, we need to calculate the total number of deaths in the first year. It's given as 500. Deaths before 28 days (56) + deaths between 28 days-1 year (34) = 90. The remaining deaths are 500 - 90 = 410. These are deaths within the first year. Total births were 456, so infant mortality rate is 410/456 ≈ 0.9049 or 90.49%. Since the question asks for the rate per 1000 live births, we need to multiply this by 1000 and divide by total number of births. (90.49 * 1000) / 456 ≈ 197.4.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A: 197.4\""]
