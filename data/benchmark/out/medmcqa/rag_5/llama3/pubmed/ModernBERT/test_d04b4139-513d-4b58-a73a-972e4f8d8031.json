["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about avoiding failure of partial dentures due to poor clasp design. The relevant documents discuss various aspects of dental restoration and prosthetics, but none of them specifically mention clasps or their designs. However, we can infer that the focus should be on designing a clasp that evenly distributes stress and does not rely solely on one tooth for support. This is evident from the articles discussing impression techniques, restoration materials, and lingual flange design in complete dentures. Therefore, it is likely that using stress breakers would help distribute pressure more evenly, thus avoiding failure due to poor clasp design.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
