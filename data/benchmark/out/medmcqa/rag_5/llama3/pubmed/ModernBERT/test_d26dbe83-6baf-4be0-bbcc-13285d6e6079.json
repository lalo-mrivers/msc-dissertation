["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about excision of the submandibular gland for calculus or tumours. The incision is below the angle of the jaw, which suggests that the procedure is related to the mandible and potentially the inferior alveolar nerve. This information leads me to focus on options B and C, as they are both nerves associated with the face and neck. Option A refers to a nerve in the cervical spine, which seems unrelated to this procedure. Option D does not seem relevant based on the provided information. Given the location of the incision and the nature of the procedure, I am leaning towards option B.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
