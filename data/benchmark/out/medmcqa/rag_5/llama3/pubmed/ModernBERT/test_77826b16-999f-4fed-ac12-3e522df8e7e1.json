["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the provided documents, we don't have any information directly related to radiation exposure. However, one of the papers discusses the use of radiometric method for microbiological control in food industries. The [14C]lysine labeling method is used to detect microbial contamination. This suggests that certain microorganisms may be sensitive to radiation exposure. None of the other documents mention radiation exposure. Therefore, we can infer that microorganisms are likely sensitive to radiation exposure.\n\nNow, considering the options for least sensitive to radiation exposure, we can eliminate options A (Bone), B (Hematopoietic tissue) and C (Nerve) because they are all tissues that may be exposed to radiation in various contexts. Muscle is a tissue that is not typically exposed to radiation, so it's possible that muscle might be less sensitive to radiation exposure.\n\nTherefore, based on our inference about microorganisms being sensitive to radiation exposure and the lack of radiation exposure for muscle, we can conclude that muscle is likely the least sensitive to radiation exposure.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
