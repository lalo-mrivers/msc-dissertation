["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question presents a patient with carcinoma larynx and stridor. The main concern is the airway obstruction caused by the tumor. Since it's an emergency, immediate management is required. Considering the options, planned tracheostomy doesn't seem feasible as the patient has stridor, which means there's already some level of airway obstruction. Immediate tracheostomy might be too aggressive and could worsen the situation. High dose steroid might help reduce swelling but won't address the immediate issue of airway obstruction. Intubation with bronchodilators could provide temporary relief, but waiting 12 hours before proceeding to tracheostomy might not be an option given the urgency.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
