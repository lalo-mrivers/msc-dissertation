["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question states that no agglutination is seen when antiserum A and antiserum B are added to a blood sample with Rh+ve factor.

The fact that no agglutination occurs despite the addition of both antiserum A and antiserum B also supports this conclusion.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
