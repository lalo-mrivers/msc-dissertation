["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about dentin islands in the root canals of permanent teeth. The provided documents mention different types of teeth such as incisors, molars, and premolars. We need to find which type of tooth is mentioned in relation to root canals or dentin islands. In 'Anatomy of root canals', deciduous teeth are discussed, but there is no specific mention of permanent teeth. However, in 'Analysis of the Iraqi dentition: mesiodistal crown diameters of permanent teeth', different types of permanent teeth are mentioned, including molars and premolars. This suggests that we should focus on these types of teeth. Then, by comparing 'Dentin island' with the information provided about molars and premolars, we can deduce that dentin islands might be associated with molar or premolar root canals.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
