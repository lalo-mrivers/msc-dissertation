["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the percentage of lost radio-resistant cells in retina. None of the provided documents mention the loss of radio-resistant cells in the retina. However, we can try to connect the dots by looking at the document titles. 'C3 receptors on direct plaque-forming cells' and 'Transitional cell carcinoma: lymphocyte-mediated cytotoxicity' do not seem relevant to this question either. 'A recurring temperature-sensitive mutant class of BHK-21 cells' might be irrelevant as well, since it does not mention retina or radio-resistant cells.\n\nLooking at the remaining documents, 'Microtransplantation of hormone receptors by cell fusion' and 'Radioactive cell membrane labelling', we can try to relate them. The concept of radioactive cell membrane labelling might be relevant here, but it does not provide direct information about the percentage of lost radio-resistant cells in retina.\n\nHowever, 'Radioactive cell membrane labelling' does mention PKH95 as a new cell tracking compound for high-sensitivity cell tracking and biodistribution studies. This makes us think that maybe there is some connection between radio-resistance and cell membranes or cell tracking. We can try to look at the question again from this perspective.\n\nIn 'Radioactive cell membrane labelling', it does not mention retina explicitly, but it does talk about cellular tracking and biodistribution studies. Since we are looking for lost radio-resistant cells in retina, we can consider that maybe the document is implying that these cells might be related to retina.\n\nHowever, there is no clear connection between this document and the question about percentage of lost radio-resistant cells in retina. Therefore, our answer would have to be based on a guess or an assumption.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"]
