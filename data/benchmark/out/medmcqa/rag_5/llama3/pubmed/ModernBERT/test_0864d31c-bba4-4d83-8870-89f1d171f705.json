["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about imaging in the primary survey of a trauma patient. The relevant documents mention different types of imaging such as X-ray, CT scan, and tomographies. We can start by analyzing what information is available about each type of imaging. From the document [Orbital fractures by blow-out (author's transl)], we learn that orbital fractures are diagnosed with frontal tomographies. This suggests that tomographies are used to diagnose specific types of fractures. The document [Role of computerized axial tomography in neuroradiology. 1st results] reports on the use of CT scans for studying space occupying hemispheric lesions and cerebral atrophy. This indicates that CT scans are used to study brain lesions and atrophy. There is no mention of X-ray being mandatory or not, but chest X-rays and pelvic X-rays are taken as part of primary survey in one of the documents. Therefore, option A is incorrect. Option B is true since chest X-ray and pelvic X-ray are mentioned as part of primary survey. Option D is also incorrect because it implies that all patients should have a PA view only, which is not supported by any of the documents. This leaves us with option C, which suggests that hemodynamically unstable patients should not be sent for CT scan. However, there is no evidence in the provided documents to support this claim. Therefore, option C is the correct answer.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
