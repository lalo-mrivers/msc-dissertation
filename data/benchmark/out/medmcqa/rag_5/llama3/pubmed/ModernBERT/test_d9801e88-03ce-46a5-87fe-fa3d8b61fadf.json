["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has failed metformin therapy for diabetes. She is morbidly obese, has a history of pancreatitis, and a family history of bladder cancer. The patient does not want to take injections. Given these factors, we should consider medications that are suitable for her condition and are not contraindicated by her medical history. We can see from the provided documents that phenformin was discussed in 'Phenformin and lactic acidosis in a diabetic and a nondiabetic'. This medication has been associated with lactic acidosis, which could be problematic given the patient's pancreatitis history. Therefore, we should not consider phenformin as an option. Pioglitazone is also ruled out because of its association with bladder cancer, which is a concern given the patient's family history. The other options, Liraglutide, Sitagliptin, and Canagliflozin are all GLP-1 receptor agonists or DPP-4 inhibitors that do not have the same concerns as phenformin or pioglitazone.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A: Liraglutide\""]
