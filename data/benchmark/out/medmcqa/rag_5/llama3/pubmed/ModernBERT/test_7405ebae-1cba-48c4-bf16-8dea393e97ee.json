["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the movement of a non-working condyle. Condyles are the rounded ends of long bones that form joints with other bones. Since the context is related to dentistry and prosthetics, we can assume it's referring to the jawbone or mandible. The relevant documents don't explicitly mention condyles, but they do discuss pelvimetry (which is about measuring the pelvis) and articulators (used in dental prosthetics). Articulators are devices that simulate the movement of the mandible. Considering this context, we can deduce that a non-working condyle refers to a non-functional or dysfunctional jaw joint. This makes us think about the possible movements of the jaw when it's not working properly.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
