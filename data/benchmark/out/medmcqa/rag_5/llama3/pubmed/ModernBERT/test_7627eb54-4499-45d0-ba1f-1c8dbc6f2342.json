["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the presence of iron in different biological molecules. Myoglobin is a type of protein that stores oxygen in muscles, and it contains heme groups which have iron as a central atom. Cytochrome is also a protein that plays a role in cellular respiration and has heme groups with iron. Catalase is an enzyme that breaks down hydrogen peroxide and does not contain iron. Pyruvate kinase is an enzyme involved in glycolysis, but it does not have any known iron-containing subunits. Therefore, the correct answer would be D: Pyruvate kinase, as there is no evidence of iron being present in this molecule.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
