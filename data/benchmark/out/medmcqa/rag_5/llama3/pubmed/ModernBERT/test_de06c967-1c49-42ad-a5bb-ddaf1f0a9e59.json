["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the phenomenon of vasomotor reversal of Dale. The relevant documents are discussing various topics such as somatosensory evoked responses, electrocardiogram, refixation, compensatory plasticity, and oscillations. However, none of these topics seem to be related to vasomotor reversal of Dale. Therefore, we need to look beyond the provided documents for an answer. Vasomotor reversal of Dale is a phenomenon described by Henry Dale in 1935, where stimulation of alpha-1 receptors causes vasoconstriction, but when beta-2 receptors are stimulated afterwards, it leads to vasodilation instead of the expected vasoconstriction. This is because beta-2 receptor stimulation can override the vasoconstrictive effect of alpha-1 receptor stimulation. Therefore, the answer requires us to think about how we can demonstrate this phenomenon in an animal model.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"]
