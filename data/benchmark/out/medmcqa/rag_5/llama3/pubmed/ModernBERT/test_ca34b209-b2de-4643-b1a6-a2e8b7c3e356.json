["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about observing an occluded submandibular salivary duct. The relevant documents are about the mandibular joints, absence of thumb nails, coloscopic inversion, and reconstruction of oral mucocutaneous junction. None of these documents provide information about the submandibular salivary duct. Therefore, we need to look for a document that discusses the salivary duct. The document [Luxatio pedis subtalo] does not mention the salivary duct either. However, it is possible that one of the other two documents may have some relevance. Unfortunately, neither Anonychia with ectrodactyly nor Reconstruction of the oral mucocutaneous junction provides information about the submandibular salivary duct either. Therefore, we need to consider the remaining options. Sialography is a radiographic technique used to visualize the salivary glands and their ducts, including the submandibular salivary duct. Therefore, it is the most likely option.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
