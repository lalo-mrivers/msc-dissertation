["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about a condition where mandibular stabilization is not governed by facial nerve contraction. None of the given options seem to be directly related to this concept. Upon reviewing the provided documents, I found that only one document discusses mandibular stability (A simple clamp for stabilization of the mandible during surgery). This document does not provide any information about conditions where facial nerve contraction is or isn't involved. Therefore, I will rely on my general knowledge of anatomy and physiology to answer this question.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
