["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the most radiosensitive organ in the pelvic region. Upon reviewing the documents, I see that there's a mention of radiotherapy in the treatment of carcinoma of the cervix (document 1) and also in the treatment of locally spread malignant tumors under conditions of preliminary radiotherapy (document 3). This suggests that radiation therapy is being used to treat tumors in this region. In pelvic external beam irradiation, the rectum is known to be a sensitive organ to radiation due to its proximity to the pelvic field. This information from my knowledge helps me to narrow down the options.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
