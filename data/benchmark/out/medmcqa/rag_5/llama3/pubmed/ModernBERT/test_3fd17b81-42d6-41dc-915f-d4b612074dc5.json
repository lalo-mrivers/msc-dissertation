["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the effect of broad-spectrum antibiotics on coumarin anticoagulants. Coumarin anticoagulants work by inhibiting vitamin K-dependent clotting factors in the liver. Vitamin K is essential for the production of these clotting factors. Broad-spectrum antibiotics can affect vitamin K levels by reducing gut flora that produce vitamin K or directly interfering with vitamin K-dependent enzymes. This could increase the anticoagulant action of coumarin anticoagulants.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
