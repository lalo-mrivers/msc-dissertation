["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant document for this question is '[Application of coronal discharge to measure biophysical gas flow]' as it discusses a device that produces an ion beam between a cathode point, a square diaphragm and a collector plane (anode). The speed with which the electrons travel from the filament of cathode to the anode depends on the potential difference between the two electrodes. This is because the characteristic curve I(V) shows that the current can become monotonous if a current feedback is applied to the diaphragm, indicating that the voltage plays a crucial role in determining the electron flow.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
