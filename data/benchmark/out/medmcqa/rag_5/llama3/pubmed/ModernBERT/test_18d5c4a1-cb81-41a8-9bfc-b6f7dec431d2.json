["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"This question is about diagnosing an ECG. None of the relevant documents mention ECG or heart rhythms, so I need to use general medical knowledge to approach this question. Since none of the options seem related to the provided documents, I will rely on general cardiology knowledge. Ventricular bigeminy refers to a type of arrhythmia where every QRS complex is followed by another one. Electrical alternans is a phenomenon where the amplitude of the QRS complex varies from beat to beat. P pulmonale would indicate right atrial enlargement. Left ventricular failure would not be diagnosed solely based on an ECG. Based on this analysis, I think the correct answer is likely Ventricular bigeminy.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
