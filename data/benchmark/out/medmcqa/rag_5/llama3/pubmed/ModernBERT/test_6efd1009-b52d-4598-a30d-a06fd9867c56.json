["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 36-week primigravida with a single seizure episode. The examination reveals hypertension (BP 170/100) and tachycardia (PR 90/min). This suggests that the seizure may have been triggered by preeclampsia, which is common in pregnant women. Therefore, the immediate next step would be to control her blood pressure.\n\nThe options provided are:\n\n* Inj. mgso4: Magnesium sulfate injection is commonly used to treat seizures related to preeclampsia.\n* Inj. Calcium gluconate: This medication is not typically used for seizure treatment in this scenario.\n* Inj Phenetoin: Phenytoin is an anticonvulsant, but it's not the primary choice for treating seizures related to preeclampsia.\n* MRI brain: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is not necessary at this stage of management.\n\nBased on the available information, the most appropriate next step would be to administer magnesium sulfate injection to control the patient's blood pressure and potentially prevent further seizures.\", \"answer_choice\": A}"]
