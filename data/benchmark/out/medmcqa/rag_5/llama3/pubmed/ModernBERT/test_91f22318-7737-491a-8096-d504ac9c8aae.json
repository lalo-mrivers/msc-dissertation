["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"In this question, we are trying to determine the type of data that allows us to calculate mean and standard deviation. From the given documents, there is no direct mention of the calculation of mean and standard deviation. However, if we consider the general rules for calculating mean and standard deviation, we can infer that the data should be on interval or ratio scale. This is because mean and standard deviation are measures of central tendency and variability respectively, which are applicable only to interval or ratio scaled data. Nominal and ordinal scales do not have a natural zero point or equal intervals between consecutive values, making it difficult to calculate mean and standard deviation. Dichotomous scale is also not suitable as it does not provide enough information to calculate these measures.\", \"answer_choice\": A}"]
