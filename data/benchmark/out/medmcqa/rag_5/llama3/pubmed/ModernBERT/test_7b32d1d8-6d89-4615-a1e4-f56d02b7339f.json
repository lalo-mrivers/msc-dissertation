["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks which tooth has a non-functional cusp. From the given documents, there is no information about the shape or function of premolars' cusps. Therefore, we need to rely on general knowledge about dental anatomy. Lower 1st premolars and Upper 1st premolars have the same number of cusps (2-3), while Lower 2nd premolars have a single cusp. Hence, the non-functional cusp is likely to be present in the Lower 2nd premolar.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
