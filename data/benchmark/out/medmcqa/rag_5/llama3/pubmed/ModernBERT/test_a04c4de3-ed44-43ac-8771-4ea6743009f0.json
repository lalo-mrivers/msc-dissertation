["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The given reaction is enzyme-catalyzed, so the initial rate of the reaction depends on the enzyme concentration. Since the substrate concentration is 1000 times the Km value of the enzyme, the reaction is in the initial rate region. The enzyme concentration is changed to 1/3 and the substrate concentration is doubled. This means that the new enzyme concentration is 1/3 times the original, and the new substrate concentration is twice the original. The product formed is 12 microgram/ml, which corresponds to 17o substrate converted into product.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
