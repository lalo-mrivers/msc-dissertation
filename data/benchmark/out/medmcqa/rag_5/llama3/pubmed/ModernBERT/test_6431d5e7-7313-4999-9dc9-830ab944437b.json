["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the avascular necrosis of the distal pole of the scaphoid after a scaphoid fracture. The reason given is that the blood supply of the scaphoid is from distal to proximal. This means that the blood flow comes from the distal end of the bone and flows towards the proximal end. Therefore, if the distal pole is injured or damaged, it may not receive adequate blood flow, leading to avascular necrosis. The statement 'Asseion - Distal pole of scaphoid goes to avascular necrosis after scaphoid fracture' suggests that this indeed occurs.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
