["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks for a false statement regarding sensory endings. Based on the provided documents, I will analyze each option to determine which one is incorrect.\\r\\n\\r\\nOption A 'Annulospiral wrap the ends' seems plausible, as annulospiral endings are a type of mechanoreceptor found in skin and other tissues. \\r\\n\\r\\nOption B 'Primary ending is annulospiral' also appears correct, as primary sensory endings are typically mechanoreceptors that respond to changes in pressure or stretch.\\r\\n\\r\\nOption C 'Primary ending conduct 1a fibres' seems to be accurate, as 1α fibers are the fastest-conducting type of Aδ fiber and are involved in transmitting painful stimuli.\\r\\n\\r\\nOption D 'Flower spray is secondary' appears incorrect, as there is no mention of a 'flower spray' in any of the provided documents. The term 'flower spray' seems to be unrelated to sensory endings.\\r\\n\\r\\nBased on my analysis, I conclude that Option D 'Flower spray is secondary' is the false statement regarding sensory endings.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
