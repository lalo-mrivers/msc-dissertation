["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for a short-acting non-depolarising muscle relaxant. Succinylcholine is known to have a curarelike effect on muscle which makes it suitable as a muscle relaxant. It is also mentioned in the document [Effect of succinyldicholine on central nervous system] that succinyldicholine has a convulsant action, distinct from its curarelike effect on muscle. This suggests that succinylcholine is a non-depolarising muscle relaxant and has a short-acting effect.\", \"answer_choice\": A}"]
