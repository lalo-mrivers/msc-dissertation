["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about a person working in an abattoir with a papule on their hand that turns into an ulcer. This suggests an occupational hazard or exposure to something on the job. Oriental sore (cutaneous leishmaniasis) is mentioned as a case report, but it's unlikely given the occupation and location of the lesion. Keratoacanthoma of the eyelid doesn't seem relevant either. Paralysis of elevation of one eye is also unrelated. Opposition replacement is about restoring opposition of the thumb, not related to hand ulcers. Munchausen syndrome by proxy in twins is a behavioral disorder, not directly applicable here. So, we're left with documents that talk about skin lesions or conditions.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
