["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking which disease affects neurons only. Upon reviewing the provided documents, I did not find any information that directly addresses this question. However, I can analyze each of the diseases listed as options to see if they fit the description.\n\nOption A: Spinocerebellar ataxia - This disease primarily affects the cerebellum and spinal cord, but does not specifically state it only affects neurons.\n\nOption B: Supranuclear palsy - This disease also affects other areas beyond just neurons.\n\nOptions C and D: Corticobasillar degeneration and Multiple system atrophy - These diseases are known to affect multiple systems, including neurons, and do not exclusively affect neurons.\n\nBased on this analysis, I did not find a clear answer that suggests a disease that only affects neurons. Therefore, the step-by-step thinking process led me to conclude that none of the options fit the description of a disease that affects neurons only.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"None of the above\""]
