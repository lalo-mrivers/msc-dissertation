["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the management of overdosage of Fibrinolytics. The relevant documents seem to be discussing various topics such as detoxification, salmonellosis, endemy of human anthrax, and olfactory esthesioneuroblastoma, but none of these directly relate to fibrinolotics or their overdose. Therefore, I will focus on the choices provided. Epsilon amino Caproic Acid is a well-known antagonist of fibrinolytics, Tranexamic Acid is a synthetic derivative that inhibits plasminogen activators and has anti-fibrinolytic properties, DDAVP (1-desamino-8-D-arginine vasopressin) is a hormone that can increase the level of factor VIII and IX in plasma. FFP (Fresh Frozen Plasma) is a blood product containing coagulation factors. Among these choices, only one is not directly related to the management of fibrinolytic overdose. It's FFP.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D: FFP\"}"]
