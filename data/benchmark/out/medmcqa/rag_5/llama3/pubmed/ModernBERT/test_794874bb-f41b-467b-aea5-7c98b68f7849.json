["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the sensory nerve supply of the capsule of TMJ. None of the provided documents mention anything about TMJ or the auriculotemporal nerve. However, we can consider the structure and function of cranial nerves in general. The documents do not provide any specific information about the facial nerve, masseteric nerve, or auricular nerve either. Considering that the nerve stimulator probe was developed for intracranial surgery of the cranial nerves, it's possible to deduce that the sensory nerve supply of the capsule of TMJ might be related to one of these cranial nerves. Based on this reasoning and the available information, we can try to eliminate options B and C as they are not primarily involved in sensation from the TMJ area. This leaves us with A (Auriculotemporal nerve) and D (Auricular nerve). The documents do not provide direct evidence for either option, but based on the anatomical location of the auriculotemporal nerve and its function in providing sensation to the ear and surrounding areas, including the TMJ area, it's a more plausible candidate.\",\n\"answer_choice\": A"]
