["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the characteristic of Tuberculous Otitis Media (T.B. otitis media). None of the provided documents are directly related to T.B. otitis media. However, I can analyze each document to see if there are any common factors or keywords that might be relevant. The first document appears to be a method for typing mycobacteria, which is not relevant to this question. The second document is about haptoglobin types in Turkey and does not seem to have any connection to T.B. otitis media. The third document describes an actinomycosis-like abscess in cattle, but it's not related to the ear or middle ear infections. The fourth document is a karyological analysis of Horsfield's shrew, which has no relevance to this question either. Therefore, I will rely on general knowledge and characteristics commonly associated with T.B. otitis media. In that case, one of the characteristic features is multiple perforations.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
