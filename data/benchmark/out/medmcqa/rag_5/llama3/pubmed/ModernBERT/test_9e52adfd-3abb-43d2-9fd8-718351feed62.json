["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Pelvimetry (author's transl) describes a technique that uses Fernstroem's AP view. Autolok band and Double point test with the Goldmann perimeter are about retinal detachment and hemianopia testing respectively. A rapid method for reading migration inhibition tests is described, and Technical note discusses Trimax system's X-ray exposure reduction. These documents don't mention penetration or rays, so we can safely conclude that the question is related to radiation penetration. Technical note mentions a screen/film combination called Trimax which reduces X-ray exposure by 4 times without deteriorating image quality. This implies that it deals with Gamma rays, as they are most penetrating among all types of ionizing radiation. Therefore, C: Gamma is the correct answer.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"]
