["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the sample size, we need to calculate it using the following formula: n = (z^2 * p * q) / e^2, where n is the sample size, z is the Z-score corresponding to the desired alpha error, p is the prevalence of the disease in the community, q is 1 - p, and e is the relative precision. Given that the alpha error is 5% and the relative precision is 20%, we can calculate the Z-score as follows: Z = z for a given probability (1-0.05) which is approximately 1.96. Now we can plug in the values: n = (1.96^2 * 0.1 * 0.9) / 0.2^2, which simplifies to approximately 900.\", \"answer_choice\": B}"]
