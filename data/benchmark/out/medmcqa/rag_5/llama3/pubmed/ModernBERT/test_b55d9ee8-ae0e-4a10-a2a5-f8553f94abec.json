["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about white radiating lines. We need to find the relevant information from the given documents that talks about such lines. After reviewing the documents, I didn't find any mention of 'white radiating lines' in relation to lichen planus, erythema multiforme, pemphigus or leukoplakia. However, I did come across the Autolok band document which mentions a braided polyester band for retinal detachment. But it doesn't seem related to white radiating lines either. Then I looked at the other documents and found [Syntopy of Bowen's disease and Lewisite scar] which mentions a case of Bowen's disease with an area of lewisite contamination 30 years ago. This makes me think about potential radiation effects, but again no mention of 'white radiating lines'.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"None of the above\""]
