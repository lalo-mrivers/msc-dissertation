["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about diffuse mottling of retina with focal areas of increased and decreased pigmentation. This is a characteristic feature of Salt and pepper retinopathy. The first document mentions macular changes due to corticosteroids, which includes striate and circular pigmental fissures in the macula. However, this does not match the description of Salt and pepper retinopathy.\\nThe second document discusses the pigmentation pattern in the human area striata, but it doesn't provide information about the retina or mottling.\\nThe third document describes reticulum fibres in relation to retinal vessels, which is unrelated to the question.\\n\\nThe fourth document is a case study of Abrikosov's tumor, which also has no relevance to Salt and pepper retinopathy.\\n\\nBased on these documents, it appears that none of them provide information about Salt and pepper retinopathy. Therefore, we need to consider other possible causes.\\nPhenothiazine toxicity is a well-known cause of retinal pigmentation, including diffuse mottling.\\n\\nSo, the answer is likely to be B: Phenothiazine toxicity.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
