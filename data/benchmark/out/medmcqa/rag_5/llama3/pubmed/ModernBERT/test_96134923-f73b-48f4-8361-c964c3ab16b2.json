["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is described as having sudden onset headache, vomiting, neck rigidity without focal neurological deficit. This combination of symptoms suggests a diagnosis that involves inflammation or bleeding within the CNS (Central Nervous System). The presence of neck rigidity and lack of focal neurological deficits points towards a non-ischemic process. Considering these features, we can rule out Ischemic stroke (B) as it typically presents with focal neurological deficits. Subdural hemorrhage (C) is also unlikely given the absence of focal deficits. Meningitis (D) could be a possibility but it's not the most likely diagnosis considering the patient's age and hypertension, which suggests a more vascular-related process. The most plausible explanation is that the patient has a subarachnoid hemorrhage (A), which is characterized by sudden onset headache, vomiting, and neck rigidity.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
