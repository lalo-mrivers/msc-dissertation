["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"There is no relevant information in the provided documents about sublingual tablets or metered dose aerosols. The documents are related to different anaesthetics like CT1341 (Saffan), alcohol, Aldrin, propranolol and ketamine. Since angina is a cardiac condition and none of these anaesthetics have any relation to it, I will focus on the information provided in the question. Sublingual tablets or metered dose aerosols are usually used for immediate relief of angina. GTN (Glyceryl Trinitrate) is commonly used for this purpose. The onset of action of GTN can be as early as 1-2 minutes, so it's unlikely to take more than a few minutes to relieve angina.\", \"answer_choice\": B}"]
