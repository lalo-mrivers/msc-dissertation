["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents provided do not directly mention the total number of vertebrae in the vertebral column. However, we can rely on general anatomical knowledge that states the cervical spine has 7 vertebrae (C1-C7), thoracic spine has 12 vertebrae (T1-T12), lumbar spine has 5 vertebrae (L1-L5), and sacrum has 5 fused vertebrae. Therefore, adding these up gives us a total of: 7 + 12 + 5 + 5 = 29 for the vertebral column. However, this total does not include the coccyx which consists of 3-5 fused vertebrae.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: 52\"\n}"]
