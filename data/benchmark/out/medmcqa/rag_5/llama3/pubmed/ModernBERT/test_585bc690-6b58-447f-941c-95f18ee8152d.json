["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the wedging technique to be used when restoring a lower molar with amalgam having a cavity with a wide buccolingual proximal box. Since there is no specific information mentioned in the given documents related to this scenario, we need to rely on general dental principles and techniques for filling teeth. The wedge technique is commonly used to ensure proper seating of the restoration and prevent over- or under-contouring.

Therefore, based on general dental principles, I would recommend using the Single wedge technique.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
