["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about SCC present on lateral margin of tongue of staging T2N0. Since it's a case of oral cancer, we need to consider the options for treatment. There are no relevant documents provided that directly relate to this specific type of cancer or treatment options. However, we can look at the documents and see if there is any information that could be applicable.\n\nThe first document talks about an open external subtalus dislocation, which has nothing to do with oral cancer or its staging. The second document discusses anthrax, another topic unrelated to oral cancer. The third document is about reconstructing the anterior cruciate ligament, a procedure that doesn't apply to this case either. The fourth document talks about a chromosomal deletion syndrome, also not relevant.\n\nThe last document appears to be about cardiac surgery, specifically operations for atrio-ventricular canal defects. This document has no relevance to oral cancer or its staging.\n\nGiven the lack of any applicable information in the provided documents, we need to rely on general knowledge and guidelines for treating oral cancer. The choice of treatment depends on various factors such as tumor size, location, and stage, as well as patient factors like overall health.\n\nFor a T2N0 case, which means the tumor is localized to the tongue (T2) and has not spread to the lymph nodes (N0), the treatment options would typically involve surgery. The extent of the surgery would depend on the size and location of the tumor.\n\nGiven this information, we can consider the options for treatment: SOHND, removing lymph nodes I-II, III-IV, or all of them. This choice is based on general knowledge and guidelines for treating oral cancer rather than specific information from the provided documents.\", \n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
