["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about a blue newborn with cyanosis. The X-ray chest shows oligemic lung field and normal sized heart. This suggests that the cyanosis is not due to a cardiac defect but rather an issue with blood flow or oxygenation. Considering the documents, Trisomy of chromosome 20 mentions severe anomalies in the gastrointestinal system and spinal dysplasia. Gastroduodenal duplication talks about a pyloroduedenal duplication cyst causing upper gastrointestinal bleeding. Angiographic appearance of benign retroperitoneal lymphoma discusses a rare angiofollicular lymph node hyperplasia, but it doesn't relate to cyanosis or oligemic lung field. [Radiography of breast cancers] and IgD myeloma: immunology and ultrastructure don't provide any relevant information for this question. Considering the available options, Ebstein's anomaly is a possibility, as it can cause cyanosis, but it usually presents with normal chest X-ray. Pulmonary atresia and transposition of great arteries would typically show cardiac defects on the X-ray, which doesn't match the patient's presentation. Tetralogy of Fallot can also cause cyanosis, but the oligemic lung field suggests a different issue.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
