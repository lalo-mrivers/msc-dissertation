["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about differentiating between a dentigerous cyst and an ameloblastoma. Both are odontogenic cysts or tumors that arise from the development of teeth. The case report on Dentigerous cyst in a dog describes the classic clinical and radiographic findings of these cysts. This suggests that radiographic examination would be a good starting point to differentiate between the two lesions. Further, it is stated that ameloblastomas have 'classic' radiographic features which also implies that radiography could be useful. The other options do not seem directly relevant for differentiating between these two specific lesions.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
