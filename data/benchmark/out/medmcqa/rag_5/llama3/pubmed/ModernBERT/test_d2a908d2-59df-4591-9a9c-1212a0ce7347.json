["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the consequence of keeping someone in a Jack-knife position for a long time. Upon reviewing the provided documents, there is no mention of a 'Jack-knife position' or any related information. However, one document mentions a device called Zeiss Fundus Camera which takes photos of the eye fundus. Another document talks about micro-magnetic retainers used in dental care. There is also a brief mention of JCAHO and its relation to nursing. None of these documents provide information on the consequence of keeping someone in a Jack-knife position for long.
