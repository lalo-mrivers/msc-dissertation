["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the most prominent lingual fossa in incisors. After reviewing the provided documents, it's clear that none of the texts provide information related to lingual fossae or dental anatomy.

Hence, it's reasonable to assume that the most prominent lingual fossa would be seen in lateral incisors.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
