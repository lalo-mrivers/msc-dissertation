["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about physiological methods of heat loss from the body. The provided documents are related to topics such as thermoregulation, blood vessels, and cardiovascular system, but none of them specifically discuss heat loss methods. Therefore, we need to consider general physiological concepts of heat loss. One way to lose heat is through sweating, which is a recognized method of heat loss in humans. Vasodilation can also be a means of heat loss as it allows for increased blood flow and thus heat dissipation. Peripheral vasoconstriction, on the other hand, would not be a physiological method of heat loss from the body, as it would actually reduce blood flow and heat loss. Posture is not related to heat loss or thermoregulation, so it's also not a viable option.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
