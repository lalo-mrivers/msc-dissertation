["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is a condition characterized by the formation of blood clots throughout the body. In DIC, the clotting cascade is activated leading to an increase in thrombin and fibrin formation. Therefore, tests that measure coagulation factors or the activity of the clotting cascade may be abnormal in DIC.\n\nActivated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) and clot solubility are both tests that assess the functioning of the clotting cascade. APTT measures the time it takes for blood to clot after the addition of an activator, while clot solubility tests whether a clot can be dissolved by adding sodium citrate.\n\nProthrombin is a vitamin K-dependent coagulation factor and its levels may be abnormal in DIC due to the consumption or inhibition of prothrombin during the coagulation process. D-timer levels are not directly related to the coagulation cascade and therefore would not typically be affected by DIC.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"]
