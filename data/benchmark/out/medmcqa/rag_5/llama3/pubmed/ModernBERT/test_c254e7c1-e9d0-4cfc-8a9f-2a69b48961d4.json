["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question refers to an avulsed tooth that has been replanted. The loss of lamina dura radiographically suggests that the tooth is no longer anchored properly in its socket. This could be due to resorption of the surrounding bone, particularly at the cervical or root apex level.

Based on these findings, it is likely that the type of resorption involved is either external or replacement resorption.\", \"answer_choice\": C}"]
