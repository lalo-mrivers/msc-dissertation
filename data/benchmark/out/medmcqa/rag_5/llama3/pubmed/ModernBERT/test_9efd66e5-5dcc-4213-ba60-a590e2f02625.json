["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Since the question is related to functional appliances in skeletal class II, I'll look for relevant information from [A classification of articulators]. The document doesn't seem to be directly related to the topic. However, it's not mentioned anywhere that maxilla or mandible are abnormal. Therefore, we can focus on other documents. From [Partial deletion of the short arm of chromosome 4. Apropos of 3 cases], there is no mention of skeletal class II or functional appliances. [Group-specific component in Macaca] also doesn't provide any relevant information. The most promising document seems to be [Attempts at reconstitution of skin continuity]. However, this document discusses living skin equivalents and has nothing to do with dental appliances or skeletal class II. Finally, I'll look through [An equipment logging system], which is about a specific type of logging system used in the Intensive Care Unit. There's no mention of functional appliances or skeletal class II here either.\n\nGiven that none of these documents provide any information on the topic of functional appliances in skeletal class II, it seems unlikely that there would be a direct answer in these documents. However, I can still try to find an indirect connection. [A classification of articulators] does not mention anything about skeletal class II or maxilla/mandible abnormalities. [Partial deletion of the short arm of chromosome 4. Apropos of 3 cases] and [Group-specific component in Macaca] are unrelated, and [Attempts at reconstitution of skin continuity] is about living skin equivalents, not dental appliances.\n\nConsidering that none of these documents provide any direct or indirect information on functional appliances in skeletal class II, I will choose an answer based on the available options.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
