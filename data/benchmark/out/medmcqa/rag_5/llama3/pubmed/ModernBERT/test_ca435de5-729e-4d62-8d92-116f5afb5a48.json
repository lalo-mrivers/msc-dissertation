["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To calculate the Nernst potential for this ion, we need to first determine the concentration gradient across the cell membrane. The concentration of the negative ion is 100 mMoL extracellular and 10 mMoL/1 intracellular. This means there is a concentration gradient from high outside (100 mMoL) to low inside (10 mMoL/1). The Nernst equation states that the equilibrium potential for an ion is proportional to the logarithm of the ratio of concentrations. We can plug in the values: E = 61 mV * log([100] / [10]) = 61 mV. Since the ion is a negative ion, we need to make it negative: -61 mV.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
