["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the structures found in a living pulp. The relevant document appears to be related to dental or oral health, given the mention of 'Lameness' and 'canine tooth'. The key information needed to answer this question can be found in the section [Lameness: a 'strange' foreign body]. The text describes the structure of a tooth pulp, mentioning Haversian fibres. Based on this information, it is unlikely that Reticulum would be found in a living pulp. Non-myelinated nerve fibres are not directly related to the structure of a tooth pulp and collagen fibres could potentially be present. Therefore, the correct answer is D: Reticulum.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
