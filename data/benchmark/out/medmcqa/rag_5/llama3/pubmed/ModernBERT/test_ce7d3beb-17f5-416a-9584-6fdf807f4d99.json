["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question presents a 24-year-old female with patchy hair loss on the right temporal and occipital region. The examination reveals non-scarring alopecia with multiple small broken hairs, indicating a possible inflammatory process. Scrapings from scalp show mild inflammation, peri-follicular hemorrhage, and surrounding mild lymphocytic infiltration. This information is similar to that described in Cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome, which includes early total alopecia and persistent hypotrichosis. Although the question does not specify scarring, the presence of small broken hairs suggests an inflammatory process rather than a typical scarring alopecia. Therefore, considering the patient's age and the characteristics of the scalp lesions, Alopecia areata is the most likely diagnosis.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
