["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the cause of trismus (lockjaw). After reviewing the provided documents, I noticed that 'Trapshooter's stigma' is related to friction dermatitis and scarring. This made me think about potential causes of trismus. However, there is no direct mention of trismus in any of the documents. Nevertheless, I need to rely on my knowledge of anatomy and possible associations with the conditions mentioned. Medial pterygoid muscle is known to be involved in jaw movements, and inflammation could lead to trismus. Facial nerve irritation might not directly cause trismus but can affect facial muscles. Superior constrictor and buccinator are also related to mouth and tongue movement but do not seem as likely causes of trismus.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
