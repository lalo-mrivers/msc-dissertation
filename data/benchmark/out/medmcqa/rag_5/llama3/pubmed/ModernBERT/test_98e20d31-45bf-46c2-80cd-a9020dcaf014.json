She has no money for transportation to the nearby hospital. After analyzing the provided documents, it can be inferred that there is no direct connection between the given scenario and any specific disease mentioned in the documents (e.g., Friedreich's disease, baby bottle tooth decay). The only relevant information is about a woman with diabetes who had fabricated her condition. This does not seem to relate to the current situation.\n\nGiven that this is a general scenario involving a recently delivered mother and her child, the answer should focus on national programs that provide assistance for maternal and child health care. JSSK (Janani Suraksha Yojana) is a government program in India that provides free transportation and institutional delivery support to pregnant women.
