["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the significance of non-visualization of gallbladder in hepatic scintigraphy. Based on the provided documents, there are no direct references to this specific scenario. However, we can make an educated guess by considering the role of ultrasound in detecting splenomegaly and diagnosing ocular fundus lesions. Since the question is related to the gallbladder, we should look for relevant information that might be indirectly applicable. The case report on traumatic haemobilia mentions the use of ultrasonography in investigating hepatic trauma, but this scenario is different from non-visualization of gallbladder. Therefore, our focus remains on trying to find any indirect hints or parallels between the provided documents and the question.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
