["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the absorption of fluoride in a child. Since there are no documents directly related to the absorption of fluoride in children, we will look for information that could help us answer this question. We can start by looking at how fluoridation affects adult dental caries, as it might provide some insights on how fluoride is absorbed. The document mentions that fluoridation appears to have both pre- and post-eruptive benefits, but it does not directly address the absorption of fluoride in children. We then look at another document about magnesium in bone mineral, which seems unrelated to our question. Finally, we consider a document about an apparatus for hyperchlorination of rodent drinking water, which also does not seem relevant. At this point, we should focus on the structure and function of the oral cavity, as it is where fluoride is most commonly associated with. Based on our understanding of how fluoride is commonly used in dental caries prevention, we can infer that absorption of fluoride in children takes place mainly in the oral cavity.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"]
