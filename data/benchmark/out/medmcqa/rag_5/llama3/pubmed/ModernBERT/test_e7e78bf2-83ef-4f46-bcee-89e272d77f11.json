["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the movement of condyle. Condyle refers to the head or rounded end of a bone. In this case, it's likely referring to the mandibular condyle. The mandibular condyle articulates with the temporal bone during jaw movement. Lateral movement of the condyle implies a movement away from the midline. There are two lateral pterygoid muscles, one on each side, that help move the mandible laterally during chewing. Since the question is asking about lateral movement of the condyle, it's likely referring to movement towards or away from the opposite side. Therefore, it's possible that the answer could be either A or B.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
