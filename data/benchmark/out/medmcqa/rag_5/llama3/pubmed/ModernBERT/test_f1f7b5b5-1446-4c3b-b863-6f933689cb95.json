["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about callus formation. Callus formation is a process that occurs during bone healing. Irradiation of onions is mentioned as a method to identify them by failure to root formation, which is unrelated to the topic. Go-kart injuries and Burkitt's lymphoma are also not relevant to this question. The text 'More on the care and feeding of the Padgett dermatome' does not provide any information about callus formation either. Therefore, we should focus on the text '[Atypical Kaposi's disease]. To demonstrate that Kaposi's sarcoma may initially take several different courses, a case is presented and the literature reviewed.' The only relevant passage in this text is 'To demonstrate that Kapsi's sarcoma may initially take several different courses...' which does not mention callus formation. The remaining option is from the text '[Identification of irradiated onions (author's transl)]. A method is described by which irradiated onions are identified by failure to root formation.' This passage mentions something about 'root formation' but it doesn't provide any information about callus formation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
