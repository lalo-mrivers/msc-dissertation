["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is presenting with massive hemoptysis. The routine investigations and chest X-ray are normal. This suggests that the bleeding is likely from a non-vascular source, such as an airway or bronchial mucosa. None of the options provided involve surgical intervention (lobectomy), which would not be indicated in this scenario. Bronchial artery embolization and pulmonary artery embolization are both vascular procedures that target blood vessels involved in bleeding.
