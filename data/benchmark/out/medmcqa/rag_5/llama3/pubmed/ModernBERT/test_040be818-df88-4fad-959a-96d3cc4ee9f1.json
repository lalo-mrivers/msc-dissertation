["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"There is no relevant information provided in the given documents that directly addresses the question about streptococci's ability to adhere to tooth surfaces. However, we can analyze the studies provided. The first study discusses dental lamina and its relation to cysts and tumors, which does not provide any information on streptococci or caries development. The second study talks about post-eruptive formation of root apex and the composition of immature teeth with incompletely formed roots, which is also irrelevant to the question. The third study discusses periodontal prosthesis and creating successful restorations in cases of advanced periodontal disease, but it does not mention streptococci or caries development. The fourth study talks about anatomy of root canals in deciduous teeth, which again does not provide any information related to the question.\n\nThe only relevant information is from the studies on streptococci, and those are not provided in these documents. Therefore, we must rely on general knowledge of microbiology. Streptococci's ability to adhere to tooth surfaces can be attributed to their production of extracellular polysaccharides (EPS), which allows them to form biofilms and contribute to caries development.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
