["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the volume percentage of filler in dental composite, we need to know that the density of fillers is typically less than that of the polymer matrix. Therefore, a higher weight percentage of filler does not necessarily translate to a higher volume percentage. Since the problem statement mentions 'by weight', we can look for information about the relationship between weight and volume percentages. We don't have any relevant data from the provided documents, but we know that fillers typically have lower densities than polymers. Based on this knowledge, we can infer that the volume percentage of filler is likely to be less than 75%. The closest option is C: 60.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
