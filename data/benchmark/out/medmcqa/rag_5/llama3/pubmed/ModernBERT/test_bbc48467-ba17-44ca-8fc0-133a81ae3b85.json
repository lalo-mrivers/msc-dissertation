["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about an increase in muscle mass at adolescence. The relevant documents mention various hormones like estrogen, prolactin, thyroid hormone, adrenal hormone, and growth hormone. Estrogen replacement therapy does not mention anything about muscle mass or adolescent development. Prolactin's influence on intestinal hypertrophy during lactation is also unrelated to muscle mass. The document 'Can drugs improve memory?' does not provide any information about muscle mass either. However, the document 'Hot flushes during breast feeding?' mentions a pattern similar to menopausal hot flushes, which could be related to hormone regulation. Finally, the document 'Induction of developmental anomalies in mice by maternal stress' suggests that endocrine factors can affect fetal development. Given this information, it is likely that growth hormone is involved in increasing muscle mass at adolescence.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"]
