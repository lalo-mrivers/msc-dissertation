["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the best noninvasive investigation to check for viability of myocardium. The documents provided are related to different medical techniques, but none specifically mention myocardial viability. However, one document mentions retrograde cardioplegia, which could be relevant to cardiac function. Another document discusses receptor-mediated radiopharmaceutical imaging of the liver, but this does not seem directly applicable. A third document describes a method for sampling airway gas, which is unrelated to myocardial viability. The final document is about Merkel cell tumor and its relation to medical imaging techniques, but this too seems irrelevant. Based on these documents, it appears that the best noninvasive investigation to check for viability of myocardium would be an echocardiogram (C), as this is a commonly used technique in cardiology.\", \"answer_choice\": C}"]
