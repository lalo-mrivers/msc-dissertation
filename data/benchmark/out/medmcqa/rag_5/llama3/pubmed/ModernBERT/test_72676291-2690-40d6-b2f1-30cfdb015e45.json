["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the effectiveness of Injection Glucagon for management of persistent hypoglycemia. The relevant documents suggest that sulfonylureas are used to control hyperglycemia and prevent progression from impaired glucose tolerance to diabetes. Gliquidone shows a good blood sugar lowering effect over a wide dose range. This information implies that Injection Glucagon is likely effective for managing hypoglycemia in general. However, the text does not explicitly mention any specific exceptions or contraindications. Therefore, we need to look for conditions that might affect the efficacy of glucagon. Galactosemia and infant of diabetic mother are conditions related to carbohydrate metabolism and could potentially interact with glucagon therapy. Nesidioblastosis is a rare condition characterized by hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia. A large-for-date baby may have different glucose dynamics compared to normal babies, but there is no direct link between fetal macrosomia and glucagon efficacy. Therefore, we can conclude that Injection Glucagon might not be effective for management of persistent hypoglycemia in infants with galactosemia or those born to diabetic mothers.\", \"answer_choice\": D}"]
