["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, we need to calculate the total daily dose of drug X, which is the infusion rate multiplied by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour). Total daily dose = Infusion rate x 60 = 1.6 mg/min x 60 = 96 mg/day. Since the clearance of the drug is 640 mL/min, we can calculate the steady state plasma concentration as follows: Steady state plasma concentration = Total daily dose / Clearance = 96 mg/day / 640 mL/min. We need to convert the units to get a consistent answer in mg/mL. There are 1000 mL in one liter, so 1 mL is equal to 0.001 L. Therefore, we can write the clearance as: Clearance (mL/min) x 60 min/hour = 38400 mL/hour. Now, we can calculate the steady state plasma concentration as follows: Steady state plasma concentration = Total daily dose / Clearance = 96 mg/day / 38400 mL/hour. We need to convert hours to minutes to get a consistent answer in mg/mL. There are 60 minutes in one hour, so we can write the calculation as: Steady state plasma concentration = (96 mg/day / 38400 mL) x (1 hour/60 min). Finally, we can simplify the expression and solve for the steady state plasma concentration.\", \n\"answer_choice\": C"]
