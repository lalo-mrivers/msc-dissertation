["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks which instrument does not have 4 digits. The options are GMT, Excavators, Enamel hatchet, and None. I will analyze the instruments provided and look for one that has a different number of digits. According to the given documents, none of the instruments mentioned in the documents (Goldmann, Topcon, Marco, Rodenstock) have 4 digits. Therefore, I will focus on the other options. GMT is an abbreviation for Greenwich Mean Time, which is not an instrument with a specific number of digits. Excavators and Enamel hatchet are types of machines or tools that typically do not have a specific number of digits associated with them. Based on this analysis, my answer is None.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
