["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has primary amenorrhea with well-developed breasts (Tanner's stage 5) and minimal pubic hair (Tanner's stage 1). The breast development started at the age of 12, which is normal. However, despite taking OCPs for 2 years without effect, suggesting that hormonal balance might not be the issue here. Given her normal stature and being a football player, we can rule out Turner's syndrome as it typically presents with short stature and other characteristic features.
