The case reports 'Experience in the care of a pregnant woman known to be carrying a mongoloid fetus (author's transl)' and 'Born in a caul. Remarkable survival.' are not relevant to this question. However, 'Can we abandon Naegele's rule? A pregnant woman may become anxious if she has not delivered by the date given to her by her physician.' mentions serum unconjugated bilirubin levels. The article does not specify what levels are considered high or normal but it provides a general idea that high levels of serum unconjugated bilirubin can be a problem.\n\nThe 'A differential diagnostic abnormality (?) with regard to diarrhoea in calves (author's transl)' case report is about calf-diarrhoea, which is not relevant to this question.
