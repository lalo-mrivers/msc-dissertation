["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"No relevant documents mention beta 1,3 Glucan test or its results. However, the question asks to identify 'all except' where the test is positive. This suggests that we should look for a pattern or connection between different organisms. Upon examining the documents, we can see that Pta antigen and IgG1 allotype are mentioned in separate contexts. AeiB: A family study does not mention beta 1,3 Glucan test either. Homozygosity of adenylate kinase allele 3: two cases does not seem relevant to this question as well. On the orientation of the Rh: El1 linkage group presents a different genetic context. Based on the information provided, we can make an educated guess that the Beta 1,3 Glucan test is positive in all fungal organisms (aspergillus, candida, mucormycosis) but not in Pneumocystis Jirovecii which is a protozoan.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
