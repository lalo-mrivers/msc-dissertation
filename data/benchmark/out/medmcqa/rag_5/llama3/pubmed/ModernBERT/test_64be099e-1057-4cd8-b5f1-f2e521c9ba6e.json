["{\n    \"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the second messenger for smooth muscle relaxation mediated by NO. Since we are looking at smooth muscle relaxation, it's related to the topic of denervation (in the first document). The document mentions that selective ventricular denervation interrupts alpha-adrenergic coronary vasoconstriction fibers, which means it affects the adrenergic system. In the last document, 'Effect of beta-adrenergic blockade on intramuscular triglyceride mobilization during exercise', we see that the adrenergic system controls mobilization of intramuscular triglyceride during exercise. This suggests a connection to the topic of smooth muscle relaxation. The document does not explicitly state how NO affects cGMP, but it is well-established in literature that nitric oxide (NO) increases cGMP levels, which leads to smooth muscle relaxation.\",\n    \"answer_choice\": C"]
