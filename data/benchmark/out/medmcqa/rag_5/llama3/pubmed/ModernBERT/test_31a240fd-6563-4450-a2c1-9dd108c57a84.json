["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks which of the given options is not used in polymerase chain reaction. The provided documents are about different topics like detecting microbial contamination, basic computer program for endpoint assays, estimating population doubling time and selective methylation. None of these documents discuss polymerase chain reaction. Therefore, we need to rely on our general knowledge or other external sources to answer this question. According to the principles of polymerase chain reaction, it involves DNA template, DNA polymerase, dNTPs (which include dideoxyribonucleotides), primers and Taq polymerase. The option that is not used in polymerase chain reaction is the cell population or doubling time as it is a process for estimating DNA content.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
