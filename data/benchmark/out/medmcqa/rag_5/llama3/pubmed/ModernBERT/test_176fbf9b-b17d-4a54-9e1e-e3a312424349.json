["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the causative organism of lesions on an infant's face and limbs. None of the provided documents mention these specific symptoms or organisms. However, Sudeck's syndrome is a condition characterized by bone resorption and osteoporosis, often following amputation or injury. While it may not be directly related to the question, it does suggest that trauma could be a factor in the development of lesions. Considering the presence of 'face' and 'limbs' in the symptoms, I will rule out Sudeck's syndrome as a primary cause. The other documents do not provide any relevant information about infantile skin lesions or conditions that would directly relate to the question.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
