["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the PPS anatomically. From the given documents, none of them seem to be related to the term 'PPS'. However, one document mentions 'luxatio pedis subtalo', which seems unrelated to the topic as well. Another document discusses penile horn, which is not relevant either. One technical note talks about a modified suction tip, but that's also not connected to PPS. The only other document appears to be a list of important psychologists, which doesn't seem related to anatomy or PPS at all. Therefore, the answer cannot be found in these documents.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
