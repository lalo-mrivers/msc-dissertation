["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about a molecule with permanent dipole. The relevant documents are the ones discussing molecular structures or properties. Among these documents, 'Molecular structure of Q nucleotide' seems to be most relevant as it deals with the structure and analysis of a molecule by X-ray diffraction method. This information can help determine if the molecule has a permanent dipole or not. In this document, the molecule studied is Queuosine 5'-monophosphate (PQ), which is a nucleotide. Nucleotides are molecules that contain nitrogenous bases and have a phosphate group attached to them. Some nucleotides, like guanosine and adenosine, have permanent dipoles due to the presence of partial positive or negative charges on their molecular structure. Based on this information, it is likely that Queuosine 5'-monophosphate (PQ) also has a permanent dipole. Therefore, we can infer that water, which contains nucleotides in its structure, might also have a permanent dipole.\", \"answer_choice\": D}"]
