["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Direct Ophthalmoscopy refers to a non-invasive diagnostic technique that uses a handheld instrument to visualize the internal structures of the eye. The physical principles behind this method are different from those discussed in [Selected promising radiological imaging techniques (author's transl)], which focuses on computerized axial tomography. As there is no mention of Direct Ophthalmoscopy in this paper, we must consider other relevant documents. Neither [Burkitt's lymphoma] nor [An equipment logging system] seem directly related to Direct Ophthalmoscopy. [Autolok band] discusses retinal detachment and [Achievements, problems and prospects of hand surgery] is about hand surgery, neither of which are relevant to this topic. The characteristics of Direct Ophthalmoscopy can be found in various medical resources. According to these sources, images obtained with this method are indeed visual and erect (A), the field of vision is much wider than 2 disk diameters (B), magnification is not a characteristic of Direct Ophthalmoscopy as it does not involve optical enlargement (C), and the device itself does not require external illumination as it uses the natural reflection from the eye (D). Therefore, the correct statement is that Direct Ophthalmoscopy is self-illuminated (D).\", \"answer_choice\": D}"]
