["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the release of vasoactive amine to increase vascular permeability. The relevant document that comes close to this description is [Are anticholinergic effects responsible for the heterogeneous quinidine-induced modifications of heart muscle refractoriness?]. It talks about vagal tone being responsible for the heterogeneous reactivity of atrial and ventricular contractile tissues to quinidine, which may make atrial cells more sensitive to the effects of quinidine. This does not seem directly related to vasoactive amine release. The next relevant document is [The effect of ADP on platelet metabolism in vitro.-III-]. It talks about rat's megakaryocytes in vitro and ADP-induced apparent platelets protrusion, which does not mention anything about vascular permeability or vasoactive amines. Then we have [Reflex mechanism for maintaining magnesium homeostasis], which describes the reflex magnesiuretic response by changing tubular processes in the kidneys after local stimulation of the liver with MgC12 solution in unanesthetized dogs. This does not seem related to vascular permeability or vasoactive amines either. The last relevant document is [Active control of intracellular pH], which talks about squid giant axon and acid extrusion, but this seems unrelated as well. Therefore, we are left with the last option, [Effect of obsidan on some mechanisms of the heart productivity regulation]. It does not seem to have any direct relevance to the question either. Lastly, there is no mention of anticholinergic effects responsible for heterogeneous quinidine-induced modifications of heart muscle refractoriness being related to vascular permeability or vasoactive amines.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
