["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks which amino acid has a positive charge at physiological pH. To determine this, we need to look at the pKa values of each amino acid. The pKa value represents the pH at which an amino acid is 50% charged. For positively charged amino acids, this means they are fully charged at physiological pH (pH 7.4). A quick review of the relevant documents shows that Arginine has a high pKa value of around 12.5, indicating it remains positively charged at physiological pH.\", \"answer_choice\": C}"]
