["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the complications that can occur in a newborn of a diabetic mother. From the provided documents, we can see that there are cases discussed where the mother has diabetes and pregnancy related complications, such as cardiac deformities leading to death (Friedreich's disease). However, none of these specific cases mention hyperglycemia, hypocalcemia or hypomagnesemia as complications in the newborn. The closest scenario is the one described in 'Caudal regression, constrained position of the fetus in utero, maternal prediabetes' where the mother has borderline values in glucose tolerance test, but no specific complications are mentioned in the newborn. Therefore, based on the available information, it seems that hyperbilirubinemia is the most plausible answer.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
