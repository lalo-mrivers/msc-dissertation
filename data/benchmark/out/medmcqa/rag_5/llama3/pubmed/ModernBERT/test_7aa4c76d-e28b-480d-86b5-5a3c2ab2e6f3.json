["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about a 24-year-old college student who injured his right knee while playing hockey. The patient presents with instability of the knee joint at full extension (0 degrees) without instability at 90 degrees flexion. This information suggests that the injury is related to the posterior cruciate ligament (PCL), as PCL injuries often cause instability in extension and flexion. However, it's also important to consider other possibilities such as a meniscal tear or an ACL (anterior cruciate ligament) injury. The fact that the patient has no instability at 90 degrees flexion makes an isolated ACL injury less likely.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C\n}"]
