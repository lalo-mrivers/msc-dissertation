["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To calculate the absolute risk reduction (ARR) and relative risk (RR), we need to analyze the results of the clinical trial. First, let's identify the number of patients who developed HT complications in both groups: Control group (old drug): 180 out of 15225 = 1.18% Intervention group (new drug): 16 out of 15225 = 0.11%. Next, we calculate the ARR by subtracting the proportion of patients who did not develop HT complications in the control group from those in the intervention group: ARR = 1.07% - 0.10% = 0.97%. To calculate the RR, we divide the proportion of patients who developed HT complications in the intervention group by that in the control group: RR = 0.11% / 1.18% â‰ˆ 0.093 or approximately 9.3%.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
