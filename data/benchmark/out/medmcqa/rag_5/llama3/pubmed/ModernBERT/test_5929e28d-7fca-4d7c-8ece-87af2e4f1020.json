["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about tooth structure cutting being preceded by crack propagation due to tensile forces. The provided documents don't specifically discuss tooth structure cutting or tensile forces. However, the document '[Esthetic restorations and occlusal stress]' mentions reconstructions on conoid, abraded and fractured elements made using an hybrid composite with excellent results functionally or aesthetically. This suggests that fracture can occur due to tensile forces. Additionally, 'Cement line motion in bone' discusses the deformation of compact bovine bone subjected to constant torsional load for long periods of time, which is not directly related to tooth structure cutting. The remaining documents discuss different topics such as electromyography and detector calibration.\n\nBased on this information, I infer that the correct answer refers to a type of fracture caused by tensile forces.\", \n\"answer_choice\": D"]
