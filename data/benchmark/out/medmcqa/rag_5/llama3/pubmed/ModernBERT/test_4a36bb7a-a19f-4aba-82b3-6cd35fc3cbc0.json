["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about periradicular surgery, which is a minimally invasive procedure used to treat various types of pain originating from the spine. The goal is to identify the instrument used to remove bone during this procedure. The relevant documents do not provide direct information about periradicular surgery. However, we can look for similar procedures in the provided texts that may involve bone removal. For example, a technique described in 'Coagulum pyelolithotomy using autogenous plasma and bovine thrombin' mentions removing calculi lying loose in the renal pelvis or infundibula, which could involve some bone removal. In this context, it is reasonable to assume that the same instruments used for similar procedures would be applicable. A round burr is commonly used in dental procedures such as third molar removal, as seen in 'Swelling and trismus after third molar removal'. The similarity between these procedures suggests that a round burr could also be used during periradicular surgery to remove bone.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
