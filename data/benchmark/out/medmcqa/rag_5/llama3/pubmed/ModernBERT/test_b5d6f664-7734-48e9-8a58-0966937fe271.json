["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"I'm looking through the provided documents for non-synovial joints with connective tissue between the bones. The first document talks about reconstruction of the oral mucocutaneous junction, which doesn't seem relevant. The second document discusses herniation in the falciform ligament, but it's not a joint. The third document is about lateral dislocation of the elbow, which could be a non-synovial joint, but it doesn't specify what type.
