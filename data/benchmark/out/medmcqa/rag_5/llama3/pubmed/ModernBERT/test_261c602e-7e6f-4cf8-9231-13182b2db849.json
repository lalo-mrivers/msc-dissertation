["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about propagated nerve action potential. I will go through each option to see which one fits best.\\r\\nOption A: Decremental - This term refers to the decrease in amplitude of an action potential as it propagates along a neuron, but it's not directly related to propagated nerve action potentials.\\r\\nOption B: Not affected by hypoxia - Hypoxia is a condition where there is low oxygen levels. Propagated nerve action potentials are slowed or blocked under hypoxic conditions.\\r\\nOption C: Fastest in C fibers - This option is incorrect as the speed of propagation is different for each type of fiber, but fastest in A-delta and A-beta fibers.\\r\\nOption D: Not affected by membrane capacitance - The capacitance of a neuron's membrane affects the rate of change of the voltage across it, which plays a crucial role in propagated nerve action potentials.\", \"answer_choice\": B}"]
