["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the mobility of sickle cell hemoglobin (HbS) on gel electrophoresis after a point mutation that replaces glutamic acid with valine. From the given documents, we know that HbS is characterized by replacement of arginine by glycine at alpha 141(HC3). This change affects the conformation and polarity of the molecule, making it different from normal hemoglobin. However, there is no information about the specific point mutation replacing glutamic acid with valine. Nevertheless, we can analyze the structural changes described in the documents that are relevant to HbS mobility. The document [Structural peculiarities of protein typical of G-myelomas] describes how the surrounding of tyrosine and tryptophane residua is more polar for G-myeloma proteins compared to donor immunoglobulin G, suggesting a different conformation. The document Oxygenation properties of hemoglobin variants with substitutions near the polyphosphate binding site discusses how substitutions at beta 79 and beta 80 affect oxygen affinity but not response to organic phosphates, which may affect mobility on gel electrophoresis.\n\nSince there is no specific information about the point mutation replacing glutamic acid with valine, we will focus on the general trends observed in HbS. The documents suggest that HbS has a different conformation and polarity compared to normal hemoglobin, which might affect its mobility on gel electrophoresis. Therefore, it is likely that the mobility of HbS will be changed, but the exact direction (increased or decreased) depends on various factors such as the specific point mutation and the electrophoresis conditions.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
