["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the provided documents, we can see that metal ceramics are mentioned as an optical solution for fixed partial dentures. The document '[Effective methods for the production of esthetically satisfactory fixed partial dentures]' specifically mentions aluminum-oxide profile components in metal ceramics. This suggests that metal oxides are added to porcelain to provide a specific benefit. Based on this information, we can eliminate options B and C as they are not directly related to adding metal oxides to porcelain. Option A 'Strength' is also unlikely as it would not be mentioned specifically in the context of esthetically satisfactory fixed partial dentures. Therefore, the most likely answer is that metal oxides are added to provide D: Impart colour.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
