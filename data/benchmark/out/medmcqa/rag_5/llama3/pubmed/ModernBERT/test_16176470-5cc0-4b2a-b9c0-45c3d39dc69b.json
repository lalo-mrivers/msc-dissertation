["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the muscles of mastication. These muscles are involved in the process of chewing food. The relevant documents provided do not mention anything directly related to the muscles of mastication or their blood supply. However, we can look for any information on the blood supply of the head and neck region, which may help us identify the correct answer.
