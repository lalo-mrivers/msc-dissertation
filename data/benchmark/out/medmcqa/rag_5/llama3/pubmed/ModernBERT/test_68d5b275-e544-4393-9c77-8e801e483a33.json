["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about a type of reaction where antigens combine with antibodies already attached to the surface of mast cells and basophils. From the given documents, it seems that the binding of anti-human immunoglobulins to human epidermal cells (document 4) might be related to this as it shows the binding of anti-IgE and IgM immunoglobulins to human skin scrapings. However, document 1 talks about bovine immunoglobulins, which is different from the context of this question. Document 2 discusses chemotaxis by soluble immune complexes, but it does not directly relate to the combination of antigens with antibodies on mast cells and basophils. Document 3 talks about cross-linking of surface Ig and actin, which seems unrelated to the given context. Based on the provided information, the most relevant phenomenon is the binding of anti-human immunoglobulins to human epidermal cells.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
