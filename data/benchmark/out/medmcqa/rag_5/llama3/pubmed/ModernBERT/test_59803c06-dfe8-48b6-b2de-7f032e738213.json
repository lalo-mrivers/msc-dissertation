["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about muscle spindles, which are specialized sensory organs within muscles that detect changes in muscle length and velocity. The central zone of a muscle spindle has no actin and myosin (based on the paper [A new method in plastic surgery for the correction of the lip red in bilateral labial clefts], which does not discuss muscle spindles). Type 1 nuclear bag fibers have low myosin ATPase activity, as stated in the relevant documents. The peripheral zone of a muscle spindle also has no actin and myosin. Finally, type 2 nuclear bag fibers have high levels of myosin ATPase activity (again, based on the provided papers).\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
