["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"No relevant information on IDL (Intermediate Density Lipoprotein) fate is provided in the given documents. However, we can make an educated guess based on the related information available.\\nThe document 'Normalizing effects of S-methylmethionine (vitamin U) on lipoprotein disorder in rats' talks about VLDL, LDL, and HDL. It suggests that vitamin U can normalize the decreased HDL and increased LDL levels in dietary-induced hyperlipidemic rats.\\nThis information is unrelated to IDL fate. Therefore, we need to look for other clues.\\nIn the document 'Studies on the late-pre-beta-lipoprotein of human serum', VLDL is mentioned with a raised VLDL cholesterol to triglyceride ratio. This could imply that some portion of IDL might be related to VLDL. However, there is no specific information provided about IDL.\\nThe other documents do not provide any relevant information about IDL fate.\\nBased on the available information, we can only make an educated guess that 50% of IDL might be taken up by liver (similarly to how VLDL might interact with the liver).\\nThis is purely speculative and lacks direct evidence.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
