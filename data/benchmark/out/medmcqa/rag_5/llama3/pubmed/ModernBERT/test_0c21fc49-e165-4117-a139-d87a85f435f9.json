["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"After reviewing the provided documents, I noticed that none of the documents seem to be related to statistical tests or methodology. However, upon closer inspection, I found a reference to 'triangular contingency table' and 'parametrised model' in the document titled 'Quasi-independent triangular contingency tables'. This suggests that the test might be related to categorical data analysis. Furthermore, I found a mention of 'multiple choice questions' in another document which seems unrelated. The last two documents seem to be focused on medical topics like bacteric identification and rectal duplication. Given this information, I am going to focus on the 'Quasi-independent triangular contingency tables' document to find the answer.\", \"answer_choice\": C}"]
