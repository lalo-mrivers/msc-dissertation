["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"There is no relevant information about β-oxidation of odd-chain fatty acids in the provided documents. However, we can consider the general mechanism of β-oxidation which involves steps such as acyl-CoA formation, NAD+ and CoA consumption, and production of FADH2 and Acetyl-CoA. Based on this knowledge, we can expect that the β-oxidation of odd-chain fatty acids would also produce Acetyl-CoA.\", \"answer_choice\": C}"]
