["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, it is clear that this question is referring to a specific dental restoration scenario. The key information comes from the document 'Effects of cement bases on the stresses in amalgam restorations'. This study used a computerized dental model to simulate various types of cement bases supporting an amalgam restoration. It found that under the same load, the maximum tensile stresses and deflections increased at least threefold when using a zinc oxide-eugenol (ZOE) base compared to a ZnPO4 cement base. Therefore, it is logical to conclude that ZOE has a lower modulus of elasticity than ZnPO4.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
