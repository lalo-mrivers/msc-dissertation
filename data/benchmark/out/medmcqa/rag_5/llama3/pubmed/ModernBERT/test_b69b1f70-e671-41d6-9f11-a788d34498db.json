["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about amino acids that do not undergo post-translational modification. Post-translational modification refers to the addition of functional groups or molecules to an amino acid after its translation from mRNA into a protein sequence. The given options are all modified forms of amino acids, except for one that is a naturally occurring amino acid. Hydroxy-proline and hydroxy-lysine are both modified forms of proline and lysine, respectively. Triiodothyronine is not an amino acid at all, but rather a hormone. Selenocysteine is the 21st amino acid and is incorporated into proteins through a specific mechanism. It does not undergo post-translational modification. Therefore, Selenocysteine is the correct answer.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
