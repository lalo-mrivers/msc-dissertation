["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the safest and effective gutta percha solvent among the given options. We can start by looking at the relevant documents provided. In 'Chloroform or ether - a literary question', Thackeray's accurate knowledge of the pharmacology of chloroform is considered, which implies that chloroform has been used in medicine before. In 'Influence of lipophilic substances on fungal infections of the human skin', it is mentioned that chloroform-methanol (2:1 v/v) was found to be substantially superior to acetone or diethyl ether for lipid extraction from the back of human volunteers. This suggests that chloroform has some solvent properties. In 'Structure-activity correlations for acaricidal hydrazones', there is no direct mention of chloroform as a gutta percha solvent. In '[Alginate with a chlorhexidine admixture in a torsion test]', chlorhexidin is mentioned, but not chloroform. Finally, in '[Effect of prolonged nicotinic acid load on the tolbutamide test]', there is no mention of gutta percha solvents at all.\n\nGiven this information, we can conclude that chloroform has been used in medicine before and has solvent properties. Therefore, it seems like a reasonable choice as a gutta percha solvent. Among the given options, B: Chloroform appears to be the safest and effective gutta percha solvent.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
