["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"This question is asking about the marker that appears last in a myocardial infarction (MI). The options provided are enzymes and proteins that are commonly used as biomarkers for MI. LDH is a enzyme that is typically elevated early after an MI, CPK-MB is a subunit of creatine kinase that is specific to cardiac muscle and peaks around 24 hours after an MI. Troponin T and I are cardiac-specific troponins that are sensitive and specific markers of MI and peak later than LDH and CPK-MB. Based on the timing of their elevation, Troponin T appears to be the marker that appears last in an MI.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
