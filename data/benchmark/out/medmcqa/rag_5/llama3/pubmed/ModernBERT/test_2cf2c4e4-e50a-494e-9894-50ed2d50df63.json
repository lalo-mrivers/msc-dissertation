["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the strength of association between a risk factor and disease. The relevant documents mention logistic regression models, multiple logistic regression software, and measures of interaction such as relative excess risk due to interaction and synergy index.

Considering the options, I think C: Odds ratio/Relative risk is a common measure of association used in logistic regression models.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
