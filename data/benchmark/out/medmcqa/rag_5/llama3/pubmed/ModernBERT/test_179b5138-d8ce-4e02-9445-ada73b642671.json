["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about a technique based on RNA. The provided options are PCR, Sanger's technique, Next generation sequencing, and Western blot. Based on the information, PCR is a technique that amplifies DNA sequences by using primers to initiate replication. It does not specifically involve RNA. Sanger's technique is a method for sequencing DNA molecules. It also does not directly involve RNA. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) is a high-throughput technology used for DNA sequencing. While it may potentially involve RNA, the question is asking about a specific technique based on RNA. Western blot is an electrophoresis technique used to detect proteins in a sample. It also does not specifically involve RNA.\n\nThe article that discusses Burkitt's lymphoma and Locus of control among alcoholics do not provide any information about techniques related to RNA. The articles 'A bird's eye view of occupational medicine' and 'Home or hospital? That life begins at home is the desire of most women, and the fear of most obstetricians.' are unrelated to RNA.\n\nThe only technique that involves RNA is PCR which does not involve amplifying RNA. Therefore, the correct answer must be based on RNA.\n\nThe article 'Nurse mobility and employment patterns' also does not provide any information about techniques related to RNA.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
