["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about CPR technique statements. The first statement says Czan can be given irrespective of rib fracture. However, there are no documents provided that mention anything about Czan or rib fractures related to CPR. Therefore, it's difficult to determine the truthfulness of this statement. Statements 2 and 3 relate to adult and infant chest compression ratios respectively, but these statements don't seem directly connected to the provided documents.
