["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has a history of myocardial infarction and elevated triglycerides. HDL cholesterol is relatively low at 32 mg/dL, which suggests that the patient may have atherosclerotic risk factors. LDL cholesterol is elevated at 126 mg/dL, indicating a need for statin therapy. Fenofibrate can be used to treat hypertriglyceridemia and mixed dyslipidemia. Rosuvastatin is a potent statin that can effectively lower LDL cholesterol.
