["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the treatment of a fractured maxillary central incisor with no periapical lesion. Since there's no response from the pulp and no periapical lesion, it suggests that the tooth has become non-vital. The main concern is to prevent further damage or complications.\n\nRoot canal treatment is the most appropriate option considering the symptoms and findings. This is because the tooth has already lost its vitality, so a conventional root canal treatment would be necessary to remove any infected pulp tissue and prevent further infection.\n\nThe other options are not suitable in this scenario:\n\n* Ca(OH)2 pulp capping: This procedure is used for treating vital teeth with a small crack or cavity. Since the tooth has no response, it's non-vital and requires root canal treatment.\n* Formocresol pulpotomy: Similar to pulp capping, this procedure is used for treating vital teeth. The tooth in question is non-vital and needs conventional root canal treatment.\n* Complete debridement and apexification: This option would be suitable if the goal was to preserve the apical seal of the tooth, but it's not necessary in this case since there's no periapical lesion.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate treatment choice is conventional root canal treatment.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
