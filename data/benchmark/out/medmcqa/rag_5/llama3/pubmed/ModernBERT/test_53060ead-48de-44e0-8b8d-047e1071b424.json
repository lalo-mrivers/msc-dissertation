["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking which of the options is NOT a small round cell tumor. Small round cell tumors are characterized by their histopathological features, including cytology, growth patterns, and immune responses. The provided documents do not mention any information about hemangiosarcoma's histopathological features. However, they do discuss Kaposi's sarcoma and Burkitt's lymphoma, both of which are mentioned as small round cell tumors in other texts.\n\nThe literature suggests that hemangiosarcoma is a vascular neoplasm with distinct cytogenetic and morphological features.
