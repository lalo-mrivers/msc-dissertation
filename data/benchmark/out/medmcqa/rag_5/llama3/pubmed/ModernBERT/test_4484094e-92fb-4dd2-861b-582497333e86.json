["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about preventing cross infection in a post-operative intensive care unit where five patients developed post-operative wound infections on the same wound. The key phrase here is 'post-operative wound infection', which suggests that we are dealing with surgical site infections (SSIs) rather than other types of infections. SSIs are typically caused by bacterial contamination during surgery or through poor wound care practices.\n\nWe can rule out option A because giving antibiotics to all other patients in the ward would not prevent cross infection, and it could even contribute to antibiotic resistance.\n\nOption B, fumigating the ward, is also unlikely to be effective as fumigation is typically used to control airborne pathogens like tuberculosis, rather than skin infections.\n\nDisinfecting the ward with sodium hypochlorite (option C) might provide some level of disinfection, but it would not specifically address the issue of cross infection on the same wound. It's also important to note that overuse of disinfectants can lead to resistance and other issues.\n\nThe most effective method to prevent cross infection would be to practice proper hand washing (option D). This is because hand hygiene is a critical component of preventing SSIs, as it reduces the risk of bacterial contamination during surgery or post-operative care. Proper hand washing has been consistently shown to reduce SSI rates in multiple studies.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
