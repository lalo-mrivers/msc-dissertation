["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the oxygen carrying capacity of an 18-year-old patient with a hemoglobin of 14 g/dL, we need to consider the relationship between hemoglobin and oxygen carrying capacity. The provided documents do not directly address this topic. However, we can infer that the rate of auto-oxidation of human hemoglobin to methemoglobin is influenced by oxygen tension. This suggests that the oxygen carrying capacity may be affected by the partial pressure of oxygen. Unfortunately, there are no specific data on the relationship between hemoglobin and oxygen carrying capacity in an 18-year-old patient or under different oxygen tensions.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
