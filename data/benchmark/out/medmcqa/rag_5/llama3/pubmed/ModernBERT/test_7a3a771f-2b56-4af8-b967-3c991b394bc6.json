["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, it can be inferred that Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) has reliable anticoagulant action because it is less protein bound. This is evident from the first document [Prophylaxis of thromboembolism using low dosage heparin] which mentions that 'low dosage-Heparin' is a promising line for prophylaxis of thromboembolism, implying that it has anticoagulant properties. Additionally, the fact that it's less protein bound suggests that it can more easily interact with its target proteins to exert its anticoagulant effects.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
