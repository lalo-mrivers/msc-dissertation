["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To calculate the anion gap, we need to first determine the total serum concentration of sodium (Na+) and chloride (Cl-). Given: Na+ 137, K+4, Urea 54, Bicarbonate 15, Phosphate 3, Chloride 110. The total concentration of cations is 137 + 4 = 141 mmol/L. The total concentration of anions is 54 (urea) + 15 (bicarbonate) + 3 (phosphate) + 110 (chloride) = 182 mmol/L. Now, we can calculate the anion gap by subtracting the sum of non-bicarbonate buffering anions (urea, phosphate, and chloride) from the total anion concentration.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
