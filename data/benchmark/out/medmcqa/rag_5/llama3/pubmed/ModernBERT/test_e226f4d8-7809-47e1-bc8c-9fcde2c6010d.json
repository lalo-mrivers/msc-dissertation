["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking which option is not true about phenotype. Phenotype refers to the physical characteristics of an individual, such as eye color or height. The passage of time does not modify a person's phenotype, so this is the incorrect statement. Genetic sequence is another term for genotype, and genotype influences phenotype, but these are different concepts. Therefore, options A, D, and C are all related to phenotype and are correct statements. Only option B accurately describes phenotype.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
