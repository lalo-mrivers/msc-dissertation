["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the type of study this is, I'll review the characteristics of each option. Option A, Ecological, typically involves analyzing data from a population or group to understand trends or patterns. This aligns with the description of the study, which records sale of an anti-asthma drug and measures asthma-related deaths over 15 years. However, the study doesn't specifically follow individuals or groups over time. Option B, Case reference, is not applicable as it typically involves comparing outcomes between two distinct groups. Option C, Experimental, also doesn't apply as there's no controlled intervention being tested. Finally, option D, Psephology, refers to the study of elections and voting patterns, which isn't relevant here. Therefore, based on these characteristics, I conclude that this study is Ecological.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
