["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"No relevant documents mention the zygomatic process of maxilla or its attachment. However, we can consider the structures surrounding the maxilla. The relevant document '[About the face value of the cleft of the articulus mandibulae (author's transl)]' discusses the mandibular joints and the planimetry of negative replicas on the mandibular joints from older men. This doesn't provide direct information about the zygomatic process of maxilla. The other documents discuss rare variations of arteries, anonychia with ectrodactyly, intracorneal sutures, and intra-osseous vascularization of the astragalus. None of these documents mention the attachment of muscles to the zygomatic process of maxilla.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
