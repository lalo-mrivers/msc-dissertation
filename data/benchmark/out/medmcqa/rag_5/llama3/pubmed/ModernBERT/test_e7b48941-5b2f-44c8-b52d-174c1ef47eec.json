["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, we can see that they are a mix of articles from different medical fields such as dentistry, obstetrics, and optics. The question asks about non-working contact needed in all except. From the options, we have A: Natural dentition, B: Complete denture, C: Distal extension RPDs, and D: None. We can analyze each option to see if it requires a working contact or not. Option A, natural dentition, does not require a non-working contact. Similarly, option B, complete denture, also does not need a non-working contact. However, options C and D are related to dental prosthetics, which may require a non-working contact. Therefore, we can conclude that non-working contact is needed in all except A (Natural dentition) and B (Complete denture).\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
