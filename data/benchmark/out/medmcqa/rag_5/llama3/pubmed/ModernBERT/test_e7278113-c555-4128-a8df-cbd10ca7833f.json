["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is administered a drug with first-order kinetics. We are given that 75mg of the drug is eliminated from the body in 90 minutes. To find the amount of drug remaining after 6 hours, we need to calculate the elimination rate constant (k). Since the drug follows first-order kinetics, the elimination rate is proportional to the concentration of the drug.\n\nThe formula for first-order kinetics is: Amount = Amount0 * e^(-kt)\n\nwhere Amount0 is the initial dose (200mg), t is time (6 hours), and k is the elimination rate constant.\n\nWe can rearrange this formula to solve for k:\n\nk = -ln( Amount / Amount0) / t\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nk = -ln(125/200) / 6\n\nk ≈ 0.0571/hour\n\nNow that we have the elimination rate constant, we can use it to find the amount of drug remaining after 6 hours:\n\nAmount = 200 * e^(-0.0571*6)\n\nAmount ≈ 25 mg\",\n\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
