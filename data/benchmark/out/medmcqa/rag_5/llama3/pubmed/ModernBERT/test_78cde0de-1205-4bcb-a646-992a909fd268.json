["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for the neonatal mortality rate. The neonatal mortality rate is calculated as the number of neonatal deaths per 1000 live births. Given the data provided, we have: number of neonatal deaths = 450, number of stillbirths = 212, total number of live births = 12,450. We need to exclude the stillbirths from the total number of live births because they are not included in the neonatal mortality rate calculation. So, the relevant number of live births is: 12,450 - 212 = 12,238. Now, we can calculate the neonatal mortality rate as follows: (number of neonatal deaths / total number of live births) * 1000.\",\n\"answer_choice\": A\n}"]
