["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the relation between the variance of diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and vitamin D, we need to compare their standard deviations. The SD for DBP is 11 mm Hg, while the SD for vitamin D is 3 ng/ml. Since the units are different, we cannot directly compare them. However, if we express all values in the same unit, such as milliliters per hour (since both values have a magnitude of 10-100), we can see that the SD for DBP is approximately 3.5 times larger than the SD for vitamin D. This suggests that the variance of DBP is greater than 4 times the variance of vitamin D.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
