["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Acetazolamide is a non-competitive inhibitor of carbonic anhydrase enzyme. This means it doesn't bind to the active site of the enzyme but rather binds to another part of the enzyme and prevents it from functioning. A non-competitive inhibitor typically decreases the Vmax without affecting the Km. Therefore, the correct answer would be D: No change in Vmax.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
