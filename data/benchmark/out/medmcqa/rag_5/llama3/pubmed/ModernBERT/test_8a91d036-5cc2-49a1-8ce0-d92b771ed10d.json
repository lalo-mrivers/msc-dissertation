["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about detecting pain by stimulating specific nerve fibers. The provided documents mention the silent period in pure sensory neuronopathy, which implies the activation of smaller, slower conducting fibers (C fibres). Additionally, the document on sympathetic reflex responses mentions A and A+C afferent fibers evoking a three-phasic change of activity, which is likely related to nociceptive stimulation. The document on inhibition of flexor reflexes in patients with complete spinal cord lesion suggests that C fibre activation can induce inhibitory effects on flexors.\n\nThe documents do not directly mention the specific nerve fibers stimulated for pulp hyperemia or reversible pulpitis. However, based on the provided information and the concept of nociceptive stimulation, it is reasonable to assume that A delta fibres are activated in both conditions.\n\nAnother document mentions superficially anaesthetized and unanaesthetized decerebrate cats, which is not directly relevant to the question but could be used to infer the activation of specific nerve fibers. The document on pontine versus medullary neurones during swallowing does not provide any information related to pain detection or pulp hyperemia.\n\nThe last document mentions powerful electric stimuli and their effects on nervous impulses, which is also unrelated to the question.\n\nBased on this step-by-step thinking, it appears that A delta fibres are likely stimulated in reversible pulpitis and pulp hyperemia.\", \n\"answer_choice\": C"]
