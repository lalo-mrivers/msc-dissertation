["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with vaginal itching and green frothy genital discharge. Strawberry vagina is seen on examination, which suggests a yeast infection, likely caused by Candida species.

Amoxicillin is also an antibiotic and not directly related to treating a yeast infection.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
