["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the capillary oncotic pressure required for a net filtration pressure of 3 mm Hg, we need to consider the interstitial hydrostatic pressure (2 mm Hg), interstitial oncotic pressure (7 mm Hg), and capillary hydrostatic pressure (25 mm Hg). The Starling equation relates these pressures: ΔP = (PC - Pi) + (Pc - Pn), where ΔP is the net filtration pressure, PC is the capillary oncotic pressure, Pi is the interstitial oncotic pressure, Pc is the capillary hydrostatic pressure, and Pn is the interstitial hydrostatic pressure. We are given: Pn = 2 mm Hg, Pi = 7 mm Hg, and Pc = 25 mm Hg. Rearranging the equation to solve for PC, we get: PC = (ΔP + Pi + Pn) - Pc. Substituting the values, we get: PC = (3 + 7 + 2) - 25 = 12 - 25 = 13 mm Hg.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
