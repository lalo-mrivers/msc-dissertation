["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the detachment of myosin head from actin. The relevant document is 'Evidence for biased bidirectional polymerization of actin filaments using heavy meromyosin prepared by an improved method.' This document discusses the addition of actin monomers to either end of isolated actin filaments decorated with HMM. There is a bias toward addition at one end, which is normally attached to the Z line in striated muscle. No information is provided about calcium entry into sarcoplasmic reticulum, troponin C configuration, ATP binding, or ADP and Pi release. Therefore, detachment of myosin head from actin must be caused by something not mentioned.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
