["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the microscopic examination of chromosomes' shape, size, and arrangement. The relevant documents provide information on chromosome structures and techniques used to study them. Scanning-electron microscopy is a technique that allows high-resolution topological examination of chromosomal aberrations. Karyotyping involves studying the number, size, shape, and arrangement of chromosomes. Since the question focuses on the microscopic examination of these characteristics, karyotyping is the most relevant technique.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
