["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about a 2-day-old neonate with seizures. The first thought is to consider possible causes of seizures in newborns. One common cause is hypoglycemia (low blood sugar). Therefore, it would be important to rule out any underlying metabolic issues. None of the given options directly address this concern. However, CT Head and MRI brain are both imaging modalities that could potentially identify structural abnormalities or injuries that may have contributed to seizures. Transcranial ultrasound is not a typical investigation for newborns with seizures. X-ray would be unlikely to show any relevant information. Therefore, based on the likely causes of seizures in this age group and the available investigations, CT Head seems like the most appropriate next step.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
