["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the effects of fluoridation on dental caries. The first document states that fluoridation reduces DFS (dental surfaces) by 0.29 surfaces per year. This suggests a consistent and significant reduction in caries experience over time. The second document notes that the anti-caries effect of fluoride is diminished if soluble calcium salts are present, which may impact the effectiveness of toothpaste containing fluoride. However, this does not directly apply to the child's situation since we're considering drinking water fluoridation. The third and fourth documents describe studies on the effects of fluoridation in Basel, Switzerland, showing a statistically significant reduction in caries frequency and experience over time. These studies do not specifically address the child's situation, but they suggest that fluoridation can lead to a reduced incidence of dental caries.\n\nGiven this information, it's reasonable to assume that the child would have experienced some level of protection from dental caries during their 8 years in the area with fluoridated water. The question asks about the specific teeth affected, which is an important consideration.\n\nThe relevant document describing how fluoridation affects adult dental caries states that 'each year of exposure to fluoridated water reduced DFS by 0.29 surfaces.' This suggests a cumulative effect over time. Since the child spent 8 years in the area with fluoridated water, it's likely that this cumulative effect would have some impact on their dental caries experience.\n\nConsidering the types of teeth mentioned, we can infer that the primary teeth are typically lost or replaced by permanent teeth around age 6-12. The document describing how fluoridation affects adult dental caries doesn't specifically address primary teeth, but it does suggest a consistent reduction in DFS over time. Given this information, it's possible that some level of protection from dental caries would have been experienced by the child during their 8 years in the area with fluoridated water.\n\nThe question asks about which types of teeth were affected, and we can deduce that all permanent teeth (except third molars) would have been exposed to fluoridated water for some portion of their development. This is important since the first document suggests a pre-eruptive benefit from fluoridation, implying that the developing tooth itself may be protected from caries by fluoride exposure.\n\nBased on this reasoning, it's likely that all permanent teeth (except third molars) would have been affected by the fluoridation, as they would have developed during the 8 years the child spent in the area with fluoridated water.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
