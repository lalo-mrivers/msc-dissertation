["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about Patellar cluck syndrome which is interposition of soft tissue at or hyperophied scar. Based on the provided documents, there are no mentions of patella or femoral components, suggesting that this may not be directly related to any of the described procedures or conditions. However, we can try to eliminate options based on what is known about the patella and its movement. Patellar cluck syndrome refers to interposition of soft tissue at or hyperophied scar. The patella moves in a gliding motion along the femur during flexion (knee bending) and extension (knee straightening). This information can be used to eliminate options, as impinging on the femoral component during extension would require a superior pole of the patella which is not compatible with the described syndrome. Similarly, impinging on the femoral component during flexion would require an inferior pole of the patella also incompatible with Patellar cluck syndrome.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
