["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about idiosyncratic side-effects of carbamazepine. Let's look at the relevant documents: none of them directly mention carbamazepine or its side-effects. However, we can try to find similar information that might be relevant. For instance, [Anticonvulsant nature of marihuana smoking] mentions the use of phenobarbital and diphenylhydantoin in conjunction with marihuana smoking for controlling seizures, which suggests that these medications may have side-effects. [Theophylline 7-substitutes. III. Arylderivatives] does not seem relevant to this question. [Central effects of thyrotropin-releasing factor (TRF)] also seems unrelated. Finally, [Tilidine as an analgesic in combination anesthesia] is about the use of Tilidine as an analgesic and does not provide information on side-effects.\n\nLooking at the options, we can see that A: Steven-Johnson syndrome, B: Agranulocytosis are both severe allergic reactions which could be idiosyncratic side-effects. C: Rash is a possible side-effect of many medications, including anticonvulsants like carbamazepine. D: Blurred vision is not typically an idiosyncratic side-effect of carbamazepine.\n\nConsidering these points, the correct answer should be one that is not a severe allergic reaction and not specifically mentioned as a possible side-effect of carbamazepine. Therefore, I will choose option D: Blurred vision.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
