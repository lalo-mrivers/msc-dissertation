["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the 95% confidence interval (CI) for an estimated prevalence of 10% and a sample size of 100. Since there are no relevant documents provided that directly address this question, we need to use general knowledge about confidence intervals. A common formula for calculating a confidence interval is: CI = P ± Z * sqrt(P*(1-P)/n). We know the estimated prevalence (P) is 10%, and the sample size (n) is 100. To find the 95% CI, we need to find the value of Z that corresponds to a two-tailed probability of 0.025 (since we're looking for a 95% CI). Using a standard normal distribution table or calculator, we find that Z = 1.96. Plugging in the values, we get: CI = 10 ± 1.96 * sqrt(0.1*(1-0.1)/100) ≈ 9.3-10.7.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
