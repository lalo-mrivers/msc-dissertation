["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Anodontia refers to the congenital absence of teeth. The question asks about the effect on growth of Anodontia. Upon reviewing the provided documents, there is no information related to the growth of teeth or dental structures. However, one document mentions ectrodactyly, which is a congenital anomaly characterized by abnormalities in finger and toe development. This suggests that Anodontia might be related to skeletal development rather than dental growth. Therefore, it's unlikely that Anodontia affects the growth of dental-related structures such as maxilla or mandible.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
