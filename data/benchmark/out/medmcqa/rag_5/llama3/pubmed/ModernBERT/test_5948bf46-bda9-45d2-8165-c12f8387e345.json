["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about both ketogenic and glucogenic amino acids. Glucogenic amino acids are those that can be converted into glucose through gluconeogenesis. According to the document [Lactic acidosis induced by excessive ingestion of metformin], metformine inhibits hepatic gluconeogenesis, which suggests that glucogenic amino acids are involved in this process. In contrast, ketogenic amino acids are those that can be converted into ketone bodies, which are an alternative source of energy for the brain. According to the document [Correlation of blood and brain amino acids in hypoglycemic and normoglycemic rats], newborn rats can utilize gluconeogenic amino acids as a source of energy by brain. This suggests that glucogenic amino acids have ketogenic properties. Therefore, we are looking for an amino acid that is both glucogenic and ketogenic.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
