["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Since the question asks which amino acid is quickly converted to tyrosine, I need to look for information about amino acids that are involved in the conversion of phenylalanine to tyrosine. From the provided documents, [Valine is a precursor of propionyl-CoA] suggests that valine is a precursor of propionyl-CoA, which is not directly related to the conversion of phenylalanine to tyrosine. [Determination of C-terminal amino acid content in dog prothrombin] and [Relationship between amino acid production and phosphate-dissolving capacity of bacteria] do not provide information about the conversion of phenylalanine to tyrosine. Therefore, I will focus on [Isotopic effect in enzymatic oxidation of methane], which mentions that methane is converted to CO2 and that deuteromethane (CD4) is a competitive inhibitor of CH4 oxidation. This suggests that there are enzymes involved in the conversion of one amino acid to another, but it does not provide specific information about phenylalanine being converted to tyrosine. However, [Influence of nitrogen components of wine on the growth of lactic acid bacteria] mentions that peptides support the growth of malolactic bacteria, which implies that peptide-bound amino acids can be broken down and utilized by microorganisms. This provides a hint that amino acids may be converted into other forms or compounds. Since phenylalanine is an aromatic amino acid, I will look for information about its conversion to tyrosine. Unfortunately, none of the provided documents directly state which amino acid is quickly converted to tyrosine. However, based on the hints provided by [Influence of nitrogen components of wine on the growth of lactic acid bacteria] and the general knowledge that phenylalanine can be converted to tyrosine through various metabolic pathways, I will make an educated guess.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
