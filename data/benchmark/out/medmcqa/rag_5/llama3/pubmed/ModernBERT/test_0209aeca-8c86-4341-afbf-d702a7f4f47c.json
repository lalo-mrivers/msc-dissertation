["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the teeth least involved in periodontitis. Upon reviewing the provided documents, none of them specifically discuss periodontitis or its relationship to third molars, lips, bacterial mutation rates, pit and fissure sealants, or organic constipation. Therefore, we must rely on general knowledge about periodontitis. Periodontitis is a common condition affecting the gums surrounding teeth.
