["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about replacing amino acids. The provided documents are not directly related to amino acid replacement. However, one document talks about molecular weights of haptens. Haptens are small molecules, often peptides or proteins, that can cause an immune response. They have a limited range of molecular weights, below 400. This information is relevant to the question because it provides context for understanding what happens when amino acids are replaced.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
