["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks for a monomeric intermediate filament. Monomeric means single molecule. Intermediate filaments are protein structures that provide mechanical support to cells. They are classified based on their function and the tissues they are found in. Vimentin, keratin, and desmin are all intermediate filaments. However, tubulin is not an intermediate filament. Tubulin is a part of microtubules, which are another type of cytoskeletal structure.\", \"answer_choice\": D}"]
