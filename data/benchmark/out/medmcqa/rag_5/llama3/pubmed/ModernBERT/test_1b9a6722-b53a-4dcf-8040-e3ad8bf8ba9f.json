["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the measurement of prevalence of pit & fissure caries. The provided documents are related to different topics such as Caffey's disease, dental caries and pregnancy, fluoridation effects on adult dental caries, and carbon-fibre reinforced plates for problem fractures. None of these documents directly address the measurement of prevalence of pit & fissure caries. Therefore, it is likely that the question refers to a widely used index or method in dentistry. A search through the provided documents reveals no mention of Transillumination as a method for measuring caries.

ICDAS is an index used for measuring caries experience, which includes pit and fissure caries.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
