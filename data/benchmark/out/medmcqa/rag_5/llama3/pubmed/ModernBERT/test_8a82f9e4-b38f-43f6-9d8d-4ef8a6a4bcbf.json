["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with fever, jaundice, yellow colored urine with clay colored stools, which are typical symptoms of viral hepatitis. The patient is a known smoker who has developed aversion to cigarette smoking recently, and scleral icterus is present on examination. LFTs show elevated bilirubin levels (total billirubin 18.5, direct billirubin 7.5). To rule out acute viral hepatitis, I would focus on tests that detect specific viral markers for hepatitis A, B, C, D, and E. The patient's age is not a concern as the question does not specify any chronic liver disease. Considering the patient's symptoms and LFTs, the most likely cause of jaundice is acute viral hepatitis.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C: HBsAg, IgM antiHBC,AntiHDV AntiHCV AntiHEV\""]
