["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Since the question is about blood glucose measurement, I should look for documents that mention collecting blood samples for glucose measurement. The relevant document is 'How to collect blood for the measurement of HGH, LH, FSH, cyclic AMP, folic acid, cortisol and testosterone.' This document states that anticoagulant EDTA can be used to measure various constituents including peptide hormones, steroid hormones, folic acid, and cyclic AMP in the same blood sample. As there is no specific mention of glucose measurement, I should look for other documents. In 'Blood transfusion and cross matching', I see no mention of glucose measurement or anticoagulant usage. The other two documents do not seem relevant to this question either.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
