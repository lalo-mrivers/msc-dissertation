["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about a disease caused by Staphylococcus aureus that is not mediated through a toxin. The provided documents suggest that Staphylococcus aureus can cause septicemia (Septicemia caused by DF-2), but this is due to an unidentified gram-negative rod, not directly from the Staphylococcus aureus itself.
