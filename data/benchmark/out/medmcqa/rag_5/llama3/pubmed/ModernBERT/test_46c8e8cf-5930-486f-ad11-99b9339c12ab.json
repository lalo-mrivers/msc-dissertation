["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the presence of reticular fibers of collagen tissues. From the given documents, we can see that reticulum fibres are present in the mammalian retina (document 2). This suggests that reticular fibers are related to connective tissue, specifically collagenous tissue. There is no mention of thymus, spleen, bone marrow or lymph node in relation to reticular fibers. Therefore, we need to look for documents that describe the histology of these tissues. Document 4 describes the histology of intrathoracic rib and mentions investing layers of pleura, which suggests a connective tissue-like structure. This does not suggest the presence of reticular fibers. Similarly, document 1 describes the pigmentation pattern of the human area striata, but does not mention anything about collagenous tissues or reticular fibers. Document 3 describes granular-cell Abrikosov's tumours and mentions polymorphism of cells, which is not relevant to the question. The only remaining option is 'Thymus', as there is no information in the given documents that suggests reticular fibers are present in thymus.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
