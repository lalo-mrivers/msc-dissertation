["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the treatment of a fractured maxillary central incisor pulp that shows no response. There are no signs of periapical lesion or infection. Since there's no indication of infection or pain, we can rule out root canal treatment as an option. The goal is to maintain the integrity of the tooth and prevent further complications. Apexification is often used in immature teeth with incomplete root formation. In this case, since the fracture occurred 10 months ago, it's likely that the root development has been completed, making apexification less suitable. Therefore, we can focus on pulp capping or pulpotomy as viable options.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
