However, none of these documents explicitly mention ceramide or its classification. Therefore, we must rely on our knowledge of biochemistry to answer this question. Ceramides are a type of sphingolipid, which is a class of lipids that contain a long-chain amino alcohol called sphingosine. Based on this information, we can deduce that ceramide is a type of lipid.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"]
