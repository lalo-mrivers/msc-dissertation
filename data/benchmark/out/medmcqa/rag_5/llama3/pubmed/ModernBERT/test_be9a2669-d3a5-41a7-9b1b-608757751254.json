["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the storage temperature of RBCs. Among the provided documents, none of them specifically mention RBCs or their storage temperatures. However, I can look for any mention of temperature ranges that could be relevant to blood storage. In the document 'Availability of cryo-solutions for use in a thermodilution method', there is no direct mention of RBCs but it discusses storing cooled injectate at constant temperature. This suggests that low temperatures are involved, which is consistent with standard practices for storing RBCs. Based on this reasoning, I can eliminate options C and D as they are too high or equal to body temperature.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
