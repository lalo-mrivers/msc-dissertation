["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for a rapid source of energy that resynthesizes ATP for exercising muscles. From the provided documents, we can see that muscle can use ATP exclusively as the direct source of energy for contraction. The muscle ATP stores cannot provide more than 1 or 2 kcal of muscular work. To replenish these ATP stores, three processes are used: breakdown of creatine phosphate, anaerobic glycolysis, and aerobic processes. Among these options, phosphocreatine is a rapid source of energy that resynthesizes ATP.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
