["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks which hormone is/are under inhibitory control of the hypothalamus. The relevant document that discusses the hypothalamus is [Effects of gravitational forces on the nervous system]. This document mentions the adaptation mechanisms and pathological alterations that occur when the human body is submitted to gravitational forces, but it does not specifically discuss hormones. Therefore, we cannot find information about the inhibitory control of hormones by the hypothalamus in this document.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next relevant documents are Airway, breathing, circulation, and disability: what is different about kids? and Norway rat haemoglobin phenotypes: which is the original?. These documents do not provide any information about hormones or their regulation by the hypothalamus.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe last relevant document is Home or hospital?, but this article discusses obstetrics and does not mention hormones or the hypothalamus.\\r\\n\\r\\nGenetic screening for cystic fibrosis also does not provide relevant information.\\r\\n\\r\\nTherefore, we are left with no information that can help us answer this question. However, prolactin is known to be under inhibitory control of the hypothalamus. Growth hormone, on the other hand, is stimulated by the hypothalamus. Therefore, based on this general knowledge, it seems reasonable to choose option D: Both prolactin and growth hormone.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
