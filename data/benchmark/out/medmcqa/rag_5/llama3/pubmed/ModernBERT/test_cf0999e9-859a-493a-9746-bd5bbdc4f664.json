["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the effectiveness of glucagon injection for management of persistent hypoglycemia. The relevant documents mention hyperglycemia and diabetes, but not hypoglycemia. However, we can look at one document that mentions diabetic ketoacidosis, which can cause hypoglycemia. According to this document, a low-dose insulin infusion is used to treat children with diabetic ketoacidosis. Glucagon is not mentioned in this context. We also have documents mentioning oral hypoglycemic agents and continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion for tight blood sugar control. This suggests that glucagon injection may be effective for management of persistent hypoglycemia, except perhaps in cases where there are other underlying conditions or abnormalities that affect its effectiveness.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
