["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Fingerprinting (FINDER) involves recording prints of 8 fingers. Since there are 10 fingers in total (5 on each hand), the remaining two fingers that are excluded from fingerprinting must be the extra pair not included in FINDER's scope. The relevant documents do not provide information about fingerprinting, but we can infer that it includes the thumb and four fingers of one hand, as well as the other four fingers. This leaves the ring finger of both hands as the only two fingers not included in FINDER.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
