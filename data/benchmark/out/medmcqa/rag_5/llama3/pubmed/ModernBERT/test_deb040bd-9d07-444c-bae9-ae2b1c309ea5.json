["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has fatigue, tingling sensation in both hands and legs, fissured red tongue, lesions at angle of mouth, peripheral neuropathy and decreased RBC glutathione reductase activity. This combination suggests a possible mitochondrial disorder due to the presence of ragged-red fibers (indicating mitochondrial dysfunction) and the involvement of multiple systems.
