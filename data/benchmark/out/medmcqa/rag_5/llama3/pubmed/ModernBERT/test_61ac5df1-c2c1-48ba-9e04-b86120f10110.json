["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the given documents, it is evident that radiation affects all three germ layers (ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm) as mentioned in the 'Differentiation of the epiblastic part of chick Hensen's node in coelomic cavity' document. This document explains how the implanted epiblastic part of Hensen's node can differentiate into various tissues including neural, mesodermal, and endodermal ones, which are not essentially different from those derived from a complete node in similar conditions. Since radiation affects all three germ layers, it is likely that it has an impact on the development of all three types of tissue.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
