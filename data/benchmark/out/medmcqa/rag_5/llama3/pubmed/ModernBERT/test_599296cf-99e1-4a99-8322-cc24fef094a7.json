["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is an Rh-negative mother who had indirect Coombs test (ICT) negative. This means she does not have antibodies against the Rh factor. However, she received Anti-D immunoglobulin during pregnancy, which suggests that there was a risk of Rh sensitization or hemolytic disease of the newborn.\n\nGiven this context, we need to consider what would be the ideal approach after delivery. Since the mother had ICT negative, it means her body did not produce antibodies against the Rh factor. Therefore, the risk of hemolytic disease is low.\n\nAccording to the relevant documents, a study on deoxyribonucleic acid fingerprinting mentioned that twins are clearly nonidentical. This implies that even if the baby has an Rh-positive blood group, there would be no risk of hemolytic disease since the mother does not have antibodies against the Rh factor.\n\nIn another document, Sperm microinjection twins: deoxyribonucleic acid fingerprinting mentioned that DNA fingerprints obtained show that they are the children of the putative mother and father. This means that even if there is a risk of hemolytic disease due to the baby's blood group, it would be mitigated by the fact that the mother does not have antibodies against the Rh factor.\n\nConsidering these points, the ideal approach after delivery would be to give another dose of Anti-D 72 hours postpaum depending on the baby blood group (option A). This is because even if the baby has an Rh-positive blood group, there is no risk of hemolytic disease since the mother does not have antibodies against the Rh factor. Therefore, additional doses of Anti-D immunoglobulin are unnecessary.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
