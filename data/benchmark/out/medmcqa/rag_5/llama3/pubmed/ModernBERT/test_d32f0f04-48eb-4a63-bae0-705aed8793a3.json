["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Since the question is about binding of Eukaryotic mRNA to Ribosomes, I will look for relevant information from the provided documents. In 'Cellular site of synthesis of ribosomal proteins in yeast', it mentions that ribosomal proteins are synthesized both on membrane-associated and free polysomes. This suggests that ribosomes can bind to mRNA. Then, I'll look at other documents for any relevant information. In '[Nuclear envelope of frog diplotene oocytes has telomere-binding activity]', there's no direct mention of mRNA binding to ribosomes, but it talks about DNA-protein interaction. Similarly, in '[Cell-free system of protein synthesis from rat's cardiac muscle]', the focus is on a cell-free system of protein synthesis, not directly related to mRNA-ribosome binding. Finally, in 'Identification of Sendai virus mRNA species', cell-free translation identifies the message for polypeptide M and NP, which does not provide any information about mRNA-ribosome binding. After reviewing all documents, I can conclude that binding of Eukaryotic mRNA to Ribosomes is facilitated by...\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
