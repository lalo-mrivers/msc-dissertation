["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents provided are literary works, a case study on plagiarism, research papers, and an article on medical procedures. None of these documents contain information about the use of morphine or its contraindications. Therefore, I will need to rely on general knowledge and external sources to answer this question. Morphine is typically used in the treatment of pain, particularly severe pain such as that associated with cancer, end-stage disease, and post-operative pain. However, it should be avoided in patients with respiratory depression or those who are taking other medications that can exacerbate this condition.\n\nIn considering the options provided, I think option B: Biliary colic is unlikely to be the correct answer because morphine can help alleviate the severe pain associated with biliary colic. Options A and D seem plausible, but there is no strong evidence to support avoiding morphine in ischemic or post-operative pain.\n\nTherefore, I will consider option C: Cancer pain. Morphine is often used to treat cancer-related pain, but it should be avoided if the patient has a history of respiratory depression or other conditions that make them more susceptible to this complication.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
