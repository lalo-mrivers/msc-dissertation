["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks which of the options can change gene expression by methylation and acetylation without affecting the content of the gene. This suggests that we are looking for a mechanism that does not involve changes to the DNA sequence itself, but rather affects how the genes are expressed. The key phrase here is 'by methylation and acetylation'. Methylation is related to epigenetics, as it can affect gene expression without changing the underlying DNA sequence. Acetylation is also an epigenetic modification that can affect gene expression. Therefore, the correct answer must be related to epigenetics.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
