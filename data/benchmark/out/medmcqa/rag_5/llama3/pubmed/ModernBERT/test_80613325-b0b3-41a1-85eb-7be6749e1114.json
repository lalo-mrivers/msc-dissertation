["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the shape of the occlusal surface of the permanent maxillary first molar. There are no documents related to suction techniques or oral mucocutaneous junctions that would provide information about the shape of a tooth. The document 'Surgical anatomy of the ascending ramus of the mandible' does not mention the shape of the occlusal surface of a tooth either. The document 'Surgery of the nasal tip' is also irrelevant to this question. Therefore, we should focus on the remaining documents: '[Special aspects of the suction technic]' and '[About the face value of the cleft of the articulus mandibulae (author's transl)]'. These documents describe different topics and do not provide information about tooth shapes either.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
