["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about determining the tetanizing frequency for a muscle. We know that the latent period of the twitch is 10 ms, contraction time is 40 ms, and relaxation time is 50 ms. Tetanus frequency can be calculated by dividing the total duration of one twitch cycle (latent period + contraction time + relaxation time) into the desired time interval. In this case, the total duration of a twitch cycle is 100 ms (10 ms + 40 ms + 50 ms). To find the tetanizing frequency, we need to divide 1000 ms (1 second) by the total duration of one twitch cycle, which is 100 ms.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"]
