["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for a triad of seizure, mental retardation, and sebaceous adenoma. We have to look for documents that describe such a combination. Ring-20 chromosome syndrome does not mention sebaceous adenoma. Drash syndrome is about Wilms' tumor, nephropathy, and genital abnormalities, which do not match the given symptoms. Cogan's syndrome is about interstitial keratitis and vestibuloauditory symptoms, also not matching the question. Miller-Fisher syndrome has ophtalmoplegia, ataxia, and areflexia, not including mental retardation or sebaceous adenoma. The only document left to consider is Fabry's disease, but it does not mention seizure, mental retardation, or sebaceous adenoma either. This leaves us with the possibility that this triad may be a rare condition or not described in these documents. Therefore, we have to look for another source of information. Unfortunately, none of the provided options match this triad.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
