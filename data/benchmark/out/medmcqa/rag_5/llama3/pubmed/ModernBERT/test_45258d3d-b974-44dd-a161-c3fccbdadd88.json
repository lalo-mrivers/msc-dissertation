["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Myelinated nerve fibers are characterized by having a myelin sheath that allows for saltatory conduction of impulses. This means that the action potential jumps from node to node, rather than traveling along the entire length of the axon like in non-myelinated fibers. Membrane currents are generated at nodes of Ranvier, which are gaps in the myelin sheath where the impulse can jump from one node to another. Local anesthesia is effective regardless of whether the nerve is covered by a myelin sheath or not.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
