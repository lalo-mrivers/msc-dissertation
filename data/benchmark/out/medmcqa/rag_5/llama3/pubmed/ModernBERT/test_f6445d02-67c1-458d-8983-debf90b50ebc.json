["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"No relevant information about the nucleus with cardio inhibitory function is provided in the given documents. A thorough search did not reveal any mention of the nucleus or its function. However, a search for cardio-inhibitory nuclei revealed that Nucleus Ambiguus and Nucleus Tractus Solitarius have cardio-inhibitory functions. Rostral Ventrolateral Medulla and Dorsal motor nucleus of vagus are also involved in cardiovascular control but not specifically as cardio-inhibitory nuclei. Therefore, the relevant information can be found outside these documents.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
