["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"None of the provided documents discuss cardiac output during pregnancy. The first document studies blood coagulation in experimental diabetes and does not mention pregnancy at all. The second document investigates the effect of assisted ventilation on arterial carbon dioxide tension, but it also does not relate to pregnancy. The third document describes CPAP-breathing therapy for newborns, which is not relevant to cardiac output during pregnancy. The fourth document examines fetal growth after premature rupture of membranes and does not discuss cardiac output at all. Therefore, the answer must be based on external knowledge or research. After reviewing the available information, it appears that cardiac output increases 30-40% during the third trimester of pregnancy.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
