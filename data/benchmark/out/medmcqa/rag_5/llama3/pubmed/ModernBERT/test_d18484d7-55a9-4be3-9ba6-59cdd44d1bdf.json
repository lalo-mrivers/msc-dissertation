["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"This question combines two different theories: psychoanalytic theory by Freud and cognitive development theory by Piaget. The phallic stage of Freud refers to a specific stage in child development where the child develops an awareness of their own genitalia and begins to experience desires and impulses related to sex. We need to find which stage of Piaget's cognitive development theory corresponds to this stage.\\r\\n\\r\\nLooking at Piaget's stages, we can see that Sensorimotor stage is the first stage of cognitive development where infants and young children learn through sensory experiences and motor activities. This stage roughly corresponds to birth to 2 years old.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Pre-operational stage is the second stage where children use symbols and language but still lack logical thinking skills, around 2-7 years old.\\r\\n\\r\\nConcrete operational stage is the third stage where children develop logical thinking skills but are limited to concrete objects and events, around 7-12 years old.\\r\\n\\r\\nFormal operational stage is the last stage where individuals develop abstract thinking skills and can reason abstractly, typically during adolescence and early adulthood.\\r\\n\\r\\nBased on this information, we can conclude that the phallic stage of Freud corresponds to the Sensorimotor stage of Piaget.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
