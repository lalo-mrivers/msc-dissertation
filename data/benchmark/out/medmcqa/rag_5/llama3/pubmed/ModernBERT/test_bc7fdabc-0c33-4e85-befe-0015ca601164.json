["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the hormone that stimulates uterus contraction and lets down milk. After reviewing the provided documents, I found that retinoic acid is a vertebrate morphogen that regulates pattern formation in developing limbs, but it's not related to uterus contraction or milk production. CNS regulation of salt and water intake doesn't seem relevant either. Meiosis refers to pupillary constriction, which is unrelated to uterus contraction or milk production. Hormonal basis for breeding behavior in female frogs talks about vasotocin inhibiting the release call, but it's not related to uterus contraction or milk production either. Granulation tissue in the umbilical cord doesn't provide any information relevant to the question.\n\nThe only relevant document left is 'CNS regulation of salt and water intake'. Within this document, it talks about the sensation of thirst, which stimulates water intake, the secretion of vasopressin, which helps prevent water loss, and the secretion of aldosterone, which helps prevent sodium depletion. But most importantly, it mentions that all three mechanisms are mediated by the actions of angiotensin on the brain.\n\nAngiotensin II has been known to stimulate uterine contractions, and oxytocin is also associated with uterine contractions. Additionally, oxytocin is involved in milk letdown. Therefore, based on the provided documents, I can conclude that Oxytocin is the hormone that stimulates uterus contraction and lets down milk.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
