["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the role of Golgi tendon organ during voluntary movements. The relevant documents provide information on reflex mechanisms and sensory receptors. Based on the document 'An investigation of the servobehavior of the stretch reflex', it can be inferred that the stretch reflex is not significantly involved in the regulation of muscle length or joint angle during voluntary movements, as observed responses to experimental interruption of voluntary movements did not demonstrate a significant role for spinal reflexes. This implies that other mechanisms may be more important in controlling muscle movement. The document 'Exteroceptive vibration-induced finger flexion reflex in man' suggests that sensory receptors with fast conducting nerve fibers can influence motor performance through a feedback mechanism.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
