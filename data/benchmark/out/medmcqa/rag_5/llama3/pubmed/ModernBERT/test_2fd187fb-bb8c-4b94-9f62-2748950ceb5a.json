["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Thiopental is a highly lipophilic molecule, which means it has high lipid solubility. This property allows it to quickly pass through the blood-brain barrier and interact with its molecular targets in the brain, resulting in rapid onset of anesthesia. However, this same property also leads to rapid redistribution from the brain to other tissues such as fat, muscle, and organs, which is the main mechanism contributing to the short duration of anesthetic action.\", \"answer_choice\": C}"]
