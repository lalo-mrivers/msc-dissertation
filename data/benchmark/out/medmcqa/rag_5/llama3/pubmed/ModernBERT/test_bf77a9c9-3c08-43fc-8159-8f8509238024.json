["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about genomic imprinting. Genomic imprinting refers to the phenomenon where certain genes are expressed depending on their parental origin. The documents provided don't specifically mention genomic imprinting, but one of them mentions DNA modification, which is relevant to this topic. The document that stands out is '[CNA-synthesis in gamma-platlets of wheat (author's transl)]' as it discusses the incorporation of [3H]thymidine into the DNA. This suggests a connection to DNA modification. However, there are no specific details about genomic imprinting in this document. The other documents don't provide relevant information. Therefore, we must look for answers that match our understanding of genomic imprinting and DNA modification. Upon reviewing the answer choices, 'B: Methylation' stands out as it is a well-known process related to DNA modification.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
