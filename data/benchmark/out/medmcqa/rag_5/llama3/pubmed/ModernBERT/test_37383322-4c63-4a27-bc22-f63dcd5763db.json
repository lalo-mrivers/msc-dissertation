["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks to arrange the layers of epidermis from surface to deep layer. Corneocytes are the outermost layer, followed by Merkel cells which are sensory receptor cells. Melanocytes produce melanin and are deeper than the sensory receptors. Langerhans cells are immune cells that present antigens to T-cells and are even deeper than the melanocytes. Therefore, the correct order is from surface to deep: Corneocytes > Merkel cells > Melanocytes > Langerhans cells.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
