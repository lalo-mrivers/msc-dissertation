["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To calculate the sensitivity and specificity of the latex agglutination test for detection of meningitis, I will follow the formula for true positives (TP), false positives (FP), true negatives (TN) and false negatives (FN). TP = number of diseased individuals with positive test results = 273. FP = number of non-diseased individuals with positive test results = ? TN = number of non-diseased individuals with negative test results = ? FN = number of diseased individuals with negative test results = ?. From the given data, I can calculate TP and FN: TP = 273, FN = 595 - 273 = 322. Since the test is approved, it must have no false positives (FP = 0). Therefore, TN = 595 - 273 = 322. Using these values, I can calculate sensitivity and specificity.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
