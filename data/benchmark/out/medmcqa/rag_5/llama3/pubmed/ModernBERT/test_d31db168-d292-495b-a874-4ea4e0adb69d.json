["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"After reviewing the provided documents, I did not find any information related to dental anatomy or morphology. Therefore, I will focus on the titles of the articles to make an educated guess about the question. The title '[Permanence of the endemy of human anthrax in Lower Casamance (author's transl)].
