["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the primary factors influencing fracture of gold restoration. Based on the provided documents, there is no specific information related to fracture of gold restoration. However, we can analyze the documents and identify relevant points that might be helpful in answering this question.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom the [Modified hygroscopic gold casting technique] document, we learn about a modified technique for gold casting, but it doesn't directly address the issue of fracture.\\r\\n\\r\\nConsidering the other documents, such as [Dental survey of 620 Soviet immigrants], [Permanence of the endemy of human anthrax in Lower Casamance (author's transl)], and [Luxatio pedis subtalo], we find no direct correlation with the topic of gold restoration fracture.\\r\\n\\r\\nGiven that there is no explicit information, we need to rely on general principles or related knowledge. Fracture in restorations can be influenced by various factors, including design, alloy type, and the ratio of noble metal to base metal.\\r\\n\\r\\nTherefore, it's reasonable to conclude that fracture of gold restoration primarily depends on...\\\",\\ \"answer_choice\": D}"]
