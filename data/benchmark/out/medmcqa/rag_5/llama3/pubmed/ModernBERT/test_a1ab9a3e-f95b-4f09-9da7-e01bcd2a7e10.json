["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"After reviewing the provided documents, none of the mentioned conditions (hyperthelia, anti-Gy-a, Van Buchem's disease, go-kart injuries, or trapshooter's stigma) relate to joint types. Therefore, I will focus on my general knowledge of anatomy and physiology to answer this question. A diarthrosis is a type of joint that is characterized by the presence of a synovial cavity and is freely movable. Plane, Symphyses, Condyloid, and Saddle are all types of joints, but only one option does not fit the definition of a diarthrosis.\n\nFrom my knowledge, Saddle joints are actually amphiarthroses (joints with some degree of limited mobility), not diarthroses. Therefore, the correct answer is B: Symphyses.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
