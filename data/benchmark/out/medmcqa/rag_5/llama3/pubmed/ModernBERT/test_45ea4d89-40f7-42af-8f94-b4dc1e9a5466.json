["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about assessing the efficacy of a newly developed drug compared to placebo. Confidence intervals are used to make inferences about population parameters based on sample data. Since we're checking for the efficacy of the drug, we need to consider whether the true effect of the drug is above or below zero (no effect). A 95% confidence interval allows us to determine whether the estimated effect is statistically significant and therefore clinically meaningful. If the upper bound of the interval exceeds a certain threshold, it suggests that the drug has a positive effect.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
