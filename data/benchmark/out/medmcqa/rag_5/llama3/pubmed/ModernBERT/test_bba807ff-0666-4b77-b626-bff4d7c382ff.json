["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the type of strain that develops when force is applied perpendicular to a surface. In the provided documents, there are mentions of anelastic effects, stress distributions, and mechanical impedance, but none of these directly relate to the application of force perpendicular to a surface. However, we can look at the document titled 'Cement line motion in bone.' It discusses the deformation of compact bovine bone under torsional load, which implies that the force is being applied perpendicularly. According to this document, the displacement occurs at the cement lines and is responsible for part or all of the long-term deformation. This suggests that the type of strain developed is anelastic, which is a form of shear strain.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"]
