["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the innervation of stretch fibers in striated muscle. After reviewing the relevant documents, I found that the document [Muscle relaxation and muscle spindle adaptation] talks about muscle spindles and their adaptation to changes in muscle length. This suggests that the stretch fibers are likely associated with the sensory function of these spindles. The document also mentions three functionally different groups of muscle spindles, which further supports this conclusion.\", \"answer_choice\": D}"]
