["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about GPCR (G protein-coupled receptor) that does not act through opening of potassium channels. The provided documents do not directly mention the specific receptors and their mechanisms. However, we can look for information on the types of GPCRs and their actions. For instance, Muscarinic M2 receptor and Serotonin 5 HT1 receptor are both GPCRs that do not necessarily open potassium channels.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe other options, Dopamine D2 receptor and Angiotensin 1 receptor, may also be involved in the opening of potassium channels.\\r\\n\\r\\nBased on this information, we can conclude that Muscarinic M2 receptor and Serotonin 5 HT1 receptor are the most likely candidates for GPCRs that do not act through opening of potassium channels.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A/C\"}"]
