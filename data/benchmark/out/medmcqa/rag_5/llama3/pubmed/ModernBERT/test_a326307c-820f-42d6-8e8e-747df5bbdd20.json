["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"None of the provided documents relate to expansion screws or their expansions. The first document discusses plasma viscosity, the second talks about biological aging, the third describes a curved ruler for measuring along the surface of the globe, the fourth presents a growth equation, and the fifth explains how to speed up computation of spherical harmonics. Therefore, we cannot draw any conclusions from these documents that would allow us to determine the expansion caused by an expansion screw.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
