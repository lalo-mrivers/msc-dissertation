["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the radiopacity that frequently obliterate the root apices of maxillary molars. I will analyze each option, considering if there is any information related to maxillary molars or sinuses in the provided documents. Option A, Maxillary sinus, seems relevant as one of the documents talks about the mandibular joints and their relation to the squamal discoidal and mandibular faces. However, this document does not mention anything specific about radiopacity or root apices. Options B and C do not seem related to maxillary molars or sinuses.
