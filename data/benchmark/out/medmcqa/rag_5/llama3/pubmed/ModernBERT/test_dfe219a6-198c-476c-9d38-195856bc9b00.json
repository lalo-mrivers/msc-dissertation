["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking to classify a traumatized tooth that is non-vital with or without crown fracture. After reviewing the provided documents, I found no information related to dental injuries or classifications of such. However, one document describes an abscessed tooth causing massive facial infection.

Within this system, non-vital teeth with crown fracture would fall under Class-V\", \"answer_choice\": C}"]
