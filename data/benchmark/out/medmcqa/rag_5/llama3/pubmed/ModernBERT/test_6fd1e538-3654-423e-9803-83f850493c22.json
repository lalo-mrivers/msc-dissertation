["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The cell membrane is freely permeable to ions X, Y, and Z. At resting membrane potential, the equilibrium potentials of X and Y are -30mV and -40mV respectively. This suggests that X and Y are positively charged ions, likely K+. The presence of these two ions contributes to the resting membrane potential. If a drug is infused that can block the permeability of Z, it will reduce the movement of Z ions across the cell membrane. Since the resting membrane potential is not influenced by Z, its blockade would not significantly affect the resting membrane potential.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
