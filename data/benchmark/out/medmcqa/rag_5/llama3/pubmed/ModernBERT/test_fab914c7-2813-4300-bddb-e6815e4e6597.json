["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about a highly vascular tumor of the brain and spinal cord in adults. From the provided documents, I can rule out options A (metastasis) and B (pilocytic astrocytoma), as these are not typically described as highly vascular tumors. Option D (cavernous malformation) is also unlikely to be the correct answer, as it is a type of vascular malformation rather than a tumor. Therefore, I am left with option C, hemangioblastoma.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
