["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about a patient with recurrent missed abortions at 14-16 weeks. The current pregnancy has also ended in a missed abortion at 12 weeks. There are several possible causes of recurrent miscarriages, including antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). APS can be caused by lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin antibody, or anti-beta2 glycoprotein I antibody. The patient's history and the current pregnancy suggest that she may have APS. Therefore, testing for lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin antibody, and anti-beta2 glycoprotein I antibody would be warranted to rule out APS as a cause of her recurrent miscarriages.\n\nViral infections such as syphilis can also cause missed abortions, so testing the husband and wife for VDRL is also appropriate. The fetal karyotype test is not directly related to the patient's condition, but it may be relevant if the patient has had previous miscarriages with abnormal fetuses.\n\nTherefore, the only option that is not warranted is D: Fetal karyotype.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
