One document mentions prenatal diagnosis of chromosome abnormalities and defines a group of prospective parents who are at risk of producing offspring with disability due to chromosomal abnormalities. This suggests that some chromosomal abnormalities can be detected early on. Another document discusses ultrasound screening for congenital hip dislocation, but this is not relevant to the 1st trimester.
