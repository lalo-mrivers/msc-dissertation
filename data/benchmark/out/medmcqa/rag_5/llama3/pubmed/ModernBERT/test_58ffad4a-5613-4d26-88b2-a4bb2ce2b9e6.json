["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking which drug can be stopped abruptly without any withdrawal symptoms. The provided documents do not directly mention the specified drugs (Escitalopram, Fluoxetine, Fluvoxamine, Seraline) and their potential for abrupt discontinuation. However, we can look at the information about psychotropic medications and detoxification from methadone maintenance to find an answer.\\r\\nThe text on psychotropic medications does not provide any specific information on withdrawal symptoms or the ability of these drugs to be stopped abruptly without symptoms.\\r\\nOn the other hand, the document on Detoxification from methadone maintenance discusses successful withdrawal from methadone maintenance. Methadone is known for its severe withdrawal symptoms when discontinued abruptly.\\r\\nConsidering that none of the specified drugs are mentioned in the provided documents, we can assume that they might not have been studied for abrupt discontinuation.
