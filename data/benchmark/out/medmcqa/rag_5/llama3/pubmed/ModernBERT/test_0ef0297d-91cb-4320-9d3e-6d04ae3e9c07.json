["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about what is not required for protein synthesis of eukaryotes. The provided documents mention cell-free systems of protein synthesis from rat heart muscle, but they don't specifically discuss the requirements for protein synthesis in eukaryotes. However, we can analyze the given options to find the one that is not directly related to protein synthesis. RNA polymerase is involved in transcription, not translation or protein synthesis. Ribosomes are mentioned in the context of protein synthesis, and Peptidyl transferase is an essential component of ribosomes. Amino acyl tRNA synthetase is responsible for charging tRNAs with amino acids, which is a crucial step in protein synthesis.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
