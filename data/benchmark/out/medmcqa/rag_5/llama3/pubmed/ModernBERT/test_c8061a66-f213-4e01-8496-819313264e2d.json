["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the possible result of excessive monomer incorporation into an acrylic resin mixture. There are no relevant documents provided that specifically discuss this topic. However, it's essential to analyze the given texts for potential connections or analogies. The only mention of a polymer is in the text about polycarboxylate cement, which bonds with gold, but this doesn't provide any information about acrylic resins or monomers. Therefore, we must rely on general knowledge about polymers and their properties to answer this question.\n\nThe most plausible result of excessive monomer incorporation into an acrylic resin mixture is the possibility of an increased polymer chain length, leading to a material with different mechanical properties. This could potentially result in 'Excessive shrinkage' as the newly formed polymer chains contract during curing. However, without direct information about this specific topic, our answer will be based on general knowledge and not directly supported by the provided texts.\n\nWith these considerations in mind, we can now choose an answer from the available options.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
