["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents discuss thromboprophylaxis using heparin. In [Anticoagulant-induced prophylaxis of thrombosis (author's transl)], it is mentioned that the dosage should be calculated on the basis of body weight, and control measurements can diminish side effects. This suggests a systemic administration route. In [Prevention of venous thrombosis in surgery], low-molecular weight heparins are discussed as being effective for preventing postoperative thromboembolism, with no specific route mentioned. In [Prophylaxis of thromboembolism using low dosage heparin (author's transl)], the efficacy and regulation of low-dosage-Heparin are surveyed, without mentioning a specific route. Finally, in the Transarterial electrocoagulation therapy section, there is no mention of thromboprophylaxis or heparin administration. Based on this information, the most likely route of administration for postoperative thromboprophylaxis by low molecular weight heparin is subcutaneous.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
