["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the relationship between the primary target and the secondary target. From the provided documents, it seems that we are looking at a protein-protein interaction scenario. In 'Modulation of C3b hemolytic activity by a plasma protein distinct from C3b inactivator', we see that there's a protein that binds to cell-bound C3b, inhibiting its function. This suggests that the secondary target (the protein) has a specific structure or site that allows it to bind with the primary target (C3b). The other documents don't seem to be directly related to this question, so we'll focus on this one.\", \n\"answer_choice\": C"]
