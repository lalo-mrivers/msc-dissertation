["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, we are looking for syndromes associated with uniparental disomy. Prader-Willi syndrome is a classic example of a syndrome caused by uniparental disomy (UPD), specifically paternal UPD. Russell-Silver syndrome and Angelman syndrome can also be caused by UPD.

Therefore, we can conclude that Bloom syndrome is the only option that is NOT associated with uniparental disomy.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"]
