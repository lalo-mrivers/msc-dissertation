["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about postductal coarctation of the aorta, which means that there's an obstruction after the ductus arteriosus. In this case, blood flow to the lower limbs needs to be maintained through collateral arteries. Since the ductus arteriosus is blocked, blood flow from the ascending aorta to the descending aorta is restricted. The key is to find out which arteries are responsible for maintaining blood flow to the lower limbs in this scenario.\n\nPostductal coarctation of the aorta is typically associated with collaterals developing between the systemic and pulmonary circulations. This means that there's a connection between the aorta and the pulmonary arteries, allowing blood to bypass the obstruction and reach the lower limbs.\n\nThe relevant collateral arteries are the intercostal arteries and the costocervical trunk. These arteries connect the descending aorta to the pulmonary arteries, thereby maintaining blood flow to the lower limbs.\n\nNone of the other options (A-D) seem to fit the clinical scenario described in postductal coarctation of the aorta.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
