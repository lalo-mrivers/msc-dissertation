["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The parent who is homozygous for an autosomal recessive gene is already expressing the recessive phenotype. This means they have two copies of the recessive allele (homozygous). The other parent, being heterozygous, has one copy of the recessive allele and one copy of the normal allele. Since this is an autosomal recessive trait, both parents must contribute their recessive allele for a child to be affected. As the first parent already has two copies of the recessive allele, they can only pass on the recessive allele. The second parent, being heterozygous, can either pass on the recessive allele or the normal allele. Since they are only passing on one copy of their genes, the likelihood of them passing on both recessive alleles to a child is low.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
