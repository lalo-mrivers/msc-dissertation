["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about space maintainers for a 7-year-old patient with teeth numbers 74 and 85 indicated for extraction. Since the Furness-Moore Code is used for dental findings, it doesn't provide information on space maintainers. The documents mention various topics like Bryant's traction, chamber-angle photos, immediate diagnosis, and displacement fractures of the collum in the growth period, but none of these relate to the extraction of teeth numbers 74 and 85 or the use of a specific space maintainer.\n\nIt is important to consider what space maintainers are used for. Space maintainers are used to keep the space where the extracted tooth was open, preventing other teeth from drifting into that space and maintaining the natural alignment of the remaining teeth.\n\nBased on this information, one can conclude that the most appropriate space maintainer would be a lingual arch space maintainer because it is designed to maintain the space between two adjacent teeth. Therefore, it would be suitable for this 7-year-old patient who needs a space maintainer for teeth numbers 74 and 85.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
