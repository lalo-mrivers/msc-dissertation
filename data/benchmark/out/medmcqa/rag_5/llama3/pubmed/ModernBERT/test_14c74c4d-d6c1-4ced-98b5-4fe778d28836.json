From the given documents, we can see that one of them talks about the effects of ammonia on small laboratory animals (rats) under various environmental conditions. This suggests that ammonia is a substance with a high concentration in the air that can cause stress on thermoregulation. In urea cycle disorders, ammonia is also an important factor to be controlled. The documents don't directly mention drugs used for this purpose, but they do provide information about albumin recovery processes and thermodilution techniques. However, one of the papers talks about pesticides concentration calculations which might not seem related at first. However, a quick glance at the document's title suggests it could be relevant as pesticides are also substances that can cause stress on animals.
