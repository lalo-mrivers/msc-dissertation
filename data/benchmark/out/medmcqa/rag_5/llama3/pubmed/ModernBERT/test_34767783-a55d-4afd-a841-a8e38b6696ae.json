["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the greatest movement seen in a type of joint. The provided documents are articles on various medical topics, including eye surgery and canine tooth injuries. None of these articles discuss joints or movement. Therefore, it's unlikely that the answer can be found directly from these documents.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo approach this question, I'll consider general knowledge about joints in anatomy. There are three main types of joints: cartilaginous (synarthroses), fibrous (amphiarthroses), and synovial (diarthroses). Synovial joints allow for the greatest movement.\\r\\n\\r\\nBased on this information, I'm confident that the correct answer is B: Diarthroses.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
