["{\n  \"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the 'muscles of mastication' group. I can refer to the relevant documents for information on the muscles involved in mastication (chewing). The document on covering defects after exstirpation of tumours in the ear region does not provide any information on the muscles involved in mastication. The document on talipes equinovarus also does not provide relevant information. The document on go-kart injuries is unrelated to the question. The document on acromesomelic dwarfism describes physical features and does not mention the muscles of mastication. The document on the constricted (cup and lop) ear provides information on ear deformities, but this is also unrelated to the question. Therefore, I will rely solely on my prior knowledge of anatomy and physiology. The muscles involved in mastication are typically considered to be the masseter, temporalis, medial pterygoid, lateral pterygoid, and anterior digastric. Among these, buccinator is not a muscle of mastication.\",\n  \"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
