["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"No relevant information about mandibular premolars or multiple canals is found in the provided documents. Therefore, I will focus on general knowledge of root canal systems. According to 'Anatomy of root canals.

Mandibular premolars are a type of tooth, and as such, they would likely follow similar patterns found in other teeth. Given this information, it is reasonable to assume that multiple canals in mandibular premolars could occur.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"]
