["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Prions are infectious particles that cannot be inactivated by heat or chemicals. They are known for their unique characteristic of causing neurodegenerative diseases such as Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease and Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE). Since there is no relevant information about prions in the provided documents, I will focus on the characteristics of prions mentioned in medical literature. According to that, prions are not readily inactivated by autoclave at 121oC, they do not evoke strong immunogenic reactions, and they have long incubation periods. Therefore, I can conclude that prions do not contain DNA/RNA.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
