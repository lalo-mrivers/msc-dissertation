["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about a normal heart sound during pregnancy. After reviewing the provided documents, I did not find any information specifically mentioning pregnancy or cardiovascular sounds. However, one of the articles mentions 'S2' which refers to the second heart sound. Upon further review of the relevant documents, there are some hints that might be helpful in answering this question. The article on dizziness does not mention anything related to heart sounds. The Panisset-Pop syndrome is about fundus photography and has no connection to heart sounds either. The swallowing assessment article is unrelated to cardiovascular sounds as well. Finally, the article about galvanism is also irrelevant to the present question.\n\nNow that we have reviewed all the articles, let's look for any clues or hints. In the article on dizziness, it mentions 'S2' which could be a heart sound. After re-reading the text, I noticed that it talks about an 'organic or functional' case of chronic, uncompensated asymmetrical vestibular function presenting with seemingly bizarre symptoms. Although this does not directly relate to pregnancy or cardiovascular sounds, it does mention 'S2'.\n\nNow let's review our options again: A: Fixed splitting of S2, B: S3, C: S4, D: Pericardial knock.\n\nBased on the information provided in the articles and the hints found, I think that option A: Fixed splitting of S2 might be a normal finding during pregnancy. However, please note that this is not explicitly mentioned in any of the articles.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
