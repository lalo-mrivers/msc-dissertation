["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking which hormone increases the sensitivity of heart to epinephrine. None of the hormones listed (Parathyroid, Insulin, Thyroid, Glucagon) are mentioned as affecting the sensitivity of the myocardium in the provided documents. However, one document does mention an increase in sensitivity of the myocardium to acetylcholine and a decrease in its sensitivity to noradrenaline during training bradycardia.

One document also mentions the effect of serotonin on strips of calf hepatic arteries, which does not seem relevant to this question.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"None of the above\"\n}"]
