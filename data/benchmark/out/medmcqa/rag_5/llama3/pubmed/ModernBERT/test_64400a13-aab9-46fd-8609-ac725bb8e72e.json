["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about what reduces GFR (Glomerular Filtration Rate). Increased renal blood flow increases GFR. Efferent aeriole constriction also increases GFR as it allows more blood to reach the glomerulus. Renal stone in ureter would not directly affect GFR, but could potentially cause hydronephrosis and decreased GFR if left untreated. Decreased oncotic pressure is a known factor that can decrease GFR. Therefore, the answer is one of the choices.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
