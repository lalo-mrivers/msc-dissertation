["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about N. gonorrhoea, which is a bacterial pathogen. The first thing to do is to identify the characteristics of N. gonorrhoea and then compare them with the options provided.\n\nFrom my knowledge, N. gonorrhoea is a common cause of urethritis in males, so option A is likely true.\n\nNext, I need to check if all stains are highly susceptible to penicillin. According to my knowledge, penicillin-based antibiotics are effective against N. gonorrhoeeae. Therefore, option B is also likely true.\n\nThe third option C mentions axoregnic strains causing disseminated gonococcal infection. Axoregnic means related to the heart or blood vessels. After reviewing relevant documents, I found that N. gonorrhoea can cause disseminated gonococcal infection, especially with certain strains. Therefore, option C is also true.\n\nFinally, I checked if N. gonorrhoea is found exclusively in human beings. My knowledge indicates that N. gonorrhoea is a zoonotic pathogen, meaning it can be found in primates and other animals as well. Therefore, option D is false.\n\nAfter analyzing the options based on my knowledge, I deduced that the correct answer would be option D.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
