["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for G2 phase blockers, which means we need to identify the compounds that are NOT G2 phase blockers. The given options are Etoposide, Topotecan, Paclitaxel, and Daunorubicin. We can start by reviewing each option's mechanism of action:\n\n* Etoposide: It intercalates into DNA strands and inhibits topoisomerase II activity.\n* Topotecan: It binds to the minor groove of DNA and stabilizes the topoisomerase I-DNA complex, leading to the inhibition of topoisomerase I.\n* Paclitaxel: It stabilizes microtubules by binding to Î²-tubulin, which prevents the separation of sister chromatids during mitosis (G2 phase).\n* Daunorubicin: It intercalates into DNA strands and inhibits topoisomerase II activity.\n\nBased on their mechanisms of action, Paclitaxel is the only one that is a G2 phase blocker. Therefore, all the other options are G2 phase blockers except:\n\n\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
