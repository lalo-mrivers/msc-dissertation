["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking how patient radiation can be decreased in intraoral radiographs. The relevant document that comes to mind is [Kelman phaco-emulsification. Results and complications.] which talks about radiation exposure. However, it does not seem directly related to the topic. Another document that seems more relevant is [New angiographic knowledge regarding the female breast (author's transl)]. This article discusses abnormal mammograms and breast angiography, but it also mentions vascular findings within and outside tumors, which does not seem relevant to patient radiation in intraoral radiographs. The other documents ([Posttraumatic alterations demonstrated by isotope cisternography (author's transl)] and [Some details concerning hospitalism (author's transl)]) do not seem directly related to the topic either. Therefore, it seems that the answer lies within [CT-tomometrie. Part 2: Diagnostic--contrast media of iodine (author's transl)]. This article discusses the relation between delta-Nr. and concentration of iodine in tissue, which seems somewhat relevant to radiation exposure. However, upon closer examination, there does not seem to be any direct connection between these two topics. The other option that is left is B: Intensifying screens, which could potentially decrease patient radiation in intraoral radiographs by using a lower intensity or a different type of screen.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
