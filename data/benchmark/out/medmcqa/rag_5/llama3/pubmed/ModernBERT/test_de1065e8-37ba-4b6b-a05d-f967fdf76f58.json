["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about MHC Class II proteins. The provided documents are related to transcription, DNA sequences, plasmid-coded proteins, mRNA species, and splicing factors. None of these documents explicitly mention MHC Class II proteins or the cells that express them. Therefore, we need to rely on general knowledge about MHC Class II proteins. MHC Class II proteins are presented by antigen-presenting cells (APCs) such as dendritic cells, macrophages, and B-cells. This information is not provided in the given documents, but it is a well-established fact in immunology.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
