["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about Streptococcus mutans being a principal etiologic agent of caries. The key aspect mentioned is that it produces organic acids and also has the specified additional characteristic. Based on the provided documents, we can see that Streptococcus mutans is strongly implicated in the aetiology of human dental caries (Evidence for the transmissibility of human dental caries). Since it's a well-known fact about S. mutans being involved in dental caries, we can focus on the second aspect. The documents don't mention anything about forming a gelatinous matrix, metabolizing substrate from saliva, deriving energy from enamel constituents, or living symbiotically with lactobacillus. However, they do emphasize that Streptococcus mutans produces organic acids which are associated with dental caries.\", \"answer_choice\": B}"]
