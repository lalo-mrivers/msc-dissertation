["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Antigen-presenting cells are a type of immune cell that play a crucial role in the adaptive immune response. They process and present antigens to T-cells, which then recognize and respond to these antigens. The question asks about the types of antigen-presenting cells, so I will examine the provided documents for any relevant information. After reviewing the documents, I found that M-cells, macrophages, and Langerhans cells are all mentioned as different types of immune cells. However, thymocytes are not mentioned in relation to antigen presentation or the adaptive immune response. Therefore, I conclude that Thymocytes is the correct answer.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
