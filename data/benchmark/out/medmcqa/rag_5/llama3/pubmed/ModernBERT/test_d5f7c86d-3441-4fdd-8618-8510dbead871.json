["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the mammalian genome, and it's asking about the maximum number of genes that code for receptors. The documents provided are mostly about bacterial mutation rates, gene evolution, chromosomal translocation, RNA localization, and RNA editing in trypanosomes. None of these seem directly related to the mammalian genome or receptor coding genes. However, there is one document that mentions the 3' untranslated region of mRNA, which could be relevant. It's possible that the answer lies in this context.\", \"answer_choice\": C}"]
