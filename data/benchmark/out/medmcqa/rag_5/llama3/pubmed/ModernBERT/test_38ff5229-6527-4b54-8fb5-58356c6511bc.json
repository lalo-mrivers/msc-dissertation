["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Since we are talking about adrenocorticosteroids, let's look at the relevant documents. One document mentions that noradrenaline causes a significant release of TSH while adrenaline and dopamine do not. This suggests that there may be some relationship between the adrenal glands and hormones like cortisol. Another document talks about the inhibition of platelet aggregation by beta-sitosterol and eupatilin, which are both found in Artemisia argyi. However, this doesn't seem directly related to adrenocorticosteroids. The other documents discuss different topics such as thyroid function, testosterone metabolism, and exercise-induced hyperventilation. Given that these documents don't provide direct information on the effects of adrenocorticosteroids, we should focus on general knowledge or established facts about corticosteroid excess. Adrenal cortex hormone excess is known to cause osteoporosis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
