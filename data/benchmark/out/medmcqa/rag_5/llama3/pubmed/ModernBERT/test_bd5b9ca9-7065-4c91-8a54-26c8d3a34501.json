["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about a young man on high protein diet and raw eggs who developed weakness after 3 days. The blood investigation revealed hypoglycemia. Thiamin deficiency can cause hypoglycemia, as seen in the case of thiamin deficiency in cats (Thiamin deficiency in a colony of cats). Thiamin is necessary for glucose metabolism. Therefore, it is likely that the young man's hypoglycemia was due to inhibition of an enzyme involved in glucose metabolism. The relevant documents suggest that thiamin is necessary for pyruvate dehydrogenase activity (Feeding-induced hypocalcaemia). Pyruvate dehydrogenase is responsible for converting pyruvate into acetyl-CoA, which is then converted into ATP through the citric acid cycle.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
