["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about cystic fibrosis (CF), which is a genetic disorder. The statement 'Abnormality in CFTR which leads to defective calcium transport' does not seem relevant to the disease. The statement 'Autosomal recessive disorder' is true as cystic fibrosis is an autosomal recessive condition. The statement 'Mutation in cystic fibrosis transport regulator' seems correct as well, since the CFTR gene is responsible for producing the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator protein which is mutated in this disease. Therefore, only option B does not seem to be related to cystic fibrosis.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
