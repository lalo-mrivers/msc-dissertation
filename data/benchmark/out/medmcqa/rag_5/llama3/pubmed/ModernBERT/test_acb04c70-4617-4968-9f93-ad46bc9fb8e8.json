The provided documents are related to different topics such as the preparation of testosterone and 17-methyltestosterone from hyodeoxycholic acid, isotopic effect in enzymatic oxidation of methane, acid-base equilibrium in the blood of sheep, detection of mannitol formation by bacteria, and study on the degradation products of mecinarone.
