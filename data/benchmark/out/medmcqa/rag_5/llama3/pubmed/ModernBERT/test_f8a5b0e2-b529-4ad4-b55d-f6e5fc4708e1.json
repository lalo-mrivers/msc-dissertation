["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The problem is about a screening test with a sensitivity of 95% and specificity of 80%. The prevalence of the disease in the population is 20%. We need to find the positive predictive value (PPV) of the test. PPV = TP / (TP + FP), where TP is true positives and FP is false positives. Since we know the prevalence, we can calculate TP as follows: Prevalence x Total Population = Total Number of People with Disease. This means that 20% of 10000 people have the disease. So, there are 2000 people (10000 * 0.2) who actually have the disease. Since sensitivity is 95%, we know that out of these 2000 people, 1905 (95% of 2000) will test positive. This means that TP = 1905. Now, to calculate FP, we need to find the number of false positives from the total number of people who test positive (TP + FP). Since specificity is 80%, this means that out of the remaining 8995 people (10000 - 2000), 1792 (20% of 8995) are false positives. This gives us: TP + FP = 1905 + 1792 = 3697. Now, we can calculate PPV as follows: PPV = TP / (TP + FP) = 1905 / 3697 = 0.5163 or approximately 51.63%. Since the question asks for a percentage, we need to multiply this by 100 to get the final answer.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
