["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To understand how skeletal muscles contract, I'll start with the basic process of muscle contraction. Muscle contraction is initiated by calcium binding to troponin, which causes a conformational change that exposes myosin-binding sites on actin filaments. Then, actin and myosin filaments shorten, leading to muscle contraction.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
