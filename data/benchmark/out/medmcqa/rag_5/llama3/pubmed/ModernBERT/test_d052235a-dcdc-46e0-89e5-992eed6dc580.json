["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the red blood cells in beta thalassemia. We can start by looking at the relevant documents. The document '[Frequency of thalassemia in the South-East of France]' talks about thalassemia and its characteristics. It mentions that patients with microcytosis are likely to be thalassemic, and that foetal hemoglobin, electrophoresis on cellulose acetate, and level of hemaglobin A2 by the technique of miniature chromatography on DEAE-cellulose have been analyzed in these patients. This suggests that beta thalassemia is characterized by microcytic red blood cells. The document '[Ferquency of thalassemia in the South-East of France]' also mentions an incidence 2% of beta-thalassemia in the Nice region, which further supports the idea that beta thalassemia is characterized by microcytic red blood cells. Therefore, based on this information, we can conclude that the answer to the question is B: Microcytic and hypochromic.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
