["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about a 22-year-old college boy with a genital lesion after having sex with commercial workers. The relevant document that comes to mind is the 'Penal bone of American mink (Mustela vison Brisson, 1756)' which mentions the presence of a penis bone in male minks. This leads me to think about the possibility of a similar condition in humans, specifically genital lesions. Another relevant document is 'White piedra' which describes a fungal infection causing asymptomatic white nodules on public hair. However, this doesn't seem directly related to the question. Considering the boy's history and the lesion location, I'm going to focus on the possibility of an STI or viral infection.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
