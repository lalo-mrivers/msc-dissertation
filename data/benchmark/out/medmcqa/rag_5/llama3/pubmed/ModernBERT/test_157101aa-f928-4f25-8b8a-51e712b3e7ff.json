["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"In this question, we are looking for a term that describes the probability of a test detecting a truly positive person from the population of diseased. From the given documents, it is clear that we are dealing with a binary trait (presence or absence of disease). Therefore, I will consider the options related to binary traits. The specificity of the test refers to the proportion of true negatives among all individuals who test negative. This is not what we are looking for. The positive predictive value of the test is the probability that someone with a positive test result truly has the disease. This seems more relevant. However, it only considers people who tested positive, whereas our question asks about detecting a truly positive person from the population of diseased. This eliminates options A and B. Sensitivity refers to the proportion of true positives among all individuals who truly have the disease. This is closely related to our question, but not exactly what we are looking for. The likelihood ratio describes the ratio of the probability of a positive test result given that someone has the disease to the probability of a positive test result given that they do not have the disease. This is another term that relates to binary traits and is relevant to this question.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
