["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about a drug that affects the dilator pupillae, which is responsible for pupil dilation. Pilocarpine affects the sphincter papillae, which is responsible for pupil constriction. Therefore, we need to find a drug that has an opposite effect on the dilator pupillae compared to pilocarpine's effect on the sphincter papillae. Pilicarpine causes pupil constriction, so we are looking for a drug that causes pupil dilation.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
