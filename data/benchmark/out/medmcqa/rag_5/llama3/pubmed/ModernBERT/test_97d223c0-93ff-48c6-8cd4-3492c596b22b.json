["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To calculate the pulmonary compliance, we need to first find the change in intrapleural pressure (ΔP) and the tidal volume (V). Given values: ΔP = -9 cm of water - (-4 cm of water) = 5 cm of water. V = 500 mL. Pulmonary compliance (C) is calculated as C = V / ΔP. So, we need to convert cm of water into units that can be used with milliliters. There are 10 mmH2O in 1 cm of water, so -9 cm of water is equivalent to -90 mmH2O and -4 cm of water is equivalent to -40 mmH2O. This gives ΔP = -50 mmH2O. Finally, C = V / ΔP = 500 mL / (-50 mmH2O) = approximately 0.02 L/mmH2O.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
