["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about a circulating antibody directed to intercellular cementing substance of stratified squamous epithelium. The relevant documents mention various antibodies, but none specifically related to this disorder. However, the document on 'Serum proteins and secretory component in human carious dentin' mentions significant localization of IgG, IgA, albumin, and transferrin in the deep lesion of 20 carious teeth. This suggests that there are circulating antibodies present in serum. The document on 'Identification of germ tube cell wall antigens of Candida albicans' discusses affinity-purified antibody to two components of germ tube cell wall extracts, but it does not relate to stratified squamous epithelium. The document on 'Cross-linked surface Ig attaches to actin' is about the association between surface Ig and cellular actin, which does not seem relevant to this disorder.\n\nThe document on 'Somatic stability of variant C-band heterochromatin' discusses prominent C-band markers in different tissues and during long-term culture, but it does not mention anything related to circulating antibodies or stratified squamous epithelium. The only remaining possibility is the document on 'Characteristics of human prostatic cell cultures', which does not provide any information about circulating antibodies.\n\nThe relevant documents do not provide a clear answer. However, considering the option A: Lichen planus as it is an autoimmune disorder and there might be circulating antibodies directed to intercellular cementing substance of stratified squamous epithelium.\", \n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
