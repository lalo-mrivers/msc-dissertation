["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about preparing an elastic impression before pouring. The relevant documents describe various dental materials and techniques, but none of them specifically mention washing an elastic impression with a slurry of water and stone. However, the document on 'A new type of hydraulic dental cement' mentions that this cement consists of a mixture of cement powder and setting agent powder and therefore has only to be kneaded with a little amount of water when being used.
