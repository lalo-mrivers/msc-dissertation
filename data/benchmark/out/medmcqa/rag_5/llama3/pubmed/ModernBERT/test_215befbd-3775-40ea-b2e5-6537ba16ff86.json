["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the document 'Distribution of the A blood-group activity in porcine serum', we know that HDL carries roughly 50% of the lipidic A activity. This tells us that HDL is enriched in lipid-bound A blood-group activity compared to other lipoproteins like VLDL and LDL, which contain roughly 25% each. Since we are looking for what is maximum in HDL compared to other lipoproteins, we can conclude that the A blood-group activity is maximum in HDL.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
