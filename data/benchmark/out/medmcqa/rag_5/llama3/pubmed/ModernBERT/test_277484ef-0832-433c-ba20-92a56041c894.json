["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for the surest sign of a cyanotic spell in a child with tetralology of Fallot. Tetralogy of Fallot is a congenital heart disease characterized by increased pulmonary resistance and decreased systemic oxygenation, which can lead to cyanosis. Fever and diarrhea are common presentations in children with this condition. A cyanotic spell is an episode of deoxygenated blood entering the systemic circulation, causing a sudden increase in cyanosis. The literature provided does not explicitly mention tetralogy of Fallot or cyanotic spells. However, we can draw parallels from the presented cases. Corvisart's syndrome and Cogan's syndrome do not provide relevant information for this question. Caffey's disease is an infantile cortical hyperostosis condition that does not relate to cardiac conditions like tetralogy of Fallot. Dicephalus tribrachius is a rare congenital anomaly, but it also does not provide relevant information for this question.\n\nThe provided literature on Bowen's disease and Lewisite scar does not mention anything about tetralogy of Fallot or cyanotic spells. However, we can consider the general principles of cardiac conditions like tetralogy of Fallot. In a child with tetralogy of Fallot, a cyanotic spell is characterized by a sudden increase in cyanosis due to deoxygenated blood entering the systemic circulation.\n\nGiven this information, the surest sign of a cyanotic spell in a child with tetralogy of Fallot would be the presence of increased cyanosis, such as blue-tinged skin or mucous membranes. Aerial oxygen saturation of less than 75% could be an indirect indicator of a cyanotic spell, but it is not a direct sign.\n\nIn this case, the surest sign of a cyanotic spell would be the physical examination findings of increased cyanosis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
