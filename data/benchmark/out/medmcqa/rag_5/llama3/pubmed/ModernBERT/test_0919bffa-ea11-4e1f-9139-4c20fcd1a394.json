Another document discusses a typodont suitable for teaching correct bracket positioning, but it does not provide information on wax patterns. Autolok band is a braided polyester band used for retinal detachment, which is not related to making indirect wax patterns. The article on coiled springs mentions radiological terminology, but it does not provide any information on wax patterns. The article on microscope illumination discusses the 13-step KÃ¶hler method, but it does not provide any relevant information either. Finally, the device for measuring roentgenographic structures is used to measure coronary vessels and other structures, which is also unrelated to making indirect wax patterns. Based on this analysis, we can conclude that modeling wax is the correct choice.\", \"answer_choice\": B}"]
