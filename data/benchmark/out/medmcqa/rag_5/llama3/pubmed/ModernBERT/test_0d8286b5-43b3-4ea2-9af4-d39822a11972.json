["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about how dry heat destroys microorganisms. The provided documents describe various topics such as heat stress, spore survival, thermoregulatory problems, microwave oven for melting laboratory media, and equipment logging system. None of these topics explicitly mention the mechanism of destruction by dry heat. However, one document mentions that bacterial spores are protected against thermal denaturation by high fat-low water content environment which results from drying materials at temperatures below those required for sterilization. This suggests that high temperature is necessary to destroy microorganisms. Therefore, I will look for options related to protein or DNA damage, as high heat typically causes coagulation of proteins and denaturation of DNA.\", \"answer_choice\": D}"]
