["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has difficulty naming things and repetition is poor. This suggests a problem with language production, specifically with lexical retrieval. Comprehension, fluency, and understanding written words are unaffected, which rules out global cognitive impairment or severe dementia. The patient's symptoms are more specific to language processing. Anomic aphasia is characterized by impaired naming but preserved comprehension, which fits the patient's description.
