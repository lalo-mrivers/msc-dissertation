["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Von-Gierke's disease is a rare genetic disorder characterized by impaired glycogen breakdown. The primary symptoms are muscle weakness, tiredness, and a lack of energy. Ketosis is a feature of this condition as the body is unable to break down glucose effectively, leading to an accumulation of ketones in the blood. Considering these facts, I think step-by-step about what other findings would be associated with Von-Gierke's disease and ketosis.\n\nThe patient would likely have hypoglycemia due to impaired glycogen breakdown, which would not be surprising given the diagnosis. Low blood sugar levels are also a characteristic feature of this condition. Oxaloacetate is required for gluconeogenesis in the liver, which is impaired in Von-Gierke's disease, so it makes sense that oxaloacetate would be involved.\n\nHowever, low fat mobilization doesn't seem directly related to the pathophysiology of Von-Gierke's disease and ketosis. Patients with this condition are more likely to have issues with glucose metabolism rather than fat metabolism.\n\nAfter considering these points, I think step-by-step that the correct answer is D: Low fat mobilization.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
