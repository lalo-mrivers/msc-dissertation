["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the effect of enlarged adenoids on maxillary growth. I will look for relevant information from the provided documents. Since the documents are mostly about different topics such as trophic influence, organic constipation, somatosensory evoked responses, and endoarterial dispositives, none of which seem to be directly related to adenoid growth or its effect on maxilla. The only document that could potentially be relevant is the first one, 'Critical comment on the \"trophic\" influence of the effector organ on the sympathetic nerves of the male sex accessories of the guinea-pig'. However, even this does not seem to have any direct connection with adenoids or maxillary growth. Therefore, based on the information provided, it seems that there is no clear answer from these documents.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
