["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the fat content in expressed breast milk of pre-term infants compared to term infants. The relevant documents are about newborns' adaptation, fat absorption, breath hydrogen excretion, and arm circumference measurements. None of these studies provide direct information on fat content in breast milk. However, one study compares the distribution of body fat between breast-fed and formula-fed infants. This suggests that a comparison study might be suitable for this research question.\n\nAnother relevant document is about postpartum adaptation of naturally delivered newborns. Although it does not directly relate to fat content in breast milk, it highlights the importance of considering the infant's age and gestational age when conducting studies on newborns.\n\nConsidering these factors, I think a prospective cohort study (option B) would be the most suitable design for this research question. This is because it allows for the comparison of pre-term and term infants over time, which could provide valuable insights into the differences in fat content in expressed breast milk between these two groups.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
