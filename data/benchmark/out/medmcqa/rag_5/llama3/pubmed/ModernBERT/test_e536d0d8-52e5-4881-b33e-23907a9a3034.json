["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the typical radiographic appearance of osteosarcoma. I will review the relevant documents to find a description that matches one of the options. In 'Osteosarcoma of the mandible', there is no mention of radiographic appearance. Similarly, in 'Renal liposarcoma: case report' and 'Sonographic appearance of plasmacytoma of the testis', the focus is on different types of cancer and their ultrasound appearances or angiographic findings, respectively. The document 'Osteosarcoma arising in osteogenesis imperfecta' does not provide a detailed description of radiographic appearance either. However, I found a mention of osteosarcoma in general in 'Osteoid osteoma of the foot', which briefly discusses the symptoms and characteristics of osteosarcoma, but it doesn't provide specific information about the radiographic appearance.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
