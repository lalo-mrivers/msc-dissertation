["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the maximum voltage of R wave in an ECG with a 'mean' axis of 90deg. Since the axis is 90deg, it means the QRS complex will be equally positive and negative, so the mean voltage (average) will be zero. However, we know that the maximum voltage of R wave is always recorded in lead II. The leads I and III are orthogonal to each other and have a zero average voltage for a 'mean' axis of 90deg.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
