["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is on a fat-free carbohydrate-rich diet. This means triglyceride levels will rise with increased carbohydrate intake (from the first document). Carbohydrate is converted to glucose which increases blood glucose levels and insulin requirements. The patient continues to grow obese, indicating an increase in triglycerides or VLDL.
