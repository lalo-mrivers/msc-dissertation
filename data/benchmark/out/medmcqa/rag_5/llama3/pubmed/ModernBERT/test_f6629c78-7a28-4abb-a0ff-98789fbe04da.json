["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Since the question is asking about the rise of blood flow if the radius of blood vessels is increased by 50%, I will look for a relevant document that discusses the relationship between vessel radius and blood flow. The closest document is 'A mathematical analysis of the disk-sphere transition of the human red cell.' This document does not directly answer the question, but it provides information about the effect of shape on volume. However, another document, '[Mechanism of ulcers]', discusses the relationship between tensile stress and ulcer size, which suggests that increasing vessel radius could lead to increased blood flow.\", \"answer_choice\": C}"]
