["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"In this question, we are looking for the periodontal fibers that are consistent and reconstructed even after the destruction of the alveolar bone. From the provided documents, specifically 'Relationship between vital pulp and deep periodontal pockets', it is mentioned that the relationships between vital pulp and deep periodontal pockets are discussed. This suggests that the question might be related to periodontal fibers. Furthermore, we can see that the destruction of the alveolar bone does not affect the reconstruction of these fibers. Therefore, we can conclude that the correct answer is D: Transseptal as these fibers are known for their ability to reconnect even after bone loss.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
