["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, specifically the document about esthetic restorations and occlusal stress, I can infer that the direct bonded orthodontic stainless steel brackets derive retention with composite. The key point is that these brackets use a hybrid composite for reconstruction, which implies that the composite provides an effective bonding mechanism. This is further supported by the fact that the results are excellent functionally or aesthetically. Therefore, it is likely that the retention of the brackets comes from a combination of mechanical and chemical interlock with the tooth surface.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
