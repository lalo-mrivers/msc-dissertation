["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with sudden severe bilateral loss of vision, more so on the right side. The fact that she can still touch her fingers together with her right eye closed but not with her left eye closed suggests that there is a difference in the visual perception between the two eyes. This is similar to the case presented earlier where optic ataxia was caused by bilateral lesions strategically placed to disconnect motor cortex from visual input. The patient's symptoms do not fit well with anterior ischemic optic neuropathy or CMV retinitis, as these conditions typically cause a loss of vision in one eye or a gradual loss of vision over time. Functional vision loss is also unlikely as the patient has no perception of light and is able to touch her fingers together with her right eye closed.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
