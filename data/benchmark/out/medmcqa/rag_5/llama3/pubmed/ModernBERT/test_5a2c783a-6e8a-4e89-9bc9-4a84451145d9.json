["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about criteria for admission in upper GI bleed. The provided documents are unrelated to gastrointestinal bleeding or patient admissions. Therefore, we need to rely on general medical knowledge and standards. A quick search reveals that the Shock Index is a recognized criterion for determining the severity of bleeding. It's defined as the ratio of heart rate to systolic blood pressure. Hematocrit is also a relevant value in assessing anemia and blood loss.

It's more related to overall patient condition and shock.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
