["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks why glucose-6-phosphate, freshly synthesized during glycogenesis in the cytoplasm of hepatocytes, is not immediately degraded by the enzyme glucose 6-phosphatase. We know that glycogen synthesis and breakdown take place in the same cell with enzymes necessary for both pathways. Since glycogenesis occurs in the cytoplasm, it's likely that glucose-6-phosphate is being used to synthesize glycogen. Glucose 6-phosphatase would typically degrade glucose-6-phosphate, but since glycogenesis is occurring, this degradation wouldn't make sense. Therefore, the answer lies in the regulation of these enzymes.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
