["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about what to do with IOL (Intraocular Lens) placed in a young male after 10 years. The relevant document that comes close to this topic is 'The road to recovery for elders after CABG' which talks about octogenarians undergoing CABG again, but it's not directly related to IOL or eye care. However, we can consider the document on longevity and study of a case of a 105-year-old man, as it might provide some insight into age-related issues. Unfortunately, none of these documents explicitly discuss IOL removal or replacement after 10 years. Therefore, we must rely on general knowledge and principles. Posterior Capsule Ossification (PCO) is a common complication following IOL implantation, where the posterior capsule of the lens thickens and becomes cloudy over time. This condition can affect the vision of the patient. Given that the question specifically mentions 'Posterior Capsule ossification', it's reasonable to assume that the correct answer is related to PCO. Therefore, we should consider option A: IOL should be removed in case of Posterior Capsule ossification.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
