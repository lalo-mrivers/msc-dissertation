["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"No relevant documents mention intra-epithelial bulla. However, I found a document mentioning 'bulla' which is related to blistering. The document '[Luxatio pedis subtalo]' mentions dislocation and injury but not blisters. Another document '[Posttraumatic alterations demonstrated by isotope cisternography (author's transl)]' discusses scintigraphy of spinal and cranial liquor spaces but does not mention intra-epithelial bulla. A case report '[Long trips of intra-uterine devices in tropical areas (author's transl)]' mentions an unnoticed intra-uterine device, which is unrelated to blisters. Finally, I found a document '[Permanence of the endemy of human anthrax in Lower Casamance (author's transl)]' discussing cases of anthrax but not mentioning intra-epithelial bulla. The most relevant document is [Unusual cranio-cerebral injuries: report of two cases in Nigerians] which discusses unusual head injuries, including the risk to the superior sagittal sinus, but does not mention blisters or intra-epithelial bulla.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
