["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for the SI unit of X-ray. After reviewing the provided documents, none of them seem to be directly related to X-rays or radiation units. However, one document talks about myelography with Dimer-X, which involves X-ray contrast agents. This gives us a hint that we might find some relevant information in this document. Upon closer reading, we find that the document discusses complications after myelography and mentions Gray as a unit of measurement for absorbed dose. Given that this is an SI unit, it's likely to be the correct answer.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"]
