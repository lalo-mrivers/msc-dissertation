["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks what should be done when complete denture teeth are in edge-to-edge contact in centric occlusion. Based on the provided documents, it seems that edge-to-edge contact is an issue that needs to be addressed for proper dental alignment and function. The document 'Dental rotation in cleft lip' mentions adjusting rotated teeth into normal position and occlusion. This suggests that edge-to-edge contact may not be ideal for proper dental alignment.\n\nThe document 'Occlusal migration of a filled root: report of case' describes how a tooth can migrate to compensate for lost tooth structure. This could lead to edge-to-edge contact if the denture teeth are not adjusted properly.\n\nIn light of these documents, it seems that adjusting the cusp inclination of the upper and lower incisors is necessary to prevent edge-to-edge contact and ensure proper dental alignment and function.\", \"answer_choice\": C}"]
