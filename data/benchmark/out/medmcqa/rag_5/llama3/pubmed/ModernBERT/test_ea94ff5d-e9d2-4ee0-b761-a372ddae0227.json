["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the patients' chief complaint when the interocclusal distance is increased beyond physiologic limits. The provided documents discuss various topics such as working cast verification, cranio-facial injuries, osteolysis, dislocation of the elbow joint, and roentgen-anatomy of the distal fibula. None of these topics seem directly related to the question. However, the description of articulated working casts in the 'Working Cast Verification' document mentions eliminating most occlusal adjustments required when the restoration is seated in the mouth. This implies that changes in interocclusal distance can affect the occlusion and potentially cause complaints. The documents do not explicitly discuss an increase in interocclusal distance beyond physiologic limits, but it seems likely that this would lead to an occlusal disharmony.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
