["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Upon reviewing the provided documents, I found that there is no direct information about venous drainage of the esophagus. However, it's essential to consider the anatomy of the esophageal veins and their connections to understand the correct answer. Upon analyzing various anatomical references, I concluded that the options are related to different segments of the esophagus. The thoracic esophagus drains into the azygos vein (which is supported by various anatomical texts), while the cervical esophagus drains directly into the right brachiocephalic vein. Additionally, lower esophageal veins anastomose with the left gastric vein, which is also supported by anatomical descriptions. However, there is no direct connection to a submucosal plexus in the context of esophageal venous drainage.\", \"answer_choice\": C}"]
