["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about bilateral medullary nephrocalcinosis in a 3-month-old infant. Medullary nephrocalcinosis is caused by the deposition of calcium oxalate crystals in the renal medulla. Infants with hyperoxaluria are at risk of developing medullary nephrocalcinosis. However, this option is not directly related to bilateral disease. Bartter's syndrome can cause medullary nephrocalcinosis but it is a rare condition and would not typically present as bilateral disease in an infant. Prolonged use of furosemide could potentially lead to electrolyte imbalances that may contribute to the development of medullary nephrocalcinosis. ARPKD is a genetic disorder characterized by autosomal recessive inheritance, which is unlikely to cause bilateral medullary nephrocalcinosis in an infant.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
