["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about randomization in a clinical trial. Since none of the provided documents explicitly discuss randomization or clinical trials, we need to look at general principles related to bias and study design. Randomization is a technique used to reduce selection bias and confounding in studies. It ensures that the treatment and control groups are comparable and reduces the likelihood of unintentional selection bias. However, it does not increase external validity, as the results may not generalize well to other populations or settings. Therefore, we can eliminate options D and look at the remaining choices.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
