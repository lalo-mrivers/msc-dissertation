["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for a condition where Infective endocarditis is not seen. Endocarditis typically affects valves or septa of the heart. ASD (Atrial Septal Defect) and VSD (Ventricular Septal Defect) are congenital defects that do not have valves, so they are less likely to develop infective endocarditis. TOF (Tetralogy of Fallot) is a complex condition with four components, but it can still develop infective endocarditis. MR (Mitral Regurgitation) is a condition where the mitral valve does not close properly, making it more susceptible to infective endocarditis.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
