["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has received full Rabies vaccination in December 2018. Therefore, the child already has anti-Rabes immunity. However, there is an oozing wound on the Great toe and the pet had also been vaccinated. This information does not provide any direct correlation between the wound and rabies. The relevant document [On the presence of anti-rubella immunity in a population of Florence province (author's transl)] mentions that a larger diffusion of vaccination with RA-27/3 vaccine, followed by a recall after some years, is recommended. However, this information does not apply to Rabies vaccination.\n\nRelapsing tetanus can occur when the wound is contaminated and the patient has had an incomplete or ineffective primary vaccination. The case report Relapse of tetanus in a child: a case report suggests that such relapses can occur due to foreign bodies being present in the wound.\n\nGiven this information, it is likely that the oozing wound on the Great toe may be contaminated with foreign material and could potentially lead to Tetanus rather than Rabies. Therefore, the next line of management should focus on Tetanus prophylaxis rather than Rabies.\n\nThe relevant document [Experiences with transumbilical cannulation of the portal vein. Review of 180 consecutive cases] does not provide any information related to this scenario.\n\nThe case report Penetrating wound of the orbit: a 31-year follow-up is unrelated to this scenario and provides no useful information for this patient.\n\nCretinism in Angora goats is also an irrelevant document, as it deals with goiter and hypothyroidism in goats, not Tetanus or Rabies in humans.\n\nThe relevant document [On the presence of anti-rubella immunity in a population of Florence province (author's transl)] does not provide any information related to this scenario either.\n\nGiven these findings, the patient should receive RIG (Rabies Immune Globulin) and 5 doses of vaccine.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B: RIG + 5 doses of vaccine\"\n}"]
