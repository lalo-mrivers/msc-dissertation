["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Upon examining the provided documents, I noticed that none of them explicitly mention 'holocrine gland' or a specific marker for it. However, one document discusses Ringed enamel hyperplasia, which is an apparently new disorder of enamel. This doesn't seem relevant to the question about holocrine glands. The KÃ¶hler method article discusses microscope illumination settings, but again, this isn't related to holocrine glands. The Barbers' interdigital hair sinus and A 2 hand phantom articles also don't mention anything about holocrine glands. Finally, [Rare variation of the cubital artery] is a rare abnormality of the ulnar artery, which doesn't seem relevant to the question either.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"None of the above (not among the given options)\""]
