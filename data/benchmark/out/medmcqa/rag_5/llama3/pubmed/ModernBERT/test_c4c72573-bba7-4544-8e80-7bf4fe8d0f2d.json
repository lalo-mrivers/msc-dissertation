["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about instruments required for tonsillectomy. I will review the provided documents to see if they provide any information related to tonsillectomy or its procedures. In the document 'Tonsilloadenoidectomy. Personal observations in 15,000 cases.', it describes preoperative assessment, operative technique, treatment of postoperative haemorrhage, aftercare, and results. However, it does not mention specific instruments used for the procedure. Therefore, I will focus on the question's options to see if any of them match the instruments mentioned in other documents. Since none of the provided documents discuss tonsillectomy or its procedures, I will make an educated guess based on my medical expertise and common practices in otolaryngology.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
