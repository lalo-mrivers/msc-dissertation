["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Nitrous oxide alone is used as a G.A agent but we are asked what makes it not suitable for use alone. The relevant document mentioning nitrous oxide is 'Chloroform or ether-a literary question.' There is no mention of nitrous oxide in this document. The other documents do not seem to be directly related to the use of nitrous oxide as a G.A agent either. However, we can look into general characteristics of nitrous oxide which are widely known. Nitrous oxide is a good anesthetic but it does not provide adequate analgesia and also has some disadvantages like difficulty in maintaining an adequate oxygen concentration during its use. Therefore, based on these general characteristics, option A seems the most plausible answer.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
