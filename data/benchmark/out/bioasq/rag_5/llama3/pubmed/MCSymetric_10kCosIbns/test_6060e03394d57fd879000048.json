["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about synonymous sites in primates and rodents. Upon reviewing the relevant documents, I noticed that none of them specifically address the functional constraint on synonymous sites in these groups. However, one document (Evolutionary conservation of large chromosomal segments reflected in mammalian gene maps) does discuss the conservation of genetic linkage over long periods of time, including the phenomenon of differential silencing of genes. This suggests that certain sequences may be functionally constrained for a reason. Additionally, another document (Rapid speciation and chromosomal evolution in mammals) mentions the importance of demes and population size on evolutionary rates, which could potentially affect the constraint on synonymous sites. However, there is no direct evidence to support or refute functional constraint on synonymous sites in primates and rodents.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
