["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks if Impetigo is a viral infection that affects the skin. The relevant documents do not provide direct evidence of the viral nature of Impetigo. However, they do provide information on the etiology of Impetigo contagiosa. In 'Epidemiological aspects of impetigo contagiosa in western Sweden', it is mentioned that Staphylococcus aureus was the only organism isolated in 72.5%, beta-hemolytic streptococci, group A, in 10%, and both pathogens in 15%. This suggests that Impetigo contagiosa may be caused by bacterial infections rather than viral infections. Similarly, 'Impetigo contagiosa--etiology in Iraq' mentions the isolation of staphylococci and streptococci, as well as gram-positive diplococci, but does not mention viruses. 'Ultrastructure of pustules in impetigo herpetiformis' provides information on the histopathology of Impetigo, but does not provide etiological information. 'Streptococcal impetigo and acute glomerulonephritis in children in Cairo' provides further evidence that Streptococcus pyogenes is a common cause of Impetigo contagiosa. Finally, 'Predisposing factors of the skin surface in persons with impetigo contagiosa' does not provide information on the etiology of Impetigo. Based on these documents, it appears that Impetigo contagiosa may be caused by bacterial infections rather than viral infections.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B: no\""]
