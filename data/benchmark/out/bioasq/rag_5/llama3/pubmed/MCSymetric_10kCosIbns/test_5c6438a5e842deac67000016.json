["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about recessive coding variants responsible for undiagnosed nonconsanguineous individuals. The provided documents talk about consanguinity analysis, molecular diagnosis of genetic disease, and atypical inheritance of hemogenetic markers. There is no direct mention of recessive coding variants or undiagnosed nonconsanguineous individuals. However, the documents do discuss genetic diseases caused by numerous recessive genes, such as mental retardation and congenital nerve deafness. This suggests that recessive genes can cause undiagnosed genetic conditions. Nevertheless, the answer cannot be solely based on this information. Further analysis is needed to determine whether recessive coding variants are responsible for the majority of undiagnosed nonconsanguineous individuals.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B: no\""]
