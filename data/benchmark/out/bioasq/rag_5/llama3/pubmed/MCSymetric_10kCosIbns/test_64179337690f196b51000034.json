["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents provided describe various statistical methods for regression analyses, including logistic regression, Cox regression, and maximum likelihood estimation. They also mention machine learning-based methods such as neural networks and recursive partitioning classification technique (CART). The study described in the second document compares the cross-validation performance of seven statistical models, including logistic regression, Cox regression, and CART. While it does not directly compare these methods to machine learning-based methods, it suggests that the performance of the best statistical model was marginally superior to that of other models. Overall, the documents do not provide conclusive evidence for or against the outperformance of machine learning-based methods over statistical methods.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B: no\""]
