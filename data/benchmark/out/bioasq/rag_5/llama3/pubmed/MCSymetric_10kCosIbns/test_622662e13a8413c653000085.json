["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about whether METTL3 methylates long noncoding RNAs. Looking at the provided documents, we can see that tRNA methylases are enzymes that modify transfer RNA (tRNA) and use S adenosylmethionine as a methyl donor. The methylation of tRNA is a post-transcriptional modification that is specific to each tRNA species and origin. There is no mention of METTL3 or long noncoding RNAs in the provided documents, so we need to rely on general knowledge of tRNA methylases and their properties. Based on our understanding of these enzymes, it seems unlikely that they would be capable of modifying long noncoding RNAs.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
