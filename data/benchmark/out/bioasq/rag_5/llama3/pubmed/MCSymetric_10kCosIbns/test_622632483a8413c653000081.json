["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks if disruption of immune regulation mechanisms is associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes, including preeclampsia. The relevant documents describe the involvement of immunologic dysfunction in preeclampsia's etiology. 'Immunologic aspects of pre-eclampsia' suggests that pre-eclampsia may be caused by a combination of maternal and paternal hyporesponsiveness together with fetal hyperresponsiveness. 'Pre-eclampsia--a state of mother-fetus immune imbalance' presents serial lymphocyte counts and function tests during and after pre-eclamptic pregnancies, indicating an immune imbalance between the mother, father, and child. 'Immunological aspects of pre-eclampsia' proposes a two-stage disease model for preeclampsia, where the first stage involves maternal immune intolerance to the fetal allograft, which can lead to immunologically mediated abortion. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that disruption of immune regulation mechanisms is associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes, including preeclampsia.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
