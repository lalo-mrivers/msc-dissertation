["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe HbA1c as a minor component of human hemoglobin resulting from non-enzymatic linkage of glucose with the NH2-terminal amino acid of the beta chain. Under normal conditions, HbA1c represents about 5% of total hemoglobin. The documents also mention that HbA1c increases in direct proportion to the duration and degree of hyperglycemia. This indicates a strong correlation between HbA1c levels and diabetic control. The studies mentioned in the documents confirm that HbA1c provides a useful means of evaluating the degree of diabetic control, with higher values recorded in cases of poor control and lower values in cases of excellent control.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
