["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The provided documents describe the role of DNA double strand breaks in ionizing radiation-induced killing of eukaryotic cells. The evidence suggests that DNA double stranded breaks are lesions relevant for cell killing and their induction and repair are important in understanding the biological effects of ionizing radiation. Additionally, damage to cellular DNA from particulate radiations emphasizes the importance of DNA double strand breaks and chromatin breaks in mammalian cells. Furthermore, the degradation of nucleic acid in aqueous solution by ionizing radiation suggests that radiation-induced single-strand breaks can be a major form of DNA damage caused by ionizing radiation. Therefore, it is clear that breaks in double stranded DNA are associated with ionizing radiation.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
