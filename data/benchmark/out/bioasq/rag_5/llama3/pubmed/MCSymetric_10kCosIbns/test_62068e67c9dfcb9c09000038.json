["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about using whole genome sequencing for diagnosis of mitochondrial disease. Mitochondrial diseases are associated with mitochondrial DNA mutations, duplications and deletions which impair the protein synthesis of the mitochondrial subunits of the respiratory chain complexes. Whole genome sequencing would include the analysis of both nuclear and mitochondrial genomes. The documents suggest that while mtDNA is maternally inherited and shows a distinct inheritance pattern, autosomal dominant and recessive nuclear genes can also cause abnormalities of mtDNA. Therefore, whole genome sequencing could potentially identify not only mtDNA mutations but also nuclear gene variants influencing mtDNA or its gene products. This information would be valuable for diagnosis and understanding the etiology of mitochondrial diseases.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
