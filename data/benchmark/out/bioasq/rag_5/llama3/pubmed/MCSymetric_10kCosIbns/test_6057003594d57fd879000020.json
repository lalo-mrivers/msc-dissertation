["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about major royal jelly proteins being similar to yellow proteins. None of the provided documents mention 'major royal jelly proteins' or 'yellow proteins'. The document on Xenopus laevis egg jelly coat only discusses the composition and structure of the egg jelly, not any proteins with those names. The other documents are about different topics: silk secretion in Trichoptera, lipid and polypeptide components of crystalline yolk system from Xenopus laevis, and anatomy and evolution of proteins displaying viral capsid jellyroll topology. Therefore, we cannot make a comparison between the two protein types mentioned in the question.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B\n}"]
