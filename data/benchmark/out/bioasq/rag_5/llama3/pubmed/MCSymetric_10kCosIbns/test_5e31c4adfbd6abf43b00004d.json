["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking whether mesothelioma is caused by asbestos exposure. The background information suggests that there are 'background' cases of mesothelioma that have causes other than exposure to asbestos dust. However, the majority of studies presented suggest a strong association between mesothelioma and asbestos exposure. For example, the epidermiologic relationship study found that 11% of cases had probable or possible asbestos exposure, while 40.2% had no known exposure. The malignant mesothelioma with minimal asbestos exposure study also suggests that even minimal exposure can produce the tumor. Additionally, the thirty-two cases of mesothelioma in Victoria, Australia: a retrospective survey related to occupational asbestos exposure study found a significant prevalence of pulmonary asbestos bodies in the tumour series compared to an unselected consecutive series of 200 routine autopsies. Finally, the environmental household exposures to asbestos and occurrence of pleural mesothelioma study suggests that non-occupational exposures to asbestos, such as domestic uses of asbestos, can also cause mesothelioma.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
