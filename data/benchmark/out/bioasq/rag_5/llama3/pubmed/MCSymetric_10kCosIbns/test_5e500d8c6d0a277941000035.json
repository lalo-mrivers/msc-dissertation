["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks whether αCGRP is a member of the CGRP family. To answer this, we need to look at the relevant documents provided. The first document describes the pharmacological characterization of CGRP1 receptor subtype in the vascular system of the rat, and it does not mention anything about αCGRP specifically. However, the second document talks about 8-37hCGRP, which is an amylin receptor antagonist that enhances the insulin response and perturbs the glucose response to infused arginine in anesthetized rats.
