["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The provided documents describe various aspects of yeast genetics, including chromosome analysis and gene mapping. There is no direct mention of topologically associated domains (TADs). However, the review on 'Global regulators of chromosome function in yeast' discusses several abundant DNA binding proteins involved in multiple aspects of chromosome function, but TADs are not explicitly mentioned. The other documents describe specific chromosomes or genes, and do not provide information about TADs.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
