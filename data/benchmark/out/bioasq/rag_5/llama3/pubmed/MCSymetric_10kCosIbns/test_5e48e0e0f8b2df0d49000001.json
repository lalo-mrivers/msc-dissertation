["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks if gut microbiota profiles are altered by irradiation. We have multiple studies that investigate the effects of radiation on intestinal microflora. In 'Influence of radiotherapy on intestinal microflora in cancer patients', we see that there is a significant decrease in intestinal microflora after the first radiation exposure, but all bacteria increased and reached basal values except Enterococcus faecium 1, lactobacilli, and total anaerobes. This suggests that gut microbiota profiles are indeed altered by irradiation. Similarly, in '[The intestinal microflora of persons subjected to a radiation lesion]', we see changes in the composition of lactic-acid bacteria and yeast isolation from defecations of patients. In 'The effect of irradiation upon the bacterial flora in patients with head and neck cancer', we also observe an increase in potentially pathogenic organisms as the effect of the irradiation increases.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
