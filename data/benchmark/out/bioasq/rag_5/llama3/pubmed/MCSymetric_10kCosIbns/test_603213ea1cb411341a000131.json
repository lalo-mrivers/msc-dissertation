["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents discuss membrane vesicles isolated from Escherichia coli ML 308-225, which are analyzed by crossed immunoelectrophoresis. The molecular architecture of these membrane vesicles is studied using crossed immunoelectrophoresis, and it is demonstrated that they retain the same sidedness as the membrane in the intact cell. This suggests that bacteria can release extracellular vesicles.\",\n\"answer_choice\": A"]
