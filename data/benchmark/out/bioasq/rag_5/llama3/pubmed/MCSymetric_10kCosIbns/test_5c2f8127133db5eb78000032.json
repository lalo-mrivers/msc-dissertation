["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The provided documents do not explicitly discuss whole-genome duplications or small-scale duplications in yeast. However, we can infer that the Ty1 family of repeated sequences in yeast (as described in 'Evidence for transposition of dispersed repetitive DNA families in yeast') consists of a 5.6 kilobase sequence including a noninverted 0.25 kb sequence of another repetitious family, 'delta', on each end. This suggests that the repeats can be associated with each other or disperse and show some sequence divergence between repeat units. Sequence alterations involving Ty1 elements have been found during the continual propagation of a single yeast clone over the course of a month. One region with a large number of delta sequences (SUP4) also shows a high frequency of sequence alterations when different strains are compared. This information does not provide direct evidence for or against whole-genome duplications being more divergent than small-scale duplications in yeast.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B: no\"\n}"]
