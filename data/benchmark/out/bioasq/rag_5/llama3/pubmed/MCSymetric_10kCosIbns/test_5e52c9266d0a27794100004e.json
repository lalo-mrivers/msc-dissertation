["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about AhR ligands inducing Cyp1a1. We know that AhR ligands like dioxin (TCDD) induce the expression of CYP1A1 gene. This is confirmed by multiple studies, including 'Mechanism of action of a repressor of dioxin-dependent induction of Cyp1a1 gene transcription', 'Dioxin-dependent activation of murine Cyp1a-1 gene transcription requires protein kinase C-dependent phosphorylation', and 'Phorbol esters inhibit the dioxin receptor-mediated transcriptional activation of the mouse Cyp1a-1 and Cyp1a-2 genes by 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin'. Therefore, it can be concluded that AhR ligands do induce Cyp1a1.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A: yes\"\n}"]
