["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Enhancer-blocking assay suggests that domain boundaries can restrict enhancer activity to genes within the same domain. In the context of super enhancers, this would imply that they are structurally insulated in chromatin loops. Additionally, an enhancer-activated plasmid transcription complex contains constrained supercoils which may contribute to the insulation of super enhancers.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
