["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks if a comet assay measures radiation-induced mutations. The provided documents are related to genetic effects of induced ionizing radiations on populations, DNA base damage induced by ionizing radiation with biological end points, specific locus mutation rates after repeated small radiation doses to mouse oocytes, and molecular assays of radiation-induced DNA damage. None of these documents specifically mention a comet assay or its relation to measuring radiation-induced mutations. Therefore, the answer is based on the available information.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
