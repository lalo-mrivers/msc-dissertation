["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking whether deflazacort is more efficient than prednisone/prednisolone for the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy. We can look at the first document, which states that a double-blind controlled trial in 28 Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) patients with Deflazacort (DF), an oxazoline derivative of prednisolone, showed statistically significant improvement in myometric muscle strength measurements, Scott Score and timed tests. This suggests that deflazacort is more efficient than prednisone/prednisolone for the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
