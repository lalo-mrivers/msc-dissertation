["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is whether brain-derived exosomes can carry APP molecules. From the provided documents, we can see that endosomal-lysosomal pathway for degradation of amyloid precursor protein (APP) was reported in one document. Additionally, synaptic vesicle membrane proteins interact to form a multimeric complex and biosynthesis and sorting of neuropeptides were discussed in other documents. Based on these findings, it is possible that APP molecules can be packaged into brain-derived exosomes.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
