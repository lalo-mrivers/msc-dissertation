["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents provide information on the health effects of space travel on astronauts. There is no direct mention of cancer risk in the provided texts. However, it can be inferred that the Apollo astronauts were exposed to heavy cosmic-ray exposure, which could potentially increase their risk for developing cancer. On the other hand, the sanatorium-health resort stage of medical rehabilitation of astronauts after long-term space flight showed beneficial development of readaptation and increase of functional capabilities and physical work capacity of crewmembers. This suggests that the effects of space travel on astronauts' health are not necessarily detrimental to their overall well-being. Therefore, it can be concluded that there is no definitive evidence to support the claim that astronauts are in higher risk for developing cancer.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B: no\""]
