["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to 'Patterns of bacterial colonization of human milk', all samples had bacterial growth, with a median of 8700 and mean of nearly 20,000. Similarly, 'Bacteriological criteria for feeding raw breast-milk to babies on neonatal units' states that 82% contained only commensal organisms coagulase-negative staphylococci and Streptococcus viridans, while 15% grew potential pathogens. 'The protective effect of human milk against infections...' suggests that human milk contains antibacterial factors such as lysozyme, lactoferrin, and immunoglobulins. Finally, 'Effect of storage processes on the bacterial growth-inhibiting activity of human breast milk' shows that fresh breast milk inhibits bacteria growth. Therefore, it can be concluded that there are microbes in human breast milk.\", \"answer_choice\": A}"]
