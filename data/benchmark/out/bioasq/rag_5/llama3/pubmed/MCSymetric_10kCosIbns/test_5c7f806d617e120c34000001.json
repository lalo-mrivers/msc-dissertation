["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The concept of tumour-specific antigens is constantly undergoing reappraisal with the development of more sensitive methods for their detection. It has been found that many 'new' antigens produced by human tumours or materials immunologically closely related to them are also present in non-neoplastic tissues, albeit in small amounts. However, other antigens still appear to exist almost entirely in or on tumour cells so that the antigens of human tumours may be subdivided into either tumour-associated macromolecules or tumour-specific antigens. The elucidation of the chemical nature of the tumour-specific antigens may result in important advances in cancer diagnosis and therapy.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
