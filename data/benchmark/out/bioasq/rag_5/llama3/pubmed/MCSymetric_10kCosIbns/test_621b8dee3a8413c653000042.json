["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe various methods for measuring lysozyme levels in different biological fluids. In the first document, it is stated that low levels of tear lysozyme were observed in patients with infective corneal ulcers, with the lowest levels seen in patients with bacterial corneal ulcers. This suggests that there may be a correlation between the type of infection and the level of lysozyme in tears. The second document describes a spectrophotometric method for quantifying lysozyme in human tears, which involves measuring the reduction of optical density of Micrococcus lysodeikticus suspension. According to this method, the level of lysozyme in tears was found to be 6.1 mg per milliliter hen egg lysozyme with a standard deviation of 1.57 mg per milliliter hen egg lysozyme or 1.5 mg per milliliter human tear lysozyme with a standard deviation of 0.39 human tear lysozyme.\", \"answer_choice\": A}"]
