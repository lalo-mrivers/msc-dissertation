["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks if pRETRO-SUPER is an adenoviral vector. None of the provided documents mention a 'pRETRO-SUPER' vector. However, some of the vectors mentioned in the documents are constructed for eukaryotic cells, contain Rous sarcoma virus-long terminal repeat (RSV-LTR) as the promoter/enhancer, or have T7 RNA polymerase. pEXPRESS is one such example. The other documents describe various vectors based on retroviruses, including D-type and C-type retroviral vectors. There is no mention of an adenoviral vector in any of these documents.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B: no\""]
