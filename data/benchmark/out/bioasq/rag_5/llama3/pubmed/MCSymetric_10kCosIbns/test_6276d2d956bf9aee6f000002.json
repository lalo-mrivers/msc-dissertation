["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about ACE inhibitors and ARBs increasing the likelihood of severe COVID-19. The provided documents are about ACE inhibitors, their side effects, and how they work. One document discusses ACE inhibitor-induced cough, which was a common side effect that resolved with withdrawal of the drug.
