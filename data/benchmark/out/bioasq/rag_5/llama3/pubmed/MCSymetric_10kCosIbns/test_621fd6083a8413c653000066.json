["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks whether RNA is methylated, but we have multiple documents discussing the methylation of ribosomal precursor RNA. In one document, it is mentioned that 2'-O-methylated oligonucleotides were found in mouse hepatoma MH 134, indicating that some parts of RNA can be methylated. Another document shows that nucleoli isolated from rat liver can methylate newly synthesized 45-S RNA. Finally, a comparison between the methylated nucleotide sequences in several vertebrate ribosomal ribonucleic acids reveals homologies between them. These findings suggest that RNA can be methylated.\", \"answer_choice\": B}"]
