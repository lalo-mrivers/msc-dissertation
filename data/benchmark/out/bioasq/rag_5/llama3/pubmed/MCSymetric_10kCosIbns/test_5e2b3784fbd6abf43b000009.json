["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to the expression of FGF-5 gene in the mouse embryo document, Fgf-5 RNA was detected at seven distinct sites during embryogenesis. The pattern of expression suggests that Fgf-5 functions in an autocrine manner to stimulate the mobility of cells or render them competent to respond to other inductive or positional signals. There is no indication that FGF-5 is only involved in late embryonic development. On the other hand, the document about Regulation and expression of a growth arrest-specific gene (gas5) during growth, differentiation, and development does not mention FGF-5 at all. The Prenatal expression of the growth hormone (GH) receptor/binding protein in the rat: a role for GH in embryonic and fetal development? document discusses the ontogeny of the GH receptor/binding protein from E12 to E18 rat fetus, but it does not mention FGF-5 either. Finally, Expression of DRG during murine embryonic development indicates that drg gene is expressed widely during embryonic development and is greatly reduced in newborn animals, but again there is no indication that GRG5 (which I assume refers to FGF-5) is only involved in late embryonic mouse development.\", \"answer_choice\": A}"]
