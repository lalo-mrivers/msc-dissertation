["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Losartan is an angiotensin II receptor antagonist that has been shown to inhibit neointima formation following balloon injury to rat carotid arteries. It also attenuates the vascular response to balloon catheter injury, and this effect was associated with functional block of vascular AT1 receptors. Losartan lowers blood pressure markedly in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and prevents the development of hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy. Additionally, it reduces intimal thickening following balloon catheterization of rat carotid arteries. None of these studies or the documents provided suggest any direct relevance to brain atrophy in Alzheimer's disease.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
