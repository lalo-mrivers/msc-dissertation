["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks whether yeast FBP1 is affected by glucose starvation stress. We need to look for relevant information about FBP1's response to glucose or its absence. The first document talks about the regulated degradation of FBPase in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which is subject to glucose-stimulated proteolytic degradation. This suggests that FBPase (and by extension, FBP1) is affected by glucose levels. However, there's no direct mention of starvation stress. The second document discusses the effects of glucose and nitrogen source on proteinases and peptidases, but it doesn't specifically address FBPase or its response to glucose starvation. The third document examines catabolite inactivation of gluconeogenic enzymes in mutants deficient in proteinase B, which is not directly related to FBP1's response to glucose starvation. The fourth document talks about the transcriptional activator gene FUP1/MSN1 and its role in carbon source regulation, but it doesn't provide information about FBP1's response to glucose starvation. Therefore, we can infer that FBP1 might be affected by glucose levels, but there is no conclusive evidence for a direct effect of glucose starvation stress.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
