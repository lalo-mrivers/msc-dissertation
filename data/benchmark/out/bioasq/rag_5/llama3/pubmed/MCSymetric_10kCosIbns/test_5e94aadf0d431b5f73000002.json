["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe Bcl-2 as an oncogene that inhibits apoptosis. The documents also mention the isolation of a chicken homologue of the human Bcl-2 oncoprotein, which suggests that Bcl-2 is not unique to humans and may be present in other species as well. Additionally, the documents highlight the role of Bcl-2 in preventing death of factor-deprived cells but failing to protect cells against T cell killing. Based on this information, it can be inferred that Bcl-2 is an anti-apoptotic protein.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
