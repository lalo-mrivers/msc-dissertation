["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe cardenolides as inhibitors of Na+/K+ ATPase. In the first document, it is mentioned that 22 C-3 branched cardenolides were investigated as inhibitors of beef-brain and dog-heart (Na+ + k+) activated adenosine triphosphatase. The synthetic compounds had lower inhibitory strength than digitoxigenin, indicating that cardenolides are indeed inhibitors of Na+/K+ ATPase. Additionally, the second document discusses the binding constants of cardenolides to human plasma proteins and their relationship with octanol-water partition coefficients, but does not mention anything about inhibition. The third document describes an in vitro inhibitor of Na-K-ATPase present in a commonly used preparation of ATP made by Sigma Chemical Company, which could be related to cardenolides as potential inhibitors. Finally, the fourth document discusses the essential carboxyls in the cation-binding domain of the Na,K-ATPase and mentions that treatment with DEAC results in enzyme inactivation, suggesting that cardenolides are indeed inhibitors of Na+/K+ ATPase.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
