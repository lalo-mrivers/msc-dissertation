["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks if mitochondria can pass through membrane nanotubes. There is no direct information provided about the ability of mitochondria to pass through membrane nanotubes in the given documents. However, it is mentioned that mitochondrial membranes have high-conductance pathways and that the outer and inner membranes have been studied using the patch clamp technique. Additionally, contact sites between the outer and inner membranes have been characterized electrophysiologically. This suggests that there may be some kind of communication or interaction between the different parts of the mitochondrial membrane. Therefore, it is possible to infer that mitochondria might not be able to pass through membrane nanotubes since they are a part of the mitochondrial membrane itself.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
