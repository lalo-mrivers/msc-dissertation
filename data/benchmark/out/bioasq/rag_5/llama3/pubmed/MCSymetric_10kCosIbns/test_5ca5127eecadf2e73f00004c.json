["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks if the collagen matrix of human articular cartilage changes with disease. Let's look at the relevant documents. In 'Collagen fibril structure of normal, aging, and osteoarthritic cartilage', it mentions that lesions of varying severity were seen within each of the three types; the morphological changes of the more severe lesions overlapped with those of clinically overt osteoarthritis. This suggests that the collagen matrix may change with disease.\n\nIn 'The collagen fibril organization in human articular cartilage', it is mentioned that there are different features of the organization of the collagen fibrils depending on the zone (superficial, deep, and middle). However, it does not specifically mention changes in the collagen matrix with disease.\n\nIn 'Reinterpretation of the ultrastructure of cartilage matrix', it is concluded that collagen plays a definite role in the formation of granules at the time of tissue fixation. This information does not provide any insight into whether the collagen matrix changes with disease.\n\nIn 'Correlation between articular cartilage collagenase activity and osteoarthritis', it is found that collagenase activity is primarily present in areas of moderately severe disease, but not in mild or end stage arthritis. This suggests that there may be changes in the collagen matrix with disease.\n\nFinally, in '[Destruction of cartilage in the adjuvants disease of the rat]', it is mentioned that a more fibrillar structure of the surface was seen in animals with arthritis as compared to untreated rats. This may suggest that the collagen matrix changes with disease.\n\nOverall, based on the information provided, it appears that the collagen matrix of human articular cartilage does change with disease.\",\n\"answer_choice\": A"]
