["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents suggest that propofol is metabolized by glucuronide and quinol sulphate. During the anhepatic phase of liver transplantation, the majority of the blood radioactivity was comprised of unchanged propofol, with some evidence of extrahepatic metabolism. In one subject, urinary radioactivity showed the main component to be propofol glucuronide during the anhepatic phase. This suggests that propofol is metabolized by glucuronidation and may result in green urine.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
