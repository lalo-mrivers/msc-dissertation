["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Mucins are characterized mainly by a high level of O-linked oligosaccharides. Additionally, mucin oligosaccharides are heterogeneous in size and structure but are chiefly O-linked, i.e., they initiate from N-acetylgalactosamine residues attached to threonine and serine residues of the polypeptide backbone. This indicates that mucins are glycosylated proteins.\", \"answer_choice\": A}"]
