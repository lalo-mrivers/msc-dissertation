["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, I will start by reviewing the information about T cells and human autoimmune thyroid disease. The document states that human T cells recognize self and foreign antigens when such antigens are processed into small peptides and bound to molecules coded for by genes of the HLA region on chromosome 6. It also mentions that in patients with Graves' disease, mainly helper T-cell clones have been obtained, whereas in autoimmune (Hashimoto's) thyroiditis cytolytic T-cell clones may be predominant.\n\nNext, I will consider the document about binding of peripheral blood and thyroidal T lymphocytes to thyroid cell monolayers. This study examines the binding of T cells from patients with Graves' disease and normals to human thyroid (THY) cells. The results show that interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) enhances the binding of peripheral blood T cells from patients with Graves' disease and normals, but not from patients with Hashimoto's thyroiditis.\n\nI will also review the document about thyroid-specific T cells in the normal Wistar rat. This study clones thyroid-specific T cells and characterizes their interaction with the cloned Wistar rat thyroid cell line (WRT). The results show that all the clones are of the CD4+CD8- phenotype, and seven of the 23 T cell clones proliferate in the presence of WRT cells alone or with the combination of WRT cells and thymocytes.\n\nFinally, I will consider the document about type 1 T helper and type 2 T helper cells. This review discusses the functions, regulation, and role in protection and disease of these two types of T cells. It highlights that most allergen- or helminthic antigen-specific CD4+ human T cell clones have a TH2 phenotype, whereas the majority of T-cell clones specific for mycobacterial antigens or antigens responsible for type IV hypersensitivity exhibit a TH1 phenotype.\n\nBased on this information, I will answer the question as follows.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A: yes\""]
