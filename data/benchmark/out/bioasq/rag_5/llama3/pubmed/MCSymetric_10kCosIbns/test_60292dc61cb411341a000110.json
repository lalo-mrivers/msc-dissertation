["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking if plants from the genus Strychnos are the original source of curare. The relevant documents provided information about the alkaloids present in various species of Strychnos, but there was no specific mention of curare. However, it can be inferred that since some species of Strychnos contain tertiary alkaloids, they might have been used to create curare-like compounds. Additionally, a search through the other documents did not reveal any information about curare or its origin.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
