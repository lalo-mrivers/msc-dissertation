["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about whether (D-Met2,Pro5)-enkephalinamide, also referred to as ESN364, activates the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis. According to the 'In vitro effects of a synthetic enkephalin analogue' document, 10(-7)--10(-5) M (D-Met2,Pro5)-enkephalinamide did not alter testosterone production and troph-hormone sensitivity of isolated Leydig cells, nor gonadotroph hormone release and LHRH sensitivity of isolated anterior pituitary cells. However, 10(-5)--10(-5) M synthetic enkephalin analogue induced a dose-dependent inhibition of LH-RH content and release of the mediobasal hypothalamus, which was prevented by equimolar concentrations of naloxone. This suggests that ESN364 may have an effect on the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, specifically on the inhibitory regulation of LHRH release.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
