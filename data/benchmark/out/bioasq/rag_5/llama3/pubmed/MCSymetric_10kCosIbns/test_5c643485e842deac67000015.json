["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant document that discusses regulatory mutations is 'Regulatory mutations and human genetic disease'. It explains that mutations in gene promoter/regulatory regions can cause human genetic disease by altering the binding behavior of trans-acting protein factors to specific DNA sequences. This type of mutation can either increase or decrease transcriptional activity. De novo mutations refer to new mutations that occur spontaneously, without prior family history. Neurodevelopmental disorders are a type of disorder that affects brain development. Based on this information, it is possible that de novo mutations in regulatory elements could contribute to neurodevelopmental disorders. Therefore, the answer is likely 'yes'.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
