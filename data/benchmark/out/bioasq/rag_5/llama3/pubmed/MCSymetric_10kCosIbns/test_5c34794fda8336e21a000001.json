["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the structure of yeast episomes and plasmids. The circular DNA molecules from genetically characterized clones of Saccharomyces cerevisiae have been studied by restriction endonuclease analysis and electron microscopy. The monomer molecule contains two inverted repeats of the same sequence situated opposite each other along the perimeter. This suggests that LTR (Long Terminal Repeats) can give rise to circular DNA.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
