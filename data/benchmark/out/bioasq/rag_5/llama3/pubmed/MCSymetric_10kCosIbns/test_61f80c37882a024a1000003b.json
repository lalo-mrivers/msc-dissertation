["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents discuss various genetic mutations that can cause epilepsy. The tottering (tg) mutation on chromosome 8 is mentioned as an example of a recessive trait that produces focal motor seizure patterns and behavioral absence seizures in young mice. Additionally, the genes for epilepsy mapped in the mouse suggest that complex inheritance patterns are involved, with at least two separate genes influencing the seizure phenotype. No specific mention is made of KCNT2 mutations or their relationship to epilepsy phenotypes.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
