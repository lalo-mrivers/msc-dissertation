["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The provided documents discuss various aspects of energy metabolism, enkephalins, and their effects on behavior. However, there is no direct mention of enhancers or their activity. Therefore, we must rely on general knowledge and common sense to answer this question. In biochemistry, an enhancer is a DNA sequence that increases the expression of a gene. To be active, an enhancer would need to bind to a specific protein or regulatory element, allowing it to exert its enhancing effect. The documents do not provide any information about enhancers binding to proteins or being activated. Therefore, based on our current understanding, accessible enhancers are not necessarily active.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B: no\""]
