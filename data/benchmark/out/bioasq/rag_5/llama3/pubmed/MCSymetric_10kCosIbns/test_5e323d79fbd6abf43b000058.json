["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The first document presents a study on postoperative irradiation of glioblastomas. It suggests that radiation can improve the survival rate of patients with glioblastoma. The second document describes cases where patients had received radiation therapy for primary brain tumours and later developed a secondary brain tumour. One case was a meningioma, and two were cerebral astrocytomas. There is evidence to show that moderate doses of ionising radiations given in childhood are associated with a late risk of developing a meningioma. The third document investigates the effects of radiation on glioma spheroid invasion into normal rat brain tissue in vitro. It suggests that irradiation can not prevent invasion of two different glioblastoma cell lines into fetal rat brain tissue. The fourth document presents a retrospective survey of patients with unbiopsied thalamic, pontine, and medullary tumors treated with radiation therapy. It demonstrates that 30% to 40% of patients have a 3-year survival rate with seven long-term survivors. Finally, the fifth document describes the results of fast-neutron-beam irradiation of glioblastoma multiforme in terms of neuropathological studies. It shows that extensive coagulative necrosis of much of the tumor mass and marked reduction in the amount of viable tumor are observed after radiation therapy.\n\nBased on these documents, it appears that radiation can cause secondary glioblastomas.\",\n\"answer_choice\": A"]
