["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about OXLUMO (lumasiran) which is a putative inhibitor of oxalate production or urinary oxalate excretion. There are no direct mentions of OXLUMO in the provided documents, but we can look for similar treatments that have been investigated or documented. We see that succinimide and isocarboxazide did not reduce urinary oxalate excretion, and pyridoxine reduced oxalate excretion in some patients. This suggests that OXLUMO might be a new treatment option for primary hyperoxaluria.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A: yes\""]
