["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The provided documents show that frequent losses were observed between loci defined by CI6-119 (D6S195) at 6q26 and CI6-49 (D6S161) at 6q27. A detailed deletion map indicated a commonly deleted region between loci defined by CI6-111 (D6S193) and CI6-24 (D6S149); these two markers are estimated to be 1.9 cM apart on the basis of linkage analysis. Our results further define a region containing a tumor suppressor gene involved in ovarian carcinoma within an approximately 2-megabase-long segment of chromosome 6q.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrequent losses were observed uniquely in serous and serous papillary cystadenocarcinomas; loss of heterozygosity was detected only rarely on this chromosomal arm in nonserous types of tumors. The average (0.12) of fractional allelic loss seen in mucinous cystadenocarcinoma, which usually has a better prognosis than other types, was much lower than that of other tumor phenotypes including serous cystadenocarcinoma (0.31) and clear cell carcinoma (0.20).\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
