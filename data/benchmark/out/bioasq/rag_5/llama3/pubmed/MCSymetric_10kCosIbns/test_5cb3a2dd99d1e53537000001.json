["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents are related to different proteins and their functions. The first document discusses Sec63p, an endoplasmic reticulum membrane protein required for secretory protein translocation. The second document talks about SP-63, a peroxisomal membrane protein in Lens culinaris. The third document is about the ME491/CD63 antigen gene and its promoter activity. The fourth document discusses the targeting of CD3 chains to lysosomes.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe question asks if CD63 is an exosomal marker. Based on the documents, it seems that CD63 is a protein involved in the ME491/CD63 antigen gene, which has been studied for its genomic structure and promoter activity. This suggests that CD63 might be related to cellular processes rather than exosomes.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, there is no direct evidence or mention of CD63 being an exosomal marker in any of the provided documents.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
