["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about Huntington's disease being caused by expansion of a CTG repeat in the HTT gene on Chromosome 4. The provided documents describe genetic analysis and linkage studies that mapped the HD locus to 4p16.3, but do not explicitly mention a CTG repeat or the HTT gene. However, they do mention the association of Huntington's disease with certain markers (D4S10, D4S95, D4S43) on Chromosome 4 and the complexity of linkage disequilibrium patterns in the region.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
