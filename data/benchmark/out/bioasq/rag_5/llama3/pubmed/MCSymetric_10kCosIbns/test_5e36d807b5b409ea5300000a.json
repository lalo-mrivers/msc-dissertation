["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the deposition of histones onto replicating chromosomes. In the provided documents, it is mentioned that newly synthesized histone was labeled with [3H]lysine and newly synthesized DNA was density-labeled with iododeoxyuridine. The study showed that the newly synthesized histone was randomly distributed over the chromosomal material and did not become associated specifically with immediately post-replicational DNA. This suggests that there is no specific mechanism for transferring histones to leading strand DNA at replication forks.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
