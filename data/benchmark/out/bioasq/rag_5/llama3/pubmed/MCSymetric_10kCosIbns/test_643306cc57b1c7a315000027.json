["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about detecting EGFR mutations in circulating DNA using CRISPR/Cas12a. The provided documents are related to PCR (polymerase chain reaction) and its variations, such as enriched PCR amplification, PCR regimen for enhanced specificity, and PCR-SSCP (single-strand conformation polymorphism). There is no direct information about CRISPR/Cas12a or EGFR mutations in these documents. However, the techniques described can be used for detecting point mutations in genomic DNA, including PCR-based methods like RFLP (restriction fragment length polymorphism) and SSCP. CRISPR/Cas12a is a new gene editing tool that is not relevant to this question. Therefore, we cannot conclude whether CRISPR/Cas12a can be used for detecting EGFR mutations in circulating DNA.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
