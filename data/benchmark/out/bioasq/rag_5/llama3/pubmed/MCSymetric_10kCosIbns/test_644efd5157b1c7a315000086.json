["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The first relevant document discusses the relationship between spontaneous mutation rates in vivo and in vitro. It highlights that cellular mutation rates should be much lower than what is observed in cultured cells, suggesting that cell culture environments may present an abnormal situation to somatic cells. The second document emphasizes the distinction between oncogenic potency of a cell genome and conditions that favour or prevent its realization. Epigenetic alterations are mentioned as causing neoplastic transformation of cells. The third document discusses genomic imprinting, which confers functional differences on parental chromosomes due to epigenetic inheritance from parental germlines. It also highlights the influence of epigenetic modifications on gene expression and phenotypic variations. The fourth document provides an overview of molecular genetic approaches to analyzing human inherited disease, including nonrandom nature of human gene mutation. Based on this information, it becomes clear that epigenetic changes are heritable.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A: yes\"\n}"]
