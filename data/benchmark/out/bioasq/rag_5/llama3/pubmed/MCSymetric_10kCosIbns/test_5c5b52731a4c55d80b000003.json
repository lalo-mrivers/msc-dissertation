["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"After reviewing the provided documents, I found that deletion at 6q24.2-26 is associated with serous ovarian tumors (Sato et al., Cancer Res., 51: 5118-5122, 1991). Frequent losses were observed between loci defined by CI6-119 (D6S195) at 6q26 and CI6-49 (D6S161) at 6q27. A detailed deletion map indicated a commonly deleted region between loci defined by CI6-111 (D6S193) and CI6-24 (D6S149); these two markers are estimated to be 1.9 cM apart on the basis of linkage analysis. Our results further define a region containing a tumor suppressor gene involved in ovarian carcinoma within an approximately 2-megabase-long segment of chromosome 6q.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
