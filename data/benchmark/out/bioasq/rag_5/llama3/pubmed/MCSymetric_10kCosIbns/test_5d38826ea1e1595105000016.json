["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to the first document, SATB1 binds selectively to nuclear matrix/scaffold-associating DNAs (MARs/SARs) which have unusual binding site recognition. It is mentioned that SATB1 recognizes the ATC sequence indirectly through the altered sugar-phosphate backbone structure present in the double-stranded DNA. This suggests that SATB1 positions itself close to AT-rich sequences, as it binds to these specific sequences and uses their structure for recognition.\", \"answer_choice\": A}"]
