["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The provided documents discuss various aspects of cytokeratin expression in normal and neoplastic tissues. The immunohistochemical study of lung carcinomas found that all cytokeratins reacted with virtually all adenocarcinomas, most squamous cell carcinomas, and 65% of large cell carcinomas. The characterization of the cytokeratins of human colonic, pancreatic, and gastric adenocarcinoma cell lines showed that these cell lines expressed combinations of cytokeratins 7, 8, 18, and 19, which are typical of the 'simple' epithelial pattern found in normal ductal and glandular tissues. However, pancreatic carcinoma cell lines expressed additional cytokeratins that are normally found in stratified squamous epithelium and epidermoid (squamous cell) carcinomas. Moreover, certain cytokeratin polypeptides identify squamous cell carcinomas, while others are typical of primary and metastatic urothelium-derived carcinomas. These findings suggest that cytokeratins can be used as a tumor marker.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
