["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the documents provided, I will analyze each statement to determine if there is any correlation between stretch enhancers and super-enhancers. From 'Enhancement of mechanical performance by stretch during tetanic contractions of vertebrate skeletal muscle fibres', it can be seen that the force enhancement after stretch did not depend on the velocity at which the stretch had been applied, but rather was dependent on sarcomere length and amplitude of stretch. This suggests that there may be different mechanisms for stretch enhancers and super-enhancers. Furthermore, 'Spinal mechanisms of the functional stretch reflex' suggests that the spinal cord plays a role in regulating muscle responses to torque perturbations, which could imply the existence of different types of stretch enhancers.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
