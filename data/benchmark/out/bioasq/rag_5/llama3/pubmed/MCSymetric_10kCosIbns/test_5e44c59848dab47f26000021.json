["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, it can be seen that tirilazad has been studied for its effects on cerebral ischemia. In one study, tirilazad did not improve early metabolic recovery following compression ischemia in dogs (Tirilazad mesylate does not improve early cerebral metabolic recovery following compression ischemia in dogs). However, it was found to reduce cortical infarction after transient but not permanent focal cerebral ischemia in rats (Tirilazad reduces cortical infarction after transient but not permanent focal cerebral ischemia in rats). Additionally, tirilazad has been shown to have no effect on cortical hypoperfusion following spreading depression in awake rats (Cortical hypoperfusion following spreading depression is not altered by tirilazad mesylate (U-74006F) in awake rats). Given these findings, it seems that the efficacy of tirilazad for treatment of ischemic stroke depends on the type and duration of ischemia.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B: no\""]
