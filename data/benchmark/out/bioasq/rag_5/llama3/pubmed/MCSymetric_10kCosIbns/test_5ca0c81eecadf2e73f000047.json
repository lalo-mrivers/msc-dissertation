["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks whether subdural empyema is a complication of sinusitis. We can analyze the relevant documents to answer this question. The first document describes 10 children who had sinusitis-induced subdural or extradural empyema. All patients had symptoms or signs suggestive of sinusitis, and their cases support that subdural empyema can be a complication of sinusitis. The second document reports three cases of subdural empyema with different courses and outcomes, where in all cases subdural empyema developed as a complication of chronic maxillary sinusitis. The third document analyzes 17 recent cases of subdural empyema and reviews the literature, concluding that para-nasal sinusitis is the most common cause of subdural empyema. Finally, the fourth document discusses the otolaryngologic management of patients with subdural empyema, where it is mentioned that 53% of the patients had empyemas caused by sinusitis. Therefore, based on these documents, we can conclude that subdural empyema can be a complication of sinusitis.\",\n\"answer_choice\": A"]
