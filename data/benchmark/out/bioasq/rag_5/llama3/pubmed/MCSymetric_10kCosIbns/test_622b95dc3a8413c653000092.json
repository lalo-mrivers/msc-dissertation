["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is whether retinol binding protein (RBP) 4 is an adipokine. An adipokine is a hormone produced by adipose tissue. According to the document 'Retinoids and retinoid-binding protein expression in rat adipocytes', RBP was expressed almost exclusively in adipocytes and only weakly in stromal-vascular cells. This suggests that RBP may be an adipokine. Additionally, another study found that RBP mRNA levels were not detected in preadipocytes but considerable RBP mRNA was present in differentiated adipocytes.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
