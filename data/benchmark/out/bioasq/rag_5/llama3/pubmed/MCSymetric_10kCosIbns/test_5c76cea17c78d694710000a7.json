["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking whether ADP-ribosylation is a post-translational modification (PTM). From the provided documents, it can be seen that ADP-ribosylation involves the transfer of ADPR from NAD to acceptor proteins. This process changes the charge, conformation and biological activity of the protein, which is a characteristic of PTMs. Therefore, ADP-ribosylation is considered a type of PTM.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
