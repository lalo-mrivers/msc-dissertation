["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents discuss the effects of bleomycin on lung tissue. In the first document, it is stated that the incidence of lung toxicity appeared to be lower when bleomycin was administered by slow infusion rather than intravenous bolus. This suggests that bleomycin can cause lung toxicity. In the second and third documents, the mechanisms of cell toxicity are described, which involve DNA damage and lipid peroxidation. These mechanisms can lead to alveolar cell damage and subsequent pulmonary inflammation. The fourth document discusses the pathogenesis of bleomycin lung toxicity, including morphological and functional modifications in type II pneumocytes, which may be an early stage of pulmonary damage. Overall, these documents suggest that bleomycin is capable of inducing lung toxicity.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
