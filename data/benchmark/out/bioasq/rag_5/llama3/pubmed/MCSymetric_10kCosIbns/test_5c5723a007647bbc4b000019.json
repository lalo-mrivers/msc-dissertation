["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about yeast prions becoming models for human amyloid diseases. The provided documents discuss various aspects of amyloid diseases, including the transmissible nature of some diseases, the role of mutations, and the deposition of amyloid proteins in different organs. While there is no direct mention of yeast prions, it can be inferred that the mechanisms underlying human amyloid diseases are complex and multifactorial. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that yeast prions may not be directly applicable as models for understanding these mechanisms.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
