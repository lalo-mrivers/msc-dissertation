["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Lubeluzole is also known as Sabeluzole. The study on cerebral effects of Sabeluzole showed that it increased the survival time in hypobaric hypoxia and anoxic hypoxia in mice, gasping in decapitation model, and survival in hemic hypoxia in rats. It also showed a weak effect in incomplete ischemia in rats. There is no direct study on Sabeluzole's effectiveness for treatment of ischemic stroke. However, the study on Neuroprotective actions of Riluzole shows that Riluzole reduced the prevalence of slow wave and increased the proportion of higher frequency activity seen in the quantified electrocorticogram during cerebral ischaemia. Although both compounds are glutamate release inhibitors, there is no guarantee that Sabeluzole will have similar effects on ischemic stroke.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
