["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"After reviewing the provided documents, we can see that cathepsin L is a thiol proteinase with a molecular weight of 23-24,000 and a pI of 5.8-6.1. It is an endopeptidase that acts at pH 6-7, but does not hydrolyze esters or split synthetic low-molecular substrates to a significant degree. Additionally, it has a pH optimum for digestion of proteins close to 5.0 and is strongly inhibited by leupeptin.\n\nIn the document 'Expression of mouse cathepsin L cDNA in Saccharomyces cerevisiae: evidence that cathepsin L is sorted for targeting to yeast vacuole', we can see that the processed form of cathepsin L was found to be colocalized to the yeast vacuole with the marker enzyme carboxypeptidase Y. Furthermore, phase separation experiments with Triton X-114 provide evidence showing that the mature form of cathepsin L polypeptide is strongly associated with the vacuolar membranes.\n\nGiven these findings, it seems unlikely that cathepsin L would be actively involved in endosomes. Instead, it appears to be targeted for targeting to yeast vacuoles and likely plays a role in intracellular protein degradation.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
