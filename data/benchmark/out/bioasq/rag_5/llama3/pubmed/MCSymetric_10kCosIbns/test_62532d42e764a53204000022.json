["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents describe various studies on the effects of resistance training on muscle hypertrophy. In one study, weight training caused a significant increase in muscle cross-sectional area (CSA) without increasing isometric strength. In another study, concentric isokinetic training resulted in significant hypertrophy and strength gains. A third study found that isometric training increased CSA but not necessarily muscle force-generating capacity. Based on these studies, it appears that resistance training can be associated with increasing muscle hypertrophy.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
