["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents provide information on the effects of curare on various physiological processes. One document suggests that curare blocks the glutaminergic transmission by antagonising the transmitter at the postsynaptic site, indicating a postsynaptic action of curare. Another document shows that curare does not affect the output of acetylcholine (ACh) from motor nerve terminals stimulated at low frequencies. The third document describes the presynaptic action of curare, which strongly interferes with the process of transmitter release and suggests that curare blocks presynaptic depolarizing action of ACh. The fourth document does not provide any information relevant to this question. Finally, the fifth document shows that curare is a specific blocking agent for a class of receptor-activated Na+ and Cl- responses, but it does not mention acetylcholine receptors specifically.\n\nConsidering these findings, it appears that curare primarily acts by blocking the presynaptic release of ACh or antagonising the transmitter at the postsynaptic site, rather than stimulating the acetylcholine receptor. Therefore, the answer is B: no.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
