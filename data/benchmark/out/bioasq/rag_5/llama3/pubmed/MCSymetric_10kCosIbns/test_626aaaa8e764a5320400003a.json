["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks whether epigenetic modifications can be heritable. From the provided documents, we know that epigenetic alterations can cause neoplastic transformation of cells (Genetic nature of neoplastic transformation). We also know that genome imprinting confers functional differences on parental chromosomes as a result of the differences in epigenetic inheritance from parental germlines (Influence of genome imprinting). Additionally, we find that both maternally and paternally inherited methylation patterns are erased in primordial germ cells and distinctive patterns emerge during germ cell maturation (Parental-specific methylation). Therefore, it appears that epigenetic modifications can indeed be heritable.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A: yes\""]
