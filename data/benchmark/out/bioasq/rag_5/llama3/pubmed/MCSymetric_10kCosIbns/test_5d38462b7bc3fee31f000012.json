["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, metformin has been shown to have anti-atherosclerotic effects. In one study, it was found that metformin prevented the development of aortic and coronary lesions in cholesterol-fed rabbits (Comparative effects of metformin and phenformin on the progression and regression of cholesterol induced athreosclerosis in rabbits). Additionally, another study demonstrated that metformin promoted the elimination of arterial lipids and displayed a protective action against coronary atherosclerosis (Comparative effects of metformin and phenformin on the progression and regression of cholesterol induced athreosclerosis in rabbits). Furthermore, electron microscopy revealed homogeneity of particle size and decreased tendency of VLDL to aggregate in the presence of metformin (Metaformin: an antiatherosclerotic agent modifying very low density lipoproteins in rabbits), indicating a potential mechanism by which metformin may alleviate atherosclerosis.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
