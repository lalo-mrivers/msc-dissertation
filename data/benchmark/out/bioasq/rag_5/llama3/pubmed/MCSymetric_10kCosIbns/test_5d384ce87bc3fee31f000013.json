["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about GRHL2 over-expression leading to EMT. The provided documents are about c-erbB-2 oncogene expression in hepatocellular carcinoma and cholangiocarcinoma, qualitative and quantitative evaluation of indirect immunofluorescent H-2 stain on tissue sections, beta 2-microglobulin is selectively associated with H-2 and TL alloantigens on murine lymphoid cells, biochemical characterization of alien H-2 antigens expressed on a methylcholanthrene-induced tumor, and immunoreactivity for c-erbB-2 oncopeptide in benign and malignant diseases of the liver. Since GRHL2 is not mentioned in any of these documents, it's not possible to conclude whether GRHL2 over-expression leads to EMT based on this information.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
