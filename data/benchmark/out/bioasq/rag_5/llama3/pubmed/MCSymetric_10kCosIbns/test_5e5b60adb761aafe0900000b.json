["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the protein ABCG2. After reviewing the provided documents, we can see that none of them mention the protein ABCG2 explicitly. However, one document talks about a new subfamily within the family of ATP binding cassette (ABC)-type transporters called the ABC-2 subfamily. This document does not mention a specific protein ABCG2 either. Another document is about expression of a mouse brain cDNA encoding novel gamma-aminobutyric acid transporter, which is also not related to ABCG2. The third document discusses the human beta 2-adrenergic receptor and its mutations, but again does not mention ABCG2. Finally, the fourth document talks about G-proteins and their bound receptors, which is not relevant to ABCG2 either. Based on this information, we cannot determine whether ABCG2 is transmembrane or not because it is not mentioned in any of these documents.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B: no\""]
