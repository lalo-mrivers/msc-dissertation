["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The provided documents describe various transporters, including glucose transporters, facilitative glucose transporters, Na+/glucose cotransporters, and ABC-type transporters. The document on cloning of a rat kidney cDNA that stimulates dibasic and neutral amino acid transport and has sequence similarity to glucosidases describes the D2 protein, which induces high-affinity, Na(+)-independent uptake of cystine and dibasic and neutral amino acids into cRNA-injected Xenopus oocytes. The document on analysis of Na+-D-glucose cotransporter and other renal brush border proteins in human urine discusses the excretion of different antigens in urine, including the Na+-D-glucose cotransporter. None of these documents mention uric acid transport or excretion.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
