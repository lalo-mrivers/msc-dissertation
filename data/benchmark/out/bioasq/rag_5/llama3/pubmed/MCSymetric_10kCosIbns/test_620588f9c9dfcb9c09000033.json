["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe bergapten as a known phototoxin. In the first document, it is mentioned that bergapten was isolated from samples and its fluorescence was measured using a spectrophotofluorometer. This suggests that bergapten has phototoxic properties. Additionally, in the second document, it is stated that the phototoxicity of bergapten was found to be nearly the same as that of xanthotoxin (8-MOP) in tests on human skin. Furthermore, in the third document, it is mentioned that bergamot oil and its active component, bergapten, induced phototoxic reactions in humans. In the fourth document, it is stated that bergamot oil, which contains bergapten, causes phototoxicity both in guinea pigs and humans. Therefore, it can be concluded that bergapten causes phototoxicity.\", \"answer_choice\": A}"]
