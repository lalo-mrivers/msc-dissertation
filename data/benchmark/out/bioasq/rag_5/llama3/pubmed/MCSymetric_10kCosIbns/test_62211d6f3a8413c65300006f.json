["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the susceptibility of circRNAs to degradation by RNase R. CircRNAs are a type of circular RNA that is resistant to degradation by many ribonucleases due to its unique structure. However, the provided documents do not mention anything specific about RNase R and its effect on circRNAs. Therefore, we need to analyze the properties of RNase R and its mechanism of action to determine its susceptibility towards degrading circRNAs.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
