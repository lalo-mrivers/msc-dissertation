["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to the first document, protamine transcripts were detected only in testicular RNA. This suggests that protamines are specifically expressed in the testis. The second document shows that the genes for protamine 1 and 2 (PRM1 and PRM2) and transition protein 2 (TNP2) are closely linked in the mammalian genome, indicating a specific expression of these genes in certain tissues. The third document describes the characterization of poly(A)+ protamine mRNA components and their translation products, which suggests that there is translational regulation of protamines in different cell-free systems. Finally, the fourth document discusses the molecular characterization of six intermediate proteins in the processing of mouse protamine P2 precursor, which implies a specific expression of protamines during spermiogenesis.\n\nTaking all these points into consideration, it can be inferred that protamines are not ubiquitously expressed.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
