["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to the document 'Isolation and characterization of the methionine aminopeptidase from porcine liver responsible for the co-translational processing of proteins', the enzyme specifically removes methionine residues from peptides with amino-terminal sequences of Met-Ala-, Met-Val-, Met-Ser-, Met-Gly-, and Met-Pro-. This suggests that not all proteins start with methionine. Additionally, the document 'The efficiency of methionine incorporation from isoaccepting species of tRNAMet into rabbit globin in an homologous reticulocyte lysate system' shows that tRNAIMet, also known as initiator tRNA, exhibits very low efficiency for incorporating methionine internally, while other isoacceptors are more efficient. This suggests that methionine is not always the starting amino acid.\", \"answer_choice\": B}"]
