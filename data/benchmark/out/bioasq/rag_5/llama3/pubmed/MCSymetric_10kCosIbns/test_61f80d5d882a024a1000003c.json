["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking whether only changes in coding regions of MEF2C cause developmental disorders. The provided documents are about different genes and proteins, including H-2Df and H-2Dfm2, CF2, human elongation factor 2 (EF-2), and the MCF-2 gene. There is no direct information on MEF2C or its role in causing developmental disorders. Therefore, we cannot determine whether changes only in the coding regions of MEF2C cause developmental disorders based on these documents.\", \"answer_choice\": B}"]
