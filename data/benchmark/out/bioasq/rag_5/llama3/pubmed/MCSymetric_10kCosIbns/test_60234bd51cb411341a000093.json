["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks if ofatumumab is effective for multiple sclerosis. However, the provided documents do not mention ofatumumab. Therefore, we need to look at the treatment options mentioned in the documents. OKT3 (Muromonab-CD3) was used to induce acute severe T-cytopenia and did not show any new clinical or MRI activity of MS during treatment. Antilymphocyte globulin (ALG) combined with dexamethasone was also tried, but it did not seem to change the natural course of the disease. Magnetic stimulation was used to measure motor conduction time (MCT) and showed a significant positive correlation between MCT and motor disability. However, these treatments are not related to ofatumumab, which is an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody. Therefore, based on the provided documents, we cannot conclude that ofatumumab is effective for multiple sclerosis.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
