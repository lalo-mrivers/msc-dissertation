["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks whether cadherin is a plasma membrane marker. The documents mention that classical cadherins are transmembrane glycoproteins which exhibit, in addition to the structural homologies, a very similar overall protein topology. This suggests that cadherins have a portion of their structure embedded in the plasma membrane. Additionally, T-cadherin is attached to the neuronal plasma membrane through a glycosyl phosphatidylinositol anchor, further supporting the idea that cadherins are plasma membrane markers.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
