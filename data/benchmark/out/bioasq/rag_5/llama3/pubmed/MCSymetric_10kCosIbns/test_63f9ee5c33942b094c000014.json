["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about SRRM4 regulating neuronal-specific microexon splicing of TAF1 mRNA. The provided documents discuss various topics such as c-src neuron-specific splicing, su(wa) and tra RNA processing regulators, regulation of alternative pre-mRNA splicing by hnRNP A1 and splicing factor SF2, primary structure of the human splicing factor ASF, and purification of splicing factor SF1. None of these documents directly address SRRM4 regulating neuronal-specific microexon splicing of TAF1 mRNA. Therefore, it is not possible to determine if SRRM4 regulates this process based on the provided information.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B: no\"\n}"]
