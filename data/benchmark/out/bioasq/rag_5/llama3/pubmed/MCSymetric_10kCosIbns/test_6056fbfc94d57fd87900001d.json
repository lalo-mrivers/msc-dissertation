["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Upon examining the provided documents, we can see that there is no direct mention of royal jelly. However, we do have information about egg jelly in Asterina pectinifera and Xenopus laevis, as well as silk secretion in Trichoptera. Since royal jelly is not explicitly mentioned, we will focus on analyzing the chemical composition of these different types of jellies.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe document on Egg Jelly Components responsible for histone degradation and acrosome reaction in Asterina pectinifera mentions that egg jelly induces the degradation of sperm histones as well as the acrosome reaction. However, it does not provide information about the macromolecular composition of the egg jelly.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe document on The Macromolecular Composition of Xenopus laevis Egg Jelly Coat provides detailed information about the chemical composition of the three morphologically and functionally distinct jelly coat layers of Xenopus laevis eggs. According to this document, the carbohydrate in each of the jelly layers consisted of hexosamines, galactose, and fucose, some of which was covalently linked to protein through O-glycosidic bonds.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe document on Studies on Silk Secretion in the Trichoptera (F. Limmephilidae). II. Structure and Amino Acid Composition of the Silk provides information about the structure and amino acid composition of the secreted silk of two species of trichopteran larvae, Pycnopsyche guttifer (Walk.) and Neophylax concinnus McL. However, this document does not provide any information about royal jelly.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe document on Anatomy and Evolution of Proteins Displaying the Viral Capsid Jellyroll Topology provides general information about the anatomy of 25 structures containing a jellyroll motif, but it does not provide any specific information about royal jelly or its chemical composition.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe document on Experimental Studies of the Shape and Structure of Isolated Cardiac Jelly discusses the properties of the early chick embryonic heart cardiac jelly, but it does not provide any information about royal jelly.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn conclusion, while there is no direct evidence that can be used to answer this question, we can say that based on the provided documents, we do not have sufficient information to determine whether royal jelly contains proteins or not.\", \"answer_choice\": A}"]
