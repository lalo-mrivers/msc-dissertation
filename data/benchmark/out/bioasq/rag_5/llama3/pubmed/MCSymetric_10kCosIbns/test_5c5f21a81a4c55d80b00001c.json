["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking whether selenocysteine is an amino acid. We can look at the documents provided to answer this question. The first document talks about the genetic code and how selenocysteine is incorporated into proteins co-translationally using a specific tRNA. This suggests that selenocysteine is indeed an amino acid, as it is being used to build proteins. The second document reviews the discovery of selenocysteine as the 21st amino acid and describes its role in protein biosynthesis. The third document provides details on the biosynthesis of selenocysteine and how it is incorporated into tRNA. This further supports the idea that selenocysteine is an amino acid. Finally, the last document talks about the oxidation of selenocysteine by various enzymes, which also suggests that it is an amino acid.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
