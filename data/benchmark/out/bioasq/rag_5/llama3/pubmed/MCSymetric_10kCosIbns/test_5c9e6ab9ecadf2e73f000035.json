["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents describe the process of maturation of reticulocytes and the formation of exosomes as a mechanism for shedding membrane proteins. The transferrin receptor is one of the surface proteins that disappear from the membranes of reticulocytes as they mature to the erythrocyte stage. This suggests that exosomes can be formed during this process. Additionally, clinical applications of flow cytometry (FACS) include the measurement of cells, cell surface markers, and cell nuclear components for research and clinical laboratory use. FACS is also used for classifying leukemia and lymphomas by measuring cell membrane and cytoplasmic antigens. This implies that FACS can be used to analyze exosomes.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A: yes\"\n}"]
