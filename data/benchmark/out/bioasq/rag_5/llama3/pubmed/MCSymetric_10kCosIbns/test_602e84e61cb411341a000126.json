["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The provided documents discuss interleukin-6 (IL-6) and its receptor system. IL-6 acts on a wide variety of cells, regulating immune response, acute phase reaction, and hematopoiesis. The documents also describe the cloning of cDNAs for IL-6 and its receptor. Monoclonal anti-IL-6 antibodies are obtained to investigate the IL-6/IL-6 receptor system. Type I mAb inhibits IL-6 binding to its receptor completely, while Type II mAb inhibits only partially. Scatchard plot analysis reveals that Type II mAb modulates the binding affinity of IL-6 to its receptor. The documents also describe a two-chain IL-6 receptor system involved in immune and hematopoietic cell regulation. A murine anti-interleukin-6 monoclonal antibody therapy for a patient with plasma cell leukemia is presented, which suggests that blocking/antagonizing the IL-6 receptor can be therapeutic. Therefore, it is inferred that Tocilizumab (Actemra) used to block/antagonize the IL-6 receptor.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
