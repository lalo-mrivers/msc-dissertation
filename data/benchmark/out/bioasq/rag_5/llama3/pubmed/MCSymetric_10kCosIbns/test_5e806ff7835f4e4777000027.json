["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant document is 'The angiotensin I-converting enzyme (kininase II): molecular organization and regulation of its expression in humans.' According to this document, the endothelial ACE displays a high degree of internal homology between two large peptidic domains that each bears a consensus sequence for zinc binding and therefore a putative active site. This suggests that ACE is an enzyme with two active sites. The testicular ACE, however, encoded from the same gene by a shorter mRNA, contains only the carboxyterminal half of endothelial ACE and therefore a single active site. Expression of ACE mutants with only one intact homologous domain indicates that in endothelial ACE both domains are enzymatically active. This implies that ACE is expressed on cell surfaces.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A: yes\""]
