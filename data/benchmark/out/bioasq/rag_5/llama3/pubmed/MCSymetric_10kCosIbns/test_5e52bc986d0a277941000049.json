["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks whether the CADM2 gene is associated with differences in information processing speed. None of the provided documents mention the CADM2 gene or its association with information processing speed. The studies presented focus on memory, comprehension, and hemispheric interaction, but do not specifically investigate the relationship between a particular gene and information processing speed. Therefore, based on the available information, it is impossible to determine whether the CADM2 gene is associated with differences in information processing speed.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
