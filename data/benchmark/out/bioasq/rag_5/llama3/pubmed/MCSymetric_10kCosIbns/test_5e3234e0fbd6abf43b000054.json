["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Radiation-induced meningiomas can be categorized into three groups based on the amount of radiation administered. Since radiosurgery is being considered as a treatment option for these meningiomas, we should look at the previous studies related to radiosensitivity of meningioma and radiosurgery of meningiomas. The study 'Radiosensitivity of meningioma--analysis of five cases of highly vascular meningioma treated by preoperative irradiation' suggests that preoperative irradiation gives little or no beneficial effect on meningiomas other than those of certain types, such as those resembling haemangiopericytomas, or malignant meningiomas. Additionally, the study 'Gamma knife radiosurgery of meningiomas' reports a 96% actuarial 2-year tumor control rate for patients with symptomatic meningiomas treated with stereotactic radiosurgery. Based on these studies, it can be concluded that radiation-induced meningiomas can be treated with radiosurgery.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
