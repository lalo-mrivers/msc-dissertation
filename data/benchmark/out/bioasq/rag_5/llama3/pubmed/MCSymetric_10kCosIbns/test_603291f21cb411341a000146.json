["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks if saponins can be used as adjuvants. In the first document, it is mentioned that a purified saponin (QS-21) acts as an adjuvant for T-independent antigen in mice. This suggests that saponins can be used as adjuvants. Similarly, the second and third documents also suggest that saponins have adjuvant activity. For example, the second document mentions that some saponins are adjuvant-active, and the third document discusses the adjuvanticity of various saponins. Therefore, based on these findings, it can be concluded that saponins can be used as adjuvants.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
