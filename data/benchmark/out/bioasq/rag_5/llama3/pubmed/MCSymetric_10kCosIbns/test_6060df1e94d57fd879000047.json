["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the human genome as containing 100,000 genes, with DNA replication ensuring exact gene copies. The concept of 'junk DNA' is also examined, where it is argued that not all non-coding regions are without function. Sequence organization shows repetitive sequences distributed throughout 80% or more of the genome, with single copy sequences and inverted repeats interspersed. Considering these points, there does not appear to be an inherent limit on functional fraction, as even 'junk DNA' may have some functional role.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
