["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe proteins and enzymes present in honey. The paper on 'Proteins of honey' mentions the separation of amylase-activity from other activities by hydrophobic affinity chromatography on phenyl-butylamine-Sepharose 4B, suggesting that amylase is indeed present in honey. Another study on 'Physical, chemical, and enzymatic studies on the major sucrase of honey bees' describes a sucrase enzyme with alpha-glucosidase activity, which is similar to amylase. Therefore, it can be concluded that honey contains amylases.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
