["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks if genes with monoallelic expression contribute proportionally to genetic diversity in humans. Monoallelic expression refers to the situation where each gene is expressed at one allele per individual. This concept is not directly mentioned in the provided documents, which focus on multigene families, polymorphisms, and population studies. Therefore, we need to analyze the provided texts to determine if they provide any information that can be used to answer this question. The first document discusses Watterson's formulae for the distribution, mean, and variance of the number of alleles in common on two chromosomes with multigene families. This does not directly relate to monoallelic expression or genetic diversity. The second document discusses the displacement of single-locus polymorphisms and how some mutant genes can become replaced over time. While this provides insight into the evolution of gene expression, it does not address the specific question being asked. The third document discusses the prospects for polymorphisms shared between species and the maintenance of these polymorphisms via overdominant and frequency-dependent selection. This does not directly relate to monoallelic expression or genetic diversity. The fourth document discusses unique alleles in admixed populations, but this is also unrelated to the specific question being asked. Finally, the fifth document reviews different mathematical approaches to study the extent of genetic variation of natural populations, including a measure of genic divergence that may be related to gene diversity. However, it does not provide direct information on monoallelic expression or its contribution to genetic diversity. In conclusion, none of the provided documents directly address the question being asked, so we must choose between the two available options.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
