["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to the provided documents, enhancers were found to be gathered in compact groups surrounding operator sites. This empirical rule is true for genes where two conditions were fulfilled: (1) Operator site consists of tandem or inverted repeat of the short oligonucleotide motif, and (2) Multiplication of the operator site leads to increase of enhancer activity because of cooperative interactions between transcription factors. Additionally, an 'enhancer-blocking assay' was used to test putative domain boundaries for boundary function in vivo. This suggests that enhancers may need to be close to their gene targets to function effectively.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
