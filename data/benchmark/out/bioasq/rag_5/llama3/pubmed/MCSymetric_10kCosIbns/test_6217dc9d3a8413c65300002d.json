["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe various aspects of neurofilament protein (NF) subunits and their epitopes. In Parkinson's disease Lewy bodies, epitopes from all three NF subunits are present, including those in the rod and tail domains of NF-L. The study also found that nearly the entire length of each subunit could be demonstrated in Lewy bodies. Additionally, one M-protein (RMO32) recognized a phosphorylated epitope in the tail region of NF-M and immunolabeled nearly all cortical Lewy bodies. These findings suggest that NF proteins are profoundly altered during their incorporation into Lewy bodies.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
