["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"There is no direct mention of MAIT cells in the provided documents. However, we can analyze the immunophenotype of myeloma cells presented in [Recent biological and therapeutic advances in multiple myeloma] which shows a clonal involvement of a stem cell in the pathogenesis of myeloma. This suggests that the disease may be related to B cells or their precursors. Additionally, [Multiple myeloma: an immunologic profile] presents data on peripheral blood lymphocytes in patients with multiple myeloma showing abnormal distribution of B cells and a decrease in SIg-bearing cells. These findings suggest that the disease is primarily related to B cells rather than T cells like MAIT cells.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
