["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about whether the chromatin remodeling complex (RSC) targets H2A.Z nucleosomes. The provided documents do not specifically mention RSC or H2A.Z nucleosomes. However, it can be inferred that histones H2A and H2B are involved in the reassembly of the nucleosome during the reconstitution of chromatin. There is no information about H2A.Z nucleosomes or their interaction with RSC.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
