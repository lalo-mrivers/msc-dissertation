["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The term 'Ixodes' is used as a genus name in several documents. In the first document, 'Illustrated key to the ticks of Italy', it mentions six subgenera and 13 species of Ixodinae within the genus Ixodes. This suggests that Ixodes is a genus, not a species. Similarly, in other documents like [A new species of the Italian tick fauna], [Development of ixodid ticks], and [Ixodid ticks of Barun Glacier region], Ixodes is used as a genus name to refer to various tick species. Therefore, it can be concluded that Ixodes is not a species but rather a genus of ticks.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
