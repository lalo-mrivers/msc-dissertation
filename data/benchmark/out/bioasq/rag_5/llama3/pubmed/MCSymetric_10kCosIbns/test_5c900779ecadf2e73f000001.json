["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"There is no direct information provided about antisense therapy for Huntington's disease. However, we can analyze the given documents to see if they provide any insights. The first document describes the transplantation of cross-species fetal striatal cells into nonhuman primates, which reduced abnormal movements in a primate model of Huntington's disease. This suggests that cell replacement therapy may be a potential approach for treating Huntington's disease. However, there is no mention of antisense therapy. The other documents describe various biological processes and molecular mechanisms, but do not provide any direct information about Huntington's disease or antisense therapy.\n\nTherefore, based on the available information, it is unlikely that antisense therapy would be used to treat Huntington's disease. Instead, researchers may focus on developing cell replacement therapies or exploring other potential treatments.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
