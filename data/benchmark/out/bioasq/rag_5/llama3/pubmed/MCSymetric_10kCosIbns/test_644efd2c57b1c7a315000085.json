["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks whether epigenetic changes change the DNA sequence. The provided documents mention various epigenetic mechanisms such as DNA cytosine methylation, which can affect gene expression without altering the underlying DNA sequence. For example, the document 'An acquired state: epigenetic mechanisms in transcription' states that major aspects of gene expression are governed by epigenetic mechanisms, which may be responsible for apparently identical sequences being read by the transcriptional machinery in two different but heritable ways: active or repressed. Similarly, the documents 'Determination of the role of DNA cytosine methylation in human genetic individuality' and 'Persistence or loss of preimposed methylation patterns and de novo methylation of foreign DNA integrated in transgenic mice' describe experiments where epigenetic changes occur without changing the underlying DNA sequence.\n\nThe document 'Reactivation of a silent Ac following tissue culture is associated with heritable alterations in its methylation pattern' also demonstrates that altered methylation patterns can be inherited through the germ line, again without altering the underlying DNA sequence. Finally, the document 'Revisiting junk DNA' discusses how epigenetic changes can affect gene expression without changing the underlying DNA sequence.\n\nBased on these documents, it is clear that epigenetic changes do not change the DNA sequence.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
