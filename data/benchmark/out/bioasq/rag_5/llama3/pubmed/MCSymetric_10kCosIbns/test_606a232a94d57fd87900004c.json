["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the metabolism of metoprolol in rat liver microsomes and human subjects. The document 'Metabolism of metoprolol in the rat in vitro and in vivo' states that metoprolol was metabolized by O-demethylation with subsequent oxidation, aliphatic hydroxylation of the methoxy-ethyl substituent, and oxidative deamination of the propanolisopropylamine side-chain. There is no specific information on the enzymes involved in these metabolic pathways.\n\nIn the document 'Debrisoquine phenotype and the pharmacokinetics and beta-2 receptor pharmacodynamics of metoprolol and its enantiomers', it is mentioned that the metabolism of racemic metoprolol was investigated, but there is no mention of CYP2D6 specifically.\n\nThe document 'Variation of pharmacokinetics after oral administration of slow-release metoprolol tablets and pharmacogenetic considerations' does not provide information on the enzymes involved in metoprolol metabolism.\n\nThe document 'Electrophysiological properties of intravenous metoprolol in man' does not provide any information on the metabolism of metoprolol.\n\nThe document 'Metoprolol: a review of its pharmacological properties and therapeutic efficacy in hypertension and angina pectoris' provides a general overview of metoprolol's pharmacology, but does not specifically mention CYP2D6 or the enzymes involved in metoprolol metabolism.\n\nTherefore, it cannot be determined from these documents whether metoprolol is metabolized by CYP2D6.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B: no\""]
