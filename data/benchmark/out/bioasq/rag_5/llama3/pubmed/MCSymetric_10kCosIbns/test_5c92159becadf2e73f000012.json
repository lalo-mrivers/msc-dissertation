["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks if tumour-associated macrophages have a prognostic role in gliomas. From the provided documents, it can be seen that tumour-associated macrophages are present in all 15 histologically confirmed malignant glial neoplasms studied (Cytokines and immunoregulatory molecules in malignant glial neoplasms). These macrophages were activated and expressed cytokines such as TNF-alpha and IL-6. Additionally, a study on inflammatory leukocytes associated with increased immunosuppression by glioblastoma found that inflammatory cells within the tumor parenchyma or at the tumor's edge were negative for class II major histocompatibility antigens, suggesting inactivation of these cells. This inactivation may lead to decreased immune response against the tumour. Furthermore, another study on GM-CSF production by glioblastoma cells found that despite the presence of inducing signals GM-CSF is not expressed in vivo, and instead, transforming growth factor-beta 2 mRNA was expressed in ex vivo tested glioblastoma tissues. These findings suggest that tumour-associated macrophages may play a role in immunosuppression and decreased immune response against the tumour.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
