["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"There is no information provided about Daptacel being used instead of IPOL. However, since Daptacel is a brand name for the vaccine diphtheria toxoid and the question asks if it can be used instead of IPOL (which stands for Inactivated Poliovirus Vaccine), I will consider only information related to the pharmacodynamics of daptomycin, as Daptacel is a vaccine made from daptomycin. The provided documents show that daptomycin has potent activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and can be used alone or in combination with gentamicin for ampicillin-resistant Enterococcus faecium. However, there is no information about the use of daptomycin as a vaccine.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
