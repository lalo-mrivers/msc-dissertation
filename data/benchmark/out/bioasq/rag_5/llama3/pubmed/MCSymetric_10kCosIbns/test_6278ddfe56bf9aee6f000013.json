["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking whether functional tests are a good biomarker for Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy. From the provided documents, it seems that there are various functional tests performed such as muscle biopsy, dystrophin detection by immunofluorescence, cardiomyopathy diagnosis using serum enzymes, vector-cardiography, and echo-cardiography, and capillary circulation and morphology studies. The documents also mention spirometry with measurement of vital capacity and forced expiratory volume, and tests of muscle function. However, the study shows that there is no clinically useful relationship between the various non-invasive variables on the one hand and results from skeletal muscle tests or lung function tests on the other, or between the different cardiac investigation methods. This suggests that functional tests may not be a good biomarker for Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy because they do not provide consistent or reliable results.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
