["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Firstly, we need to look at the documents provided. Specifically, 'Virus infections: strategies of prevention' mentions that public health measures can reduce the risk of infection, but virus-specific prophylaxis and active immunization are more effective strategies. Then, we have 'Vaccination against virus diseases' which discusses how vaccination is a crucial strategy in preventing infectious diseases. This includes influenza vaccine, which although not 100% effective, still provides protection. Furthermore, 'Measurements of the prevalence of viral infections' highlights that relatively few viruses cause significant numbers of deaths and that common colds and influenza are major causes of morbidity and impairment. Lastly, we have 'Measures to prevent outbreaks of hospital infections' which discusses the importance of etiological diagnosis, epidemiological investigation, and prophylactic detection of potential sources of infection. None of these documents explicitly mention medications available to prevent COVID-19 following exposure.\", \n\"answer_choice\": \"B: no\"\n}"]
