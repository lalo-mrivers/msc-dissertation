["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"After reviewing the provided documents, I found that HES-5 is a rat basic helix-loop-helix (HLH) factor that has a distant sequence homology to Drosophila hairy and Enhancer-of-split proteins. It binds to the N box sequence and attenuates the binding of E47 to E boxes by forming a hetero-oligomer. HES-5 also represses transcription originating from promoters containing the N box sequences. In contrast, FGF-5 is expressed in the mouse embryo during gastrulation, specifically in the pluripotent embryonic ectoderm just prior to gastrulation. The expression pattern of FGF-5 suggests that it may function in an autocrine manner to stimulate cell mobility or render cells competent to respond to other signals. The hox-1.5 gene is involved in regional development and its disruption leads to a range of developmental defects, including throat abnormalities and craniofacial defects.\n\nBased on these findings, I did not find any information that suggests Groucho related gene 5 (GRG5) has a role only in late development.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
