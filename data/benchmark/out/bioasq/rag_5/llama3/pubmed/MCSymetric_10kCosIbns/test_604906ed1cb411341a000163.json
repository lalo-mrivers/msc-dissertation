["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to the documents, mucins are a family of high molecular weight, highly glycosylated glycoproteins found in various tissues. Increased synthesis of mucin core protein and alterations in the carbohydrates attached to these glycoproteins are believed to play important roles in the function and proliferation of tumour cells. Aberrant glycosylation leads not only to the production of novel carbohydrate structures, but also to the exposure of the core peptide. These novel epitopes may be candidates for diagnosis or therapy. This suggests that mucin overexpression is associated with disease.\",\n\"answer_choice\": A"]
