["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents provide information on labetalol pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics during pregnancy. Since the question asks about Vedolizumab, which is not mentioned in the provided documents, we cannot make a direct conclusion. However, we can look for similarities between the two drugs. Both are medications used to treat specific conditions (labetalol treats hypertension and Vedolizumab treats Inflammatory bowel disease). Labetalol's passage through the placenta and its persistence in amniotic and fetal tracheal fluids is notable. Vedolizumab may have similar pharmacokinetics, but this cannot be confirmed without more information.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B\n}"]
