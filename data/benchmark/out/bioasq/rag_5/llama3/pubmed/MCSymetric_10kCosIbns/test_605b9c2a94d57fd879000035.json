["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents discuss amblyopia, which is a condition that affects vision. In the first document, electroophthalmological investigations show that there are significant differences in pattern reversal VECPs in whole field and lower half field stimulation between amblyopic and healthy eyes. This suggests that amblyopia does affect the eye, specifically the visual centers. The second document mentions amblyogenic factors such as strabismus, refractive errors, or cataracts that can cause amblyopia. The third document discusses deprivation amblyopia, which is caused by vision deprivation and abnormal binocular interaction. This again suggests that amblyopia affects the eye. Finally, the fourth document mentions anisometropic amblyopia, which can be treated with optical correction and occlusion. Overall, it is clear that amblyopia does affect the eye.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
