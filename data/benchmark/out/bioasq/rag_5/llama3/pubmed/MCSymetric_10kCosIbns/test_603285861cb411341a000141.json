["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe multiple receptors for endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide), including CD14 which recognizes lipopolysaccharide with the aid of a serum protein, lipopolysaccharide-binding protein. The documents also discuss the effects of bacterial lipopolysaccharide on cell-mediated immunity and the induction and expression of B-cell subsets responsive to fluorescein-conjugated antigens. Additionally, studies on endotoxin-induced tumor resistance suggest that the mechanism for enhancement of tumor resistance involves B cells and macrophages but not T cells. The regulation of host responsiveness to endotoxin is critical to preserve host defense while avoiding complications such as organ failure and death.\",\n\"answer_choice\": A"]
