["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks if MCL-1 is anti-apoptotic. Based on the provided documents, bcl-2 is mentioned as a protein that prolongs cell survival and blocks apoptosis. This suggests that bcl-2 has anti-apoptotic properties. Since MCL-1 is mentioned to be a member of the cyclin gene family (similar to bcl-1) and its expression inhibits apoptosis, it can be inferred that MCL-1 is also anti-apoptotic.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
