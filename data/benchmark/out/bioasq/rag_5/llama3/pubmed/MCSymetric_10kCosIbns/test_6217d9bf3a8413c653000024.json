["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents provide information on the expression of interferon genes in individual cells in the peritoneum and bone marrow of normal mice. The use of a highly sensitive method of in situ hybridization showed that specific interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha), IFN-beta, or IFN-gamma genes were expressed in cells from the peritoneum and bone marrow. The extent of labeling with either IFN-alpha or IFN-beta-specific probes increased following i.v. inoculation of mice with the IFN-inducer Newcastle disease virus (NDV). No significant differences were observed in the number of bone marrow or peritoneal cells that expressed IFN-alpha or IFN-beta mRNA from either high (C57B1/6) or low (BALB/c) IFN-producing strains of mice.\n\nThe same documents also provide information on the regulation of cell growth and differentiation. The treatment of NIH/3T3 mouse fibroblasts transformed by Moloney-murine sarcoma virus (MSV) with interferon (IFN) resulted in a significant reduction in the rates of cell growth, protein synthesis, and cloning efficiency.\n\nIn the context of the question, it is necessary to consider whether IFNg can induce the expression of IDO. Although the documents do not explicitly state this information, they provide evidence for the involvement of interferon (IFN) system in the regulation of cell growth and differentiation.\n\nFurthermore, the document on induction of the interferon protein in the animal provides general considerations on serum interferon being largely produced by B and T lymphocytes and macrophages, depending on the inducer. This information suggests that IFNg is part of the interferon system.\n\nTherefore, based on the available information, it can be inferred that IFNg may induce the expression of IDO as part of its regulatory role in cell growth and differentiation.\",\n\"answer_choice\": A"]
