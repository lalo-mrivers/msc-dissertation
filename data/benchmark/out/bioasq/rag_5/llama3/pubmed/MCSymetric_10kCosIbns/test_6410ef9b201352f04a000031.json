["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks if modulation of KCNQ1 splicing can prevent arrhythmias. KCNQ1 is a potassium channel gene that codes for the human cardiac K+ channel gene, which controls heart rate and coronary vascular tone and is implicated in the development of arrhythmias. The documents provided discuss the role of potassium channels in cardiac repolarisation and the effects of drugs on this duration. There is no direct mention of KCNQ1 splicing modulation preventing arrhythmias.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B: no\"\n}"]
