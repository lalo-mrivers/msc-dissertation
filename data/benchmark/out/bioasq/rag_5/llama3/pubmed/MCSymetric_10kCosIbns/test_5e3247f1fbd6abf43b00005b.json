["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The case reports presented show instances of osteosarcoma developing after radiotherapy. The paper on 'Radiation-induced human osteogenic sarcoma' states that 8 patients developed radiation osteogenic bone sarcomas an average of 15 years after distant gamma therapy. Another case report mentions postirradiation osteosarcoma in two patients. Additionally, the study on development of osteosarcoma in rats after irradiation shows that malignant proliferation started after at least 180 days of irradiation, indicating that continued radiation can cause tumour development. Therefore, it is likely that radiotherapy can cause radiation-induced osteosarcoma.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
