["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe various techniques and databases related to variant biomacromolecules. The Variant Database is a central repository for data concerning variant molecules. The LBA technique detects chromosome variants, while PCR amplification of specific alleles (PASA) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplify hypervariable genomic sequences. These methods suggest that there are tools available for reviewing variant calls.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
