["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the prognostic role of tumour-associated macrophages in gliomas. Since there are no relevant documents provided that specifically address this topic, I will review the available documents to see if any of them mention anything about macrophages or their role in gliomas. After reviewing the documents, I found that none of them explicitly discuss tumour-associated macrophages and their prognostic role in gliomas. However, one document does discuss chromosomal abnormalities in brain tumors, including gliomas. This might be indirectly related to the topic, as changes in the genome can affect the behavior of immune cells like macrophages. Nevertheless, I will choose an answer based on the information provided.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
