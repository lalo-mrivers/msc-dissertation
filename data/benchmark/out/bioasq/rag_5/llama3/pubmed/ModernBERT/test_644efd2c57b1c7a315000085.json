["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about epigenetic changes and whether they change the DNA sequence. The relevant documents mention DNA cytosine methylation (in [Determination of the role of DNA cytosine methylation in human genetic individuality]) which suggests that epigenetic changes can occur without changing the DNA sequence. This is further supported by the fact that methylation patterns did not change even in DNA from human stomach carcinomas, indicating that epigenetic changes are heritable and do not necessarily alter the underlying DNA sequence.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
