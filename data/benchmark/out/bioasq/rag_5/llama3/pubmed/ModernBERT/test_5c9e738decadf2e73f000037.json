["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"This question is about mitochondria transfer. I will review the provided documents to find any relevant information on mitochondria transfer. None of the provided documents mention mitochondria transfer. Therefore, I will analyze the content of the documents. The first document discusses protein synthesis in bacteria at high pressure and does not mention mitochondria. The second document studies DNA synthesis in chick embryos' nasal placode cells and does not discuss mitochondria either. The third document examines morphine's effect on brain free polysomes and also does not mention mitochondria transfer. The fourth document models the reaction of horizontal cells in fish retina to non-uniform light, which is unrelated to mitochondria transfer. Based on this analysis, I will conclude that there is no information available about mitochondria transfer in these documents.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
