["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"There is no information provided about PRL3-zumab or its effects on cancer cells. The given documents describe various studies on different topics, including cytotoxicity of transferrin-daunorubicin conjugates, cytokine gene expression in tumoral lymph node pathology, immunomodulating activity of ceruloplasmin, and urinary clearance of dl-isopropylnoradrenaline in the dog. One document also discusses a low molecular weight calf pineal peptide that inhibits growth of L1210 and HL60 cells. None of these studies mention PRL3-zumab or its effects on cancer cells. Therefore, we cannot determine if PRL3-zumab can inhibit PRL3+ cancer cells in vitro or in vivo based on the provided information.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
