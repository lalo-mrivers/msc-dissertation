["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about disruption of immune regulation mechanisms and its association with adverse pregnancy outcomes. We can find relevant information from the provided documents. The 'Allergy and pregnancy and birth complications' document suggests that there is a positive relationship between presence of allergic disease and occurrence of pregnancy and birth complications, possibly mediated by underdevelopment of the thymus or impairment of central nervous system mechanisms of immunological response due to anoxia often associated with pregnancy and birth complications. This implies that disruption of immune regulation mechanisms can be linked to adverse pregnancy outcomes. Furthermore, the 'Liver function disorders and blood coagulation disorders in the course of EPH gestosis' document presents cases of EPH-gestosis complicated with liver function and blood coagulation disorders (HELLP syndrome), which may also be related to disruption of immune regulation mechanisms.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
