["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"In this question, we need to determine whether recessive coding variants are responsible for the majority of undiagnosed nonconsanguineous individuals. We have four documents that provide information on inheritance patterns: lipoid proteinosis (autosomal recessive), peculiar type of hypodontia (autosomal recessive), hereditary chorea without dementia (Mendelian dominant), and X-linked mental deficiency megalotestes syndrome (X-linked recessive or autosomal-dominant with male sex limitation). We also have a document on complex segregation analysis of tongue pigmentation, which suggests simple Mendelian inheritance. Based on these documents, we can conclude that recessive coding variants are not always responsible for the majority of undiagnosed nonconsanguineous individuals.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
