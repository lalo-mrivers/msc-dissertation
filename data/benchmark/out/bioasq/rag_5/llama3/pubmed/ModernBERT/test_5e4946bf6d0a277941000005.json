However, the concept of YAC cloning in the first document and Coincident Sequence Cloning (CSC) in the fourth document suggest that genetic mapping and analysis techniques are being discussed. While TADs might be related to these topics, there is no direct evidence provided to support or deny any differences between GRBs and TADs.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
