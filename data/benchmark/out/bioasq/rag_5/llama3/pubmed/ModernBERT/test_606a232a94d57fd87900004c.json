["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about metoprolol's metabolism. None of the provided documents mention metoprolol. However, one document discusses fluoxetine (Lilly 110140) and its inhibition of drug metabolism. Metoprolol has a similar chemical structure to Lilly 110140. Additionally, another document mentions suloctidil (Sulocton), which is also mentioned as having an inhibitory effect on cholesterol biosynthesis in rat liver homogenates. Although this information does not directly relate to metoprolol's metabolism, it suggests that there may be a connection between certain drug metabolisms and the enzymes involved. Unfortunately, none of these documents provide direct evidence about CYP2D6's role in metoprolol's metabolism.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
