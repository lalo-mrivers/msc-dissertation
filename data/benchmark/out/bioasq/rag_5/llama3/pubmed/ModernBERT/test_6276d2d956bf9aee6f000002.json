["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about ACE inhibitors and ARBs increasing the likelihood of severe COVID-19. The provided documents seem to be unrelated to COVID-19 or ACE/ARBs. However, one document mentions angiotensin II inhibitor, which is related to angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE). The document states that angiotensin II inhibitor does not prevent hyperacute rejection, implying that the vasocstriction during hyperacute rejection is not related to high levels of angiotensin II. This information does not suggest any connection between ACE inhibitors and severe COVID-19. Therefore, we can conclude that ACE inhibitors do not increase the likelihood of severe COVID-19.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
