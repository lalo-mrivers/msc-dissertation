["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The provided documents do not directly mention royal jelly or its proteins. However, they discuss various topics such as colicin factors, curare-like polypeptides, collagen, and zonula fibers protein. There is no obvious connection between these topics and royal jelly proteins. Therefore, we must rely on general knowledge to answer the question. Both major royal jelly proteins (MJRP) and yellow proteins are types of proteins found in living organisms. MJRPs are specific to honeybees, while yellow proteins have been identified in various organisms. The key question is whether these two types of proteins share similar characteristics or structures. The document on disc electrophoresis does mention the similarity between collagen and zonula fibers protein. This raises the possibility that different types of proteins may share common structural features or designs, as suggested by Frits Koning's argument about T- and B-cell receptor complexes.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
