["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks if genes with monoallelic expression contribute proportionally to genetic diversity in humans. Monoallelic expression refers to the situation where a gene is expressed from one allele and not the other (imprinting). The provided documents mention genomic imprinting, but do not specifically discuss its contribution to genetic diversity. However, it is mentioned that imprinting plays a role in normal developmental processes and several human pathological conditions. This suggests that genes with monoallelic expression may contribute significantly to genetic diversity, especially in the context of developmental disorders. Therefore, I conclude that the answer is... \",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
