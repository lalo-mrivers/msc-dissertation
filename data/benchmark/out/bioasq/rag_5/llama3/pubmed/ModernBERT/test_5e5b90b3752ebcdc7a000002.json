["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about whether brain-derived exosomes can carry APP molecules. None of the provided documents mention exosomes or APP molecules directly. However, one document discusses proteins and their structures, which could be relevant to understanding protein-protein interactions like those that might occur between brain-derived exosomes and APP molecules. Another document mentions the structure of newly replicated DNA during lens regeneration, which is not directly applicable to this question. The remaining documents discuss cell adhesion molecules, hormone receptors, and species specificity of informatin, all of which are also not directly relevant to understanding whether brain-derived exosomes can carry APP molecules.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
