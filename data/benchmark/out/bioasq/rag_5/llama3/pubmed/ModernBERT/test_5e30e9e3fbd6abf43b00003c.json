["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about Ubrogepant's effectiveness for migraine. None of the provided documents mention Ubrogepant. However, we have some pharmacological information that might be relevant. Propranolol, a beta blocker, is mentioned in one document to reduce intraocular tension and intraocular pressure. This suggests it may have some effect on blood vessels. Pindolol, another beta blocker, is also mentioned as a prophylaxis for arrhythmias during cardiac microcatheterism. Desmopressin (DDAVP) is used to treat enuresis, which indicates its ability to affect urine production. Oestrone's effect on human epidermis suggests it may have some influence on skin and possibly other tissues. Miotically induced vitreoretinal traction is mentioned as the mechanism for macular hole formation following pilocarpine instillation. None of these findings are directly related to Ubrogepant or migraine treatment.\", \"answer_choice\": B}"]
