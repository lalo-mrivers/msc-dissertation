["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Since none of the provided documents discuss ultraconserved enhancers or their relation to normal development, I will need to rely on my general medical knowledge. Ultraconserved elements are genomic regions that have been conserved across long evolutionary distances and often function as regulatory elements. They can play a crucial role in developmental processes. Therefore, based on this general information, I conclude that ultraconserved enhancers are likely important for normal development.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
