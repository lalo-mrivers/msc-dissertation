["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents mention selective methylation as an incorrect hypothesis, which implies that DNA or RNA are not methylated. The document about retinoic acid does not provide information related to methylation. Protein synthesis at high pressure is not related to environmental origin, physiological type, or taxonomic group, and it also doesn't provide information on methylation. Lastly, the 'wobble rules' for codon-anticodon pairing are applicable to RNA composition, but it only provides information about anticodons, not methylation. Therefore, we can conclude that unlike DNA, RNA is not methylated.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B: no\""]
