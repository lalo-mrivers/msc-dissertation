["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking whether it's possible to predict Molecular Recognition Features (MoRFs) regions in Intrinsically Disordered Proteins (IDPs). None of the provided documents discuss MoRFs or IDPs. The documents seem to be unrelated to protein structure prediction or molecular recognition features. Therefore, based on the information provided, it is not possible to computationally predict MoRFs regions in IDPs.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
