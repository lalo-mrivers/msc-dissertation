["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about machine learning-based methods outperforming statistical methods for survival analysis. While the provided documents mention various topics such as system identification, biexponential equations, reduced-rank multivariate regression, and local full likelihood estimation for proportional hazards models, there is no direct information that compares machine learning-based methods with statistical methods for survival analysis. Therefore, we cannot make any conclusions based on these documents.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
