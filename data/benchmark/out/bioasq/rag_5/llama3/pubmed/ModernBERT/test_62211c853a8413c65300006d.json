["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about circular RNA (circRNA) formation. After reviewing the provided documents, I found that they describe various mechanisms of gene expression, such as splicing, transcription initiation sites, and alternative splicing. However, none of these documents explicitly discuss circRNA formation or the sources of its components (exons, introns). Therefore, it is not possible to draw a direct conclusion about whether circRNA is produced by back splicing of exon, intron, or both.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B: no\"\n}"]
