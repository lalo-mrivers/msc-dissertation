["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks if cardenolides inhibit Na+/K+ ATPase. I will analyze the provided documents to find a connection between Na+/K+ ATPase and cardenolides. None of the documents mention cardenolides, but they do discuss different enzymes such as glucose oxidase, N-acetylglucosaminyl-transferases, acetyl-Coenzyme A carboxylase, and mitochondrial H+-ATPase. Since there is no direct connection between Na+/K+ ATPase and cardenolides in the provided documents, I will focus on the characteristics of Na+/K+ ATPase. It is an oligomycin-sensitive ATPase complex with a hydrophobic part consisting of subunits with molecular weights of 30 000, 10 000 and 20 000 + 19 000. Cardenolides are a type of compound that inhibits H+-ATPase in mitochondria. Therefore, cardenolides may also inhibit Na+/K+ ATPase.\",\n\"answer_choice\": A"]
