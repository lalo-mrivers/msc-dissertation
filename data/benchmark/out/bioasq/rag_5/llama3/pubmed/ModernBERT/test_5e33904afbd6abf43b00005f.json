["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents mention radiotherapy treatment for different types of cancers such as Wilms tumor, breast carcinoma, and Hodgkin disease. We can analyze these cases to find if there is a mention of lung cancer being a complication of radiotherapy for Hodgkin disease. In the document 'Breast carcinoma following radiotherapy of metastatic Wilm's tumor', we see that radiation therapy was given to the patient for metastatic Wilms tumor, and 15 years later, she developed breast cancer, suggesting a radiogenic effect. This implies that radiotherapy can cause cancer even after many years. However, there is no specific mention of lung cancer being a complication in this document. The other documents do not provide relevant information either. Therefore, we cannot conclude whether radiotherapy for Hodgkin disease increases the risk of lung cancer.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
