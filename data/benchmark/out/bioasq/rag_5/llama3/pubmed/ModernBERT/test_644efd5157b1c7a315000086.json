["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"While the provided documents don't directly address epigenetic changes, they do discuss genetic recombination, inheritance of traits, and gene transfer. The mention of genotypic modification observed in ageing and carcinogenesis suggests that there can be changes to the underlying genetic makeup. Furthermore, the example of inherited recessive traits in mouse strains implies that these changes can be passed on to subsequent generations. This information collectively supports the idea that epigenetic changes can be heritable.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
