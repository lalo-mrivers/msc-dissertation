["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks if mitochondria can pass through membrane nanotubes. The relevant information is found in the 'Nuclear envelope permeability' document, which states that the nuclear envelope has pores with a patent radius of about 45Ã¥. This does not provide any information about mitochondrial passage. There is no mention of mitochondria or membrane nanotubes in other provided documents. Therefore, it can be concluded that there is no direct evidence to support or refute the idea that mitochondria can pass through membrane nanotubes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
