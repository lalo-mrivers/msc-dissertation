["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"There is no information provided about METTL3 or long noncoding RNAs in the given documents. Therefore, we cannot draw a conclusion about whether METTL3 can methylate long noncoding RNAs. The documents discuss various topics such as chromosome partitioning in E. coli, consensus sequences at transcription start sites, conjugation proteins encoded by the F sex factor, and diversity of coding strategies in influenza viruses. None of these topics are related to RNA methylation or METTL3.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
