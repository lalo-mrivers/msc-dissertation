["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about an upper limit on the functional fraction of the human genome. None of the provided documents mention a specific percentage or upper limit, nor do they discuss the concept of 'functional fraction' in relation to the human genome. The documents cover topics such as the evolution of a universal genetic code, lichen planus and oral cancer, the Y chromosome for studying human evolution, the X chromosome, and trying times for human insulin. None of these topics seem directly related to the question. Therefore, it can be inferred that the question is likely seeking information from outside sources.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
