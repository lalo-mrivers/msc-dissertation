["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about G-quadruplexes (G4) as possible drug targets for glioblastoma. A quick scan of the provided documents reveals that none of them specifically discuss G-quadruplexes or glioblastoma. However, one document (Structure-activity relationship for antitumor thiosemicarbazones) mentions in vitro antitumor activity and another document (Membrane mobility agents. II. Active promoters of cell fusion) discusses membrane mobility agents. Since the question is about G-quadruplexes as drug targets, it's unlikely that the answer can be found in these documents. Therefore, I will look for any connections or references to glioblastoma or G-quadruplexes in the remaining documents (Rapamycin: FK506's fraternal twin or distant cousin? and New developments in instrumentation for vitreous surgery). Unfortunately, none of these documents seem to be relevant to the question. As a result, it appears that the answer is not supported by the provided documents.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
