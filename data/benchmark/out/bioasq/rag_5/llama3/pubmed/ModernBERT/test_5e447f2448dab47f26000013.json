["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The provided documents focus on different topics such as axon guidance, neuroma formation, inhibitory zones, and retinoic acid's role in pattern formation. None of the documents explicitly discuss long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) or their relationship to neuronal outgrowth. However, they do touch on the development of connections in the central nervous system and the regulation of axon outgrowth. Given this information, it is reasonable to conclude that there are no lncRNAs mentioned that control the extent of neuronal outgrowth.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
