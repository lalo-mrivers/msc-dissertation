["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about ultraconserved regions in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. None of the provided documents mention anything about ultraconservation. The first document talks about a rapid nuclear staining method for yeast nuclei, the second about ethidium bromide blocking ascus formation, the third about polyamines and macromolecules in germinating yeast spores, and the fourth is about bacterial characteristics and bacteriophage T4. There is no mention of ultraconserved regions or conservation across different species. Therefore, based on the information provided, it appears that there are no ultraconserved regions in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
