["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the collagen matrix of human articular cartilage. Since the provided documents are related to animal studies (avian lungs, rabbit model for traumatic osteoarthritis, beagle dogs), we need to find a document that specifically addresses the changes in collagen matrix with disease in humans. The document 'Experimental knee instability: early mechanical property changes in articular cartilage in a rabbit model' does not directly address this question as it is an animal study and focuses on biomechanical properties rather than collagen matrix. The other documents are not relevant to human articular cartilage or the effect of disease on collagen matrix. Therefore, we can conclude that there is no direct evidence in the provided documents about the changes in collagen matrix with disease in humans.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
