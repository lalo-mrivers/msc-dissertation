["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking if the glucocorticoid receptor is a transcription factor. Upon reviewing the provided documents, I see that none of them specifically mention the glucocorticoid receptor or its role as a transcription factor.

This suggests that cortisol plays a role in regulating its own release, but it doesn't provide any information about the glucocorticoid receptor's function.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
