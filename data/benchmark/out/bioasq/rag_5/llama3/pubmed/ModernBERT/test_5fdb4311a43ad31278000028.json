["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks if enhancers are directional in their targeting of gene promoters. Enhancers are DNA sequences that can be located far away from the genes they regulate and still exert their regulatory effects. The passage 'Eukaryotic gene regulation: simple vs complex models' discusses the current model of eukaryotic gene regulation, which involves regulatory proteins binding to specific DNA sequences in promoters and interacting with the TATA Box binding factor to increase transcription initiation. However, this passage does not specifically address enhancers or their targeting of gene promoters. Therefore, we cannot determine if enhancers are directional based on this information alone.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
