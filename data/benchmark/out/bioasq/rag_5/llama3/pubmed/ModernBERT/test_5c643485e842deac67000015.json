["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"While there is a review of chromosomal abnormalities in brain tumors, it does not directly imply that de novo mutations in regulatory elements are responsible for neurodevelopmental disorders. Additionally, the provided documents focus on genetic screening for cystic fibrosis and possible genetic consequences of irradiation of tumors in childhood, which do not address the specific question about neurodevelopmental disorders. The document 'Thyrotoxicosis in childhood' mentions a genetic predisposition to an abnormality in immune surveillance, but it is unrelated to neurodevelopmental disorders. Therefore, I will analyze the last document 'Genetic recombination in mammalian somatic cells: a brief note', which discusses genetic modification observed in ageing and carcinogenesis, possibly relevant to the question. Although not explicitly stating de novo mutations in regulatory elements are responsible for neurodevelopmental disorders, it highlights that crossing over in somatic cells is a likely source of genotypic modification observed in ageing and in carcinogenesis, potentially related to neurodevelopmental disorders. Given this analysis, I conclude that...\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
