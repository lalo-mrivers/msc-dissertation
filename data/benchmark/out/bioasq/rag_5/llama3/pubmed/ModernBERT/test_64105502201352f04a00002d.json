["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the reliability of North Star Ambulatory Assessment score for disease progression assessment in Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy. The relevant documents are Fractures of long bones in Duchenne muscular dystrophy and Molecular biological approaches to genetic disorders in prenatal diagnosis. These documents suggest that Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy is a condition characterized by muscle weakness, atrophy, and progressive muscle degeneration. Given this information, it is reasonable to assume that the North Star Ambulatory Assessment score would be an unreliable measure of disease progression in Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy due to its focus on ambulation, which may not accurately reflect the overall extent of muscle degeneration. Furthermore, the assessment score does not account for potential fractures or atrophy of other muscles such as those found in the mandible (as reported in Atrophy of mandibular condyles after sagittal ramus split osteotomy: report of case).\", \"answer_choice\": B}"]
