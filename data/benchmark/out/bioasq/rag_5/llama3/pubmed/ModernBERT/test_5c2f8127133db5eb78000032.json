["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about whole-genome duplications in yeast. None of the provided documents specifically discuss whole-genome duplications or small-scale duplications in yeast. However, yeast artificial chromosomes (YACs) are mentioned in the first document as a tool for cloning large genes and studying complex genomes. This suggests that yeast has been used as a model organism in genetics research. The other documents appear to focus on more general topics such as repetitive DNA amplification, genomic imprinting, mitochondrial genomes, and genetic variation.\", \"answer_choice\": A}"]
