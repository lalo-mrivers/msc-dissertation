["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about advising patients using inhaled glucocorticoids for asthma or COPD to stop these medications to prevent COVID-19. We can look at relevant documents to find information on the use of glucocorticoids and their potential side effects. Document 'Safe use of glucocorticoids' provides guidelines on the use of these potent agents, mentioning adverse effects like Cushing's syndrome and adrenal insufficiency. No specific information is found in this document about COVID-19 prevention. Documents 'Treatment resistant depression in the elderly', 'Drug-induced renal toxicity', 'Fentiazac as a therapeutic aid in the treatment of tuberculosis' do not provide relevant information.
