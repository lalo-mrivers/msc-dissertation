["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The provided documents discuss C3 receptors, T-cell receptor, CD4+, and CD8+. The question asks about the generation and expression of T cells in the thyroid. None of the documents mention the thyroid or T cell generation in this specific organ. However, they do provide information on T cells, their receptors, and subsets (e.g., CD4+ helper T cells). Based on this information, we can conclude that: 1) C3 receptors are present on a subset of T cells, not exclusively on CD8+ or CD4+. 2) The T-cell receptor is expressed by both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Thus, there is no evidence to suggest that CD8+ (cytotoxic) T cells and CD4+ Helper T cells are generated in the thyroid.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
