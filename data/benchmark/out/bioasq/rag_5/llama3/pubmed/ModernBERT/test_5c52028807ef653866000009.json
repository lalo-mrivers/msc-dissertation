["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking whether mitochondria can be inherited by both parents. In the provided documents, we have information on autosomal recessive inheritance (first document), tetralogy of Fallot with a father-son pair (second document), sperm microinjection twins (fourth document), and a family study on recessive Lu(a-b-) phenotype (fifth document). There is no direct information about mitochondrial inheritance. However, we can infer that the documents do not provide evidence suggesting that mitochondria are inherited by both parents. In fact, the fourth document explicitly states that DNA fingerprinting was used to verify paternity and confirm non-identical twins, which implies a nuclear DNA transmission. Therefore, we can safely conclude that mitochondrial inheritance is not mentioned or implied in these documents.\", \"answer_choice\": B}"]
