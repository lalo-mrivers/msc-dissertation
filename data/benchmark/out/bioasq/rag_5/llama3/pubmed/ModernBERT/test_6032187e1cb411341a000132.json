["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about Gram-positive bacteria releasing extracellular vesicles. The provided documents mention different topics such as bacteriophage T4, glucose transport in malarial parasites, bacterial outer membrane secretion systems, and the insertion of colicins into lipid bilayers.
