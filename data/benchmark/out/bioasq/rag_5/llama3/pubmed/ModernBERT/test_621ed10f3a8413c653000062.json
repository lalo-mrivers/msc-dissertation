["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about Tregs (CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cells) being a positive regulator of the immune response. There are no relevant documents that mention Tregs directly. However, one document mentions suppressor T-cells and their involvement in regulating the immune response. This suggests that there may be some connection between Tregs and suppressor T-cells. Further investigation reveals that CD23 has been shown to promote the maturation of normal and leukemic hematopoietic progenitor cells, which could potentially impact the immune response.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
