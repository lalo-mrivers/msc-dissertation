["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC), which are not explicitly mentioned in the provided documents. However, we can relate the information to mesenchymal tumors and embryonic carcinoma cells. The document on Annulate lamellae mentions malignant mesenchymal tumors, which suggests that these tumors have a mesenchymal origin. The document on HMBA's effects on embryonal carcinoma cells shows that some multipotential embryonic carcinoma cells can differentiate into different cell types, implying multipotency. Although MSCs are not directly mentioned, the information on mesenchymal tumors and embryonic carcinoma cells suggests that MSCs might be multipotent.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
