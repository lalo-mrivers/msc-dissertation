["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks if salivary cortisol can be used to evaluate pain in neonates. Let's look at the provided documents. In the first document, plasma cortisol concentration is measured in newborn infants, but it does not mention anything about salivary cortisol or pain evaluation. The second document examines urinary cortisol excretion rates and anxiety in normal 1-year-old infants, which is irrelevant to this question. The third document investigates umbilical cord and neonatal cortisol levels, and the fourth document examines the metabolism of cortisol by term baboon neonates. None of these documents provide information about salivary cortisol or its relation to pain evaluation in neonates. Therefore, based on the provided information, it appears that salivary cortisol cannot be used to evaluate pain in neonates.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
