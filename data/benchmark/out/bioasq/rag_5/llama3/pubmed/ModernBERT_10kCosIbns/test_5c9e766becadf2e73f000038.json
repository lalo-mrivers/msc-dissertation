["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about whether mitochondria can pass through membrane nanotubes. Mitochondria are often found in close proximity to each other, with extensive contact sites between the mitochondrial membranes. However, the permeability of the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM) has been studied and shown to have voltage-gated conductances that could potentially restrict free permeability of mitochondrial substrates. Additionally, there is evidence of high-conductance pathways in mitochondrial membranes that are still not fully understood. Considering these findings, it's possible that mitochondria may not be able to pass through membrane nanotubes freely.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
