["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents mention protamine genes in different species such as human, boar, bull, mouse, and rat. The presence of protamine mRNA components is also described in the poly(A)+ protamine mRNA: partial purification and characterization of a heterogeneous family of polyadenylated messenger components document. Additionally, the translation of partially purified poly(A)+ protamine messenger RNA components in wheat germ and rabbit reticulocyte cell-free systems evidence suggests that all four protamine mRNAs can be translated into protamines. Furthermore, the presence of protamine kinase in different species such as bovine kidney microsomes is also mentioned. These findings collectively suggest that protamines are ubiquitously expressed.\",\n\"answer_choice\": A"]
