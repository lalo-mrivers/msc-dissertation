["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks if astrocytes are part of the blood brain barrier. The relevant documents describe the properties of astrocytes, their electrophysiological characteristics, and their ion channels. None of these documents explicitly state that astrocytes are part of the blood brain barrier. However, one document discusses the membrane potential of primary cultures of astrocytes from DBA, C57, and SW mice, which may be related to the blood brain barrier. Another document describes mechanotransducing ion channels in astrocytes, which could be relevant to the blood brain barrier. Overall, it seems that astrocytes are not directly part of the blood brain barrier, but their properties and ion channels may play a role in its functioning.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
