["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about bergapten's ability to cross the blood-brain barrier. In the study 'A determination of bergapten in fragrance preparations by thin layer chromatography and spectrophotofluorometry', it was found that bergapten is a known phototoxin. There is no information provided on its ability to cross the blood-brain barrier specifically, but we do know that bergapten has phototoxic properties similar to xanthotoxin (8-MOP) in tests on human skin. This suggests that bergapten may be able to penetrate tissues or membranes, but there is no conclusive evidence that it can cross the blood-brain barrier. The other studies provided do not provide any relevant information to answer this question.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
