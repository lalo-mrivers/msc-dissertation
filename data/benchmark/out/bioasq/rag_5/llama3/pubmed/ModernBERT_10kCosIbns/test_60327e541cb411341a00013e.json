["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks whether Hunter's disease is associated with the X chromosome. We have documents that talk about Hunter syndrome being an X-linked disorder caused by deficiency of the lysosomal exohydrolase iduronate-2-sulphatase (IDS). The IDS gene was localised to Xq28, and one-third of Hunter syndrome patients had various deletions or rearrangements of their IDS gene. Additionally, carrier detection was performed using a non-isotopic in situ hybridization method that mapped the Hunter gene to the terminal region of the human X chromosome, close to the Xq28 band. These findings strongly suggest that Hunter's disease is associated with the X chromosome.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
