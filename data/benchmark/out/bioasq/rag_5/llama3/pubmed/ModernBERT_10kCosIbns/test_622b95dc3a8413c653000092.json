["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents mention retinol-binding protein (RBP) and cellular retinol-binding protein (CRBP). The studies suggest that RBP is expressed almost exclusively in adipocytes, while CRBP is found in stromal-vascular cells. The function of RBP is to bind to retinol and facilitate its transport into cells. In the context of the question, an adipokine is a hormone produced by adipose tissue. Given the expression of RBP in adipocytes, it can be inferred that RBP is indeed an adipokine.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
