["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about MVA85A's ability to confer immunity against smallpox. None of the provided documents mention smallpox or MVA85A. However, one document talks about OM-85 BV and its effect on recurrent airway infections, which does not relate to smallpox. Another document discusses hepatitis A vaccination, but it doesn't provide any information relevant to smallpox. The third document is about measles vaccination, and the last one explores the relationship between an 85 kDa protein and protective effects of Mycoplasma pneumoniae.
