["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks whether whole-genome duplications are more divergent than small-scale duplications in yeast. We can analyze this by looking at the repetitive DNA sequences mentioned in the documents. Specifically, we can look at the Ty1 and delta families of repeated sequences. According to the documents, these sequences show some sequence divergence between repeat units. This suggests that even within a single family of repeats, there is some degree of divergence. Therefore, it seems likely that whole-genome duplications would also show some degree of divergence.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
