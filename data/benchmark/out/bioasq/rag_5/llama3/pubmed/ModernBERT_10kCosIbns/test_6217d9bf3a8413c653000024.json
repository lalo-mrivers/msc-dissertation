["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Interferon-gamma (IFNg) is a type of interferon that can modulate growth in a variety of tissues. According to the document [Function, molecular structure and gene expression of interferons], IFNg binds to its specific receptor and has different characteristics from other types of IFN. The document does not provide direct information on whether IFNg induces the expression of IDO (indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase). However, it is mentioned that IFNs can modulate important developmental and injury-related events in tissues such as the pancreas and CNS. This suggests that IFNg may be involved in regulating cellular processes, including those related to IDO expression. Therefore, based on this information, I will choose an answer.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A: yes\"\n}"]
