["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"None of the provided documents explicitly state whether promoter shape varies across populations. However, one document discusses regulatory mutations and human genetic disease, mentioning that mutations in gene promoter/regulatory regions can cause human genetic disease. This suggests that there may be some variation in promoter sequence or structure between individuals. Another document presents a study on promoter traps in embryonic stem cells, which selects for integration of DNA into CpG islands. This study does not address the question of whether promoter shape varies across populations. The remaining documents discuss specific promoters and their effects on gene expression, without providing information about population-level variation.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
