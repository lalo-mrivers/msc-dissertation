["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, we know that Bcl-2 is a protein that inhibits apoptosis. It is localized to mitochondria and extends cell survival by blocking programmed cell death. We also know that Bcl-2 is overexpressed in transgenic mice and leads to prolonged immune responses and extended cell survival. These findings suggest that Bcl-2 has an anti-apoptotic effect, which is consistent with its role as a regulator of programmed cell death.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
