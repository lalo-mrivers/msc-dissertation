["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking if protein ALEX1 contains armadillo repeats. The relevant documents are the ones about armadillo gene (arm) and alpha-actinin gene (atn-1). Since there is no mention of ALEX1 in these documents, we need to look at other documents for information about this protein. Unfortunately, none of the provided documents contain any information about ALEX1. Therefore, we cannot determine whether protein ALEX1 contains armadillo repeats or not.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B: no\"\n}"]
