["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about METTL3 methylating long noncoding RNAs. The provided documents describe tRNA methylases, but there's no specific information about METTL3 or its ability to methylate long noncoding RNAs. However, the text does provide some insights into how tRNA methylases work and what they can do. For example, it shows that some tRNA methylases can recognize tertiary structure of tRNAs and can also be inhibited by certain tRNA molecules. Based on this information, we can deduce that METTL3 might not have the same mechanism of action as these tRNA methylases since it is supposed to methylate long noncoding RNAs. Therefore, our answer should take into account the possibility that METTL3's mechanism might be different from what is described in the provided documents.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
