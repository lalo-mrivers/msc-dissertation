["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about ultraconserved enhancers and their importance for normal development. Ultraconserved enhancers are not mentioned directly in the provided documents, but the discussion on gene repression and activation during embryogenesis suggests that gene regulation plays a crucial role in development. The 'fetal' or 'oncodevelopmental' antigens present in tumor cells may also be relevant to this question, as they are related to gene activation. However, there is no specific information about ultraconserved enhancers in the provided documents.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
