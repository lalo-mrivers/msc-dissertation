["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking if Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) are multipotent cells. According to the provided documents, MSCs can divide and their progeny become committed to a specific and distinctive phenotypic pathway, a lineage with discrete steps and, finally, end-stage cells involved with fabrication of a unique tissue type, e.g., cartilage or bone. This process is controlled by local cuing (extrinsic factors) and the genomic potential (intrinsic factors). There is no mention of MSCs having the ability to differentiate into multiple cell types, which suggests that they may not be multipotent cells.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
