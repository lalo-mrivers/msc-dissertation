["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents discuss T cells and their roles in autoimmune thyroid disease. According to the texts, human T cells recognize self and foreign antigens when such antigens are processed into small peptides and bound to molecules coded for by genes of the HLA region on chromosome 6. The study mentions that in patients with Graves' disease, mainly helper T-cell clones have been obtained, whereas in autoimmune (Hashimoto's) thyroiditis cytolytic T-cell clones may be predominant. It is also mentioned that there are compelling evidence that the thyroid cell itself, by expressing HLA molecules, and presenting antigen directly to the T cells, may initiate disease, perhaps after an external insult.\n\nAdditionally, the study on cloned T cells has shown that CD8+ murine T cell clones and cloned murine CD4+ TH1 and TH2 T cells reactive with nominal antigen (ovalbumin) lysed nucleated target cells bearing antigen or coated with anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody in a short-term 51Cr-release assay. This suggests that both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells have lytic capabilities.\n\nFurthermore, the study on characterization of a CD4-positive T-cell line derived from an athymic (nu/nu) mouse shows that these cells recognize a common determinant on class II MHC antigens and can be triggered to proliferate and secrete lymphokines in the presence of irradiated syngeneic or allogeneic splenic feeder cells that express a variety of MHC haplotypes.\n\nThe study on differentiation of an immature T cell line: a model of thymic positive selection shows that the ability of immature T cells to recognize MHC molecules in the absence of foreign antigen in the thymus can be attributed to a unique property of thymic antigen-presenting cells.\n\nFinally, the study on Type 1 T helper and type 2 T helper cells: functions, regulation and role in protection and disease shows that most allergen- or helminthic antigen-specific CD4+ human T cell clones have a TH2 phenotype, whereas the majority of T-cell clones specific for mycobacterial antigens or antigens responsible for type IV hypersensitivity exhibit a TH1 phenotype.\n\nFrom these studies, it can be concluded that both CD8+ and CD4+ T cells are generated in the thyroid and express the T-cell receptor.\",\n\"answer_choice\": A"]
