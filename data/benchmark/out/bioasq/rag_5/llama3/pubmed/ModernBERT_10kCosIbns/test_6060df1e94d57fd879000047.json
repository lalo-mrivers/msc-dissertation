["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking if there is an upper limit on the functional fraction of the human genome. The Human Genome project states that genes provide the blueprint for the amino acid sequence of structural protein or functional protein. This suggests that a significant portion of the genome may be functional. However, the compositional properties of human genes suggest that GC levels in exons are higher than those in intergenic sequences and introns. This implies that there may not be an upper limit on the functional fraction of the human genome. The workshop overview does not provide direct information relevant to this question.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
