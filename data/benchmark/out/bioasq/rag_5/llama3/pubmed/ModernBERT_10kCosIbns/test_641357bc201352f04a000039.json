["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about cells undergoing necroptosis, which is not directly related to the provided documents. However, one of the documents talks about tissue-culture cell fractionation and membrane disruption. Specifically, it mentions that polyoma-virus-transformed baby-hamster kidney cells failed to be disrupted adequately under certain conditions. This suggests that some types of cells may require additional steps for complete cell breakage. Another document discusses the ultrastructure of human neoplastic cell culture, which includes information on surface topography and internal organization. None of these documents explicitly mention necroptosis or membrane disruption in this context. Based on this analysis, we can infer that the question is not directly addressed by the provided documents.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
