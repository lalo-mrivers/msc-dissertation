["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents provided describe membrane vesicles from Escherichia coli (a Gram-negative bacterium).

Therefore, it cannot be concluded whether Gram-positive bacteria are able to release extracellular vesicles based on these documents.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B: no\"\n}"]
