["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks if whole genome sequencing can be used for diagnosis of mitochondrial disease. Mitochondrial DNA is a small, double-stranded, circular DNA molecule that is exclusively maternally transmitted (Neurological disease and mitochondrial genes). It encodes polypeptides involved in electron transport and shows a maternal inheritance pattern (Mitochondrial DNA and genetic disease). The mode and mechanism of mitochondrial DNA replication and transcription are reviewed in Structure and function of the mitochondrial genome. This information suggests that changes in mitochondrial DNA sequence can have consequences, but it does not directly address whole genome sequencing for diagnosis. Strategies for automated sequencing of human mitochondrial DNA directly from PCR products (Strategies for automated sequencing of human mitochondrial DNA directly from PCR products) imply that specific techniques are necessary for amplification and sequencing of mitochondrial DNA. Mitochondrial disease is caused by major deletions and point mutations of mitochondrial DNA, as well as nuclear genes that affect mtDNA (Mitochondrial disease and mitochondrial DNA). Whole genome sequencing would encompass both nuclear and mitochondrial DNA sequences, but the question specifically asks about whole genome sequencing for diagnosis of mitochondrial disease.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A: yes\"\n}"]
