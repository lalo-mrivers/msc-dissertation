["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks whether alternative splicing is associated with heart disease. To answer this, we need to look for relevant information from the provided documents. None of the documents explicitly mention a connection between alternative splicing and heart disease. However, one document discusses the effects of point mutations on mRNA splicing, which can lead to changes in gene expression that may be related to heart disease. Another document describes the features of splice sites and how they affect the accuracy of mRNA splicing. This information is relevant because it provides context for understanding how alternative splicing might contribute to heart disease. Based on this analysis, I conclude that... \",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
