["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents discuss the pathophysiology of migraine, the pharmacology of antimigraine drugs, and the mechanism of action of drugs used for prophylactic treatment. There is no mention of CGRPs (calcitonin gene-related peptides) in these documents. Therefore, I will focus on finding information related to small molecule therapies for migraine treatment. The documents do not explicitly discuss this topic either. However, they do mention various classes of drugs used for antimigraine therapy, including ergot alkaloids, 5-HT1-like receptor agonists, beta-adrenoceptor antagonists, calcium antagonists, and anti-inflammatory agents. This suggests that researchers have been exploring different pharmacological approaches to treat migraine.\n\nBased on this information, I will conclude that there is no direct evidence supporting the development of small molecule CGRPs for the treatment of migraine.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B: no\"\n}"]
