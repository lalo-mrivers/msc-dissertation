["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The provided documents describe the expression of the fibroblast growth factor-5 (FGF-5) gene during embryogenesis in mice. The results show that FGF-5 RNA is detected at seven distinct sites in the developing mouse embryo, including postimplantation epiblast, lateral splanchnic mesoderm, and myotomes. There is no mention of Groucho related gene 5 (GRG5) in these documents. Therefore, we cannot conclude that GRG5 has a role only in late development based on the provided information.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
