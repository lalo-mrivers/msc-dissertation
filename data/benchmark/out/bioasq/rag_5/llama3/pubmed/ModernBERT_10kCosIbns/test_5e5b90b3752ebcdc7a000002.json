["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"After reviewing the provided documents, I noticed that none of them directly mention brain-derived exosomes or APP molecules being transported together. However, one document discusses the degradation of amyloid precursor protein (APP) in lysosomes. This suggests that APP can be processed and degraded in certain cellular compartments. Another document describes the formation of vesicles containing lipids and proteins, which could potentially include exosomes. Given this information, it is unclear whether brain-derived exosomes specifically carry APP molecules or not.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
