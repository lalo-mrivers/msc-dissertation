["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"After reviewing the provided documents, I found that none of them mention royal jelly or antimicrobial proteins in royal jelly. However, one document discusses egg jelly components responsible for histone degradation and acrosome reaction in starfish, which is different from royal jelly. Another document talks about antigenic peculiarities and properties of stable L-forms of Salmonella, but it does not relate to royal jelly either. The remaining documents discuss different topics such as sterol compositions of oceanic jellyfish, isolation methods for various bacteria, or the use of colistin-polymyxin B-cellobiose agar for isolating Vibrio vulnificus. Therefore, I can confidently conclude that there is no information in these documents about antimicrobial proteins in royal jelly.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
