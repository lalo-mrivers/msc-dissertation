["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"ADP-ribosylation is a post-translational modification (PTM) because it involves the covalent attachment of ADP-ribose to proteins. This process changes the chemical properties and structure of the protein, which can affect its function. The documents describe various aspects of ADP-ribosylation, including purification methods, characterization of ADP-ribosylated proteins, and the effects of phospholipid and GTP on recombinant ADP-ribosylation factors (ARFs). These findings support the conclusion that ADP-ribosylation is a PTM.\", \"answer_choice\": A}"]
