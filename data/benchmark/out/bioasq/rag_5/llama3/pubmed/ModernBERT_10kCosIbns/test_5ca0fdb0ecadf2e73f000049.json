["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The first document describes an experiment where nuclei from 35S-labeled amoebas were transplanted into unlabeled cells. The actin within the nucleus was found to be about 2/3 pelletable, whereas in the cytoplasmic actin only about 1/3 is pelletable. This suggests that polymerized actin is present in the nucleus. Additionally, the last document describes the evolution rate of actins and mentions their unique tightly fitted structure rich in biologically active centres at short distances from each other, which makes it likely to have actin in the nucleus.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
