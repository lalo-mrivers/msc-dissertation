["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The first document discusses the biochemical adaptation of human skeletal muscle to heavy resistance training and immobilization. It highlights significant increases in muscle creatine, CP, ATP, and glycogen concentrations after 5 months of heavy resistance training. This suggests that resistance training is associated with increasing muscle energy reserves.\n\nThe second document investigates adaptations in skeletal muscle following strength training. Although it does not directly address hypertrophy, it demonstrates changes in fiber composition and enzyme activities. The lack of correlation between these changes and gains in peak torque or fatigability may imply that hypertrophy can occur independently of increased isometric strength.\n\nThe third document discusses the effect of passive exercise training on muscle activity, strength, and lean body mass. It shows no significant changes in muscle strength or lean body mass after six weeks of training, suggesting that resistance training may not necessarily result in hypertrophy.\n\nThe fourth document examines the influence of eccentric actions on skeletal muscle adaptations to resistance training. The findings indicate that training with both concentric and eccentric actions leads to greater increases in Type I area and capillarization compared to using only concentric actions.\n\nConsidering these documents, it appears that resistance training can lead to increased muscle hypertrophy.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
