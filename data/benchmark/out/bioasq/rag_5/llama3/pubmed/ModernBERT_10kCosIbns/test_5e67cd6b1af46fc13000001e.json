["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about whether AZD3759 crosses the blood brain barrier. To answer this, we need to look for information about CD59's characteristics and functions. From the provided documents, we know that CD59 is a GPI-linked glycoprotein that acts as an inhibitor of the membrane attack complex of autologous complement. It is also involved in antigen presentation and downregulation of membrane attack complex. CD59 is broadly distributed on cells of various organs, including erythrocytes, lymphocytes, monocytes, and platelets.\n\nWe don't have any direct information about AZD3759's crossing the blood brain barrier. However, we can try to make an educated guess based on what we know about CD59. Since CD59 is a GPI-linked glycoprotein that acts as an inhibitor of the membrane attack complex, it might be expected to behave similarly to other GPI-linked proteins.\n\nOne study (Regulatory control of the terminal complement proteins at the surface of human endothelial cells: neutralization of a C5b-9 inhibitor by antibody to CD59) suggests that CD59 is anchored to the cells via a glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol (GPI) link, which means it could potentially be transported across the blood brain barrier.\n\nAnother study (Gene structure of human CD59 and demonstration that discrete mRNAs are generated by alternative polyadenylation) shows that CD59 is encoded by a single gene residing on chromosome 11. This information doesn't directly relate to the question about AZD3759, but it might be useful if we were trying to identify the mechanisms behind CD59's function.\n\nIn conclusion, based on what we know about CD59 and its characteristics, it is possible that AZD3759 could cross the blood brain barrier due to its GPI-linked structure. However, this is purely speculative and more research would be needed to confirm or refute this hypothesis.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
