["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks if the rotavirus vaccines have changed the predominant rotavirus genotypes. To answer this question, we need to look at the available documents. The first document discusses the development of a rotavirus vaccine in Venezuela and the different approaches taken. However, it does not specifically mention changes in the predominant genotypes. The second document is about the epidemiology of human rotaviruses Types 1 and 2, but again, it does not provide information on changes to the predominant genotypes. The third document discusses the use of bovine rotavirus as a source of antigen for a vaccine, but this is not relevant to the question. The fourth document describes active protection against rotavirus infection in mice following intraperitoneal immunization, which is also not relevant to the question. Therefore, we cannot find any information that suggests the vaccines have changed the predominant genotypes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
