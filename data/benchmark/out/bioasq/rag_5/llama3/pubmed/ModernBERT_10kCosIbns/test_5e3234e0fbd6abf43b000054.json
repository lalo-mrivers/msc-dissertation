["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe radiation-induced meningiomas as a distinct category of meningiomas. The papers discuss the use of radiosurgery for treating meningiomas, including radiation-induced ones.

There is no explicit statement against using radiosurgery for radiation-induced meningiomas. Therefore, it can be inferred that yes, radiation-induced meningiomas can be treated with radiosurgery.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
