["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking if neurofilament light (hNF-L) is a marker for disease. The provided documents do not explicitly mention hNF-L as a marker for disease.

There is no evidence presented that suggests hNF-L is associated with disease.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
