["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the metabolism of arachidonic acid (AA) by cytochrome P-450 monooxygenase system. Specifically, AA is metabolized to epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) and omega/omega-1 hydroxylases through epoxygenation and omega/omega-1 hydroxylation reactions. The renal cortex, particularly the proximal tubule, demonstrates high concentrations of cytochrome P-450 enzyme activities involved in AA metabolism. This suggests that EETs are synthesized by cytochrome P-450 epoxygenases from arachidonic acid.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
