["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking if Eflornithine and Sulindac are effective for prevention of progression in Familial Adenomatous Polyposis. In the provided documents, we see that Eflornithine was used to treat Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia and Trypanosoma brucei gambiense sleeping sickness, as well as desmoid tumors in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis. The results suggest that Eflornithine may be useful as an alternative therapeutic agent for Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, but there is no specific mention of its effectiveness in preventing progression in Familial Adenomatous Polyposis.\n\nOn the other hand, Sulindac was used to treat intra-abdominal desmoid tumors in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis and showed significant benefits in reduction of desmoid size and improvement of symptoms. This suggests that Sulindac may be effective for prevention of progression in Familial Adenomatous Polyposis.\n\nHowever, there is no direct evidence comparing the effectiveness of Eflornithine and Sulindac in preventing progression in Familial Adenomatous Polyposis.\", \n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
