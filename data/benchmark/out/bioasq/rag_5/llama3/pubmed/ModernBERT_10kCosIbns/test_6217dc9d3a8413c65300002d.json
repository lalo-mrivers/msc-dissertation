["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks whether NfL (neurofilament light chain) is a biomarker of neurodegeneration. To answer this, we need to look at the relevant documents provided. The first document talks about epitope maps and Lewy bodies, but it doesn't mention NfL specifically. The second document discusses transcriptional control of the neurofilament light gene (NF-L), which is the same as NfL. This suggests that NF-L is involved in the regulation of its own expression. The third document describes two mRNA species for the human neurofilament light gene, including one that is specific to neurons. This implies that NF-L may have a role in neuron-specific functions. The fourth document shows immunofluorescence studies of neurofilaments in rat and human peripheral and central nervous systems, which suggests that NfL is expressed in neurons and myelinated axons. Finally, the fifth document discusses expression of human mid-sized neurofilament subunit (which includes NfL) in transgenic mice, showing that it is abundantly expressed in CNS and PNS but also present at low levels in some non-neural tissues.\",\n\"answer_choice\": A"]
