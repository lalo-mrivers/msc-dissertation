["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks if Selinexor is effective for multiple myeloma. After reviewing the provided documents, I found that there are no mentions of Selinexor in any of them. However, one document discusses treatment of melphalan-resistant multiple myeloma with vincristine, BCNU, doxorubicin, and high-dose dexamethasone (VBAD). This suggests that treatment options for multiple myeloma include combination chemotherapy and melphalan-based regimens, but there is no mention of Selinexor. Therefore, I cannot conclude that Selinexor is effective or ineffective based on the provided documents.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B: no\"\n}"]
