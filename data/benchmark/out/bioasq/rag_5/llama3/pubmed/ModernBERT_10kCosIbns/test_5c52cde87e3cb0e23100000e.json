["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks whether allele phasing improves the phylogenetic utility of ultraconserved elements. The provided documents discuss various topics such as population size estimation, infinite allele model with varying mutation rate, study of variation in human genome, and estimating allele frequencies of hypervariable DNA systems. None of these documents specifically address allele phasing or ultraconserved elements. Therefore, it can be concluded that there is no relevant information provided to answer this question.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
