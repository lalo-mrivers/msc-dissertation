["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The provided documents discuss epigenetic mechanisms that affect gene expression. Epigenetic transcriptional states are mentioned as being responsible for heritable changes in the way genes are read by the transcriptional machinery. Additionally, the document on 'Evolutionary consequences of nonrandom damage and repair of chromatin domains' mentions how the decondensed chromatin structure, torsional strain on the DNA, and absence of nucleosomes from regulatory regions can affect rates of damage to individual genes. This suggests that epigenetic changes, such as those affecting introns, can influence gene expression. Therefore, it is likely that the epigenetic status of introns can affect gene expression.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
