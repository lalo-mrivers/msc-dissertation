["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks whether modulation of KCNQ1 splicing can prevent arrhythmias. In the provided documents, there is a mention of KCNA1 gene which codes for a potassium channel and is localized to the distal short arm of human chromosome 12. However, this document does not mention anything about KCNQ1 or its splicing modulation. Therefore, we cannot conclude that modulation of KCNQ1 splicing can prevent arrhythmias based on the provided information.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
