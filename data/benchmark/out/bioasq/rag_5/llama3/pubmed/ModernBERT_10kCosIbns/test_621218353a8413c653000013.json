["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about REGN5458, which is not mentioned in the provided documents. However, we can analyze the properties of chimeric antibodies like ING-1 and ING-2 to draw some conclusions. Both ING-1 and ING-2 bind to specific antigens on human breast carcinoma cell lines. They also have different biological activities such as ADCC and CDC. Since REGN5458 is not mentioned, we can't determine its target specificity. However, based on the characteristics of chimeric antibodies, it's likely that REGN5458 may be a single-targeted antibody.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B: no\""]
