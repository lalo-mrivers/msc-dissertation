["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking whether atenolol is metabolized by CYP2D6. Upon reviewing the provided documents, we can see that there are multiple references to metabolism and metabolic pathways of atenolol. However, none of these documents specifically mention CYP2D6 as a relevant enzyme in the metabolism process. In fact, document 5 mentions a minor metabolite arising from hydroxylation at the methylene carbon of the carbamoylmethyl group, but it does not specify which enzyme is responsible for this reaction.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
