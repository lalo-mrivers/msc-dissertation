["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking if poliosis circumscripta refers to a white or unpigmented patch of hair or skin. Based on the provided documents, we can see that black piedra is a superficial mycosis of the hair shaft and causes nodules on the hair shaft. White piedra is caused by a fungus Cepholosporium acremonium and also results in nodules on the hair shaft. Neither of these conditions involves white or unpigmented patches of hair or skin, so it's unlikely that poliosis circumscripta refers to this condition. Therefore, based on the information provided, I would say that poliosis circumscripta is not another term for a white or unpigmented patch of hair or skin.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
