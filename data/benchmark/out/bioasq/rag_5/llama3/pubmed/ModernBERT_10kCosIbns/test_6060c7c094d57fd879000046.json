["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Cadherins are cell-surface receptors involved in specific cell adhesion during development. They mediate adhesion through an interaction between the cadherin cytoplasmic domain and intracellular proteins, called catenins. This suggests that cadherins can be found on the surface of cells, making them plasma membrane markers.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
