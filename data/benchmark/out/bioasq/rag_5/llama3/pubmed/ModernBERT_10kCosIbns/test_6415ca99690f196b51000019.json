["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents describe the use of bispecific antibodies (bsAbs) to target T cells towards B cell tumors. In one study, a bsAb was developed that recognized both the idiotype of a mouse B cell lymphoma and the CD3 complex on T cells. This antibody induced T cell proliferation, IL-2 secretion, and redirected lysis of the relevant target cells. In vivo studies showed that this bsAb could efficiently target T cells towards tumor cells, resulting in long-term survival and cure of the lymphoma. This suggests that CAR-T cell therapies, which are a type of bsAb-based therapy, have been approved for the treatment of B cell malignancies.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
