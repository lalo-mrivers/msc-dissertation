["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the NLM medical text indexer (MTI) and whether it's still useful and relevant. The documents provided are research papers related to natural language processing and indexing for biomedical information. Upon reviewing the documents, I found no direct mention of the MTI or its current status. However, the papers do discuss various approaches to automated indexing and parsing of medical text, including the use of semantic nets, clinical thesauri, and UMLS knowledge sources. Given that these approaches are still being developed and improved, it's likely that the MTI may not be as relevant in today's context.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
