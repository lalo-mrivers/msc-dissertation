["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about dacarbacine (DTIC) which is a topic discussed in the provided documents. The documents mention DTIC as a treatment for various types of cancer, including malignant melanoma, soft tissue sarcomas, Hodgkin's disease, gastrointestinal carcinomas, and oat cell cancer of the lung. However, there is no information about glioblastoma specifically.\n\nThe first document discusses DTIC as a single agent or in combination with other cytotoxic agents, but does not mention glioblastoma.\n\nThe second document compares the treatment of metastatic malignant melanoma with DTIC alone versus DTIC plus tamoxifen. It does not discuss glioblastoma.\n\nThe third document presents a study on high-dose cisplatin with DTIC and tamoxifen in patients with metastatic melanoma, but again does not mention glioblastoma.\n\nThe fourth document is about acecainide (N-acetylprocainamide) which has no relevance to the question of using DTIC for treatment of glioblastoma patients.\n\nSince there are no relevant data on DTIC as a treatment for glioblastoma, it is unclear whether it should be used for this indication. However, based on the available information, DTIC does not seem to have been studied or recommended for treating glioblastoma.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
