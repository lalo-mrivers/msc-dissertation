["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided, phospholipid hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidase is a selenoenzyme distinct from classical glutathione peroxidase. This suggests that it is a selenoprotein homologous to classical glutathione peroxidase, but poorly related to it. The primary structure of PHGPx was partially elucidated by sequencing peptides obtained by cyanogen bromide cleavage and tryptic digestion and by isolating and sequencing corresponding cDNA fragments covering about 75% of the total sequence. This information indicates that PHGPx is a selenoprotein.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
