["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks whether all proteins start with methionine. The provided documents discuss the aminoacylation of transfer ribonucleic acid (tRNA) with methionine and the recognition mechanism of Escherichia coli methionyl-tRNA synthetase. There is no direct evidence suggesting that all proteins start with methionine. In fact, one document states that a methionine aminopeptidase removes methionine residues from peptides with amino-terminal sequences, implying that not all proteins start with methionine.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
