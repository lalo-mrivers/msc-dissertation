["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking if Impetigo is a viral infection that affects the skin. We can look at the provided documents to answer this question. In the first document, 'Epidemiological aspects of impetigo contagiosa in western Sweden', it states that Staphylococcus aureus was the only organism isolated in 72.5%, beta-hemolytic streptococci, group A, in 10%, and both pathogens in 15%. This suggests that Impetigo may not be caused by a viral infection. In the other documents, there is no mention of a viral cause for Impetigo. Therefore, based on the information provided, it seems unlikely that Impetigo is a viral infection.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B\n}"]
