["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe labetalol, a combined alpha-1 and beta adrenergic blocker. The study 'Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of labetalol in the pregnant sheep' discusses the maternal-fetal disposition of labetalol and its effects on the mother and fetus. In this study, it is observed that labetalol rapidly crosses the sheep placenta and persists in the amniotic and fetal tracheal fluids up to 24 hours. The peak fetal plasma concentration was 33.7 +/- 5.8 ng/ml. No significant maternal or fetal cardiovascular effects were observed, but some metabolic effects, including fetal and maternal lactic acidosis and hyperglycemia, were noted. This information suggests that labetalol can be detected in the fetus and breast milk of nursing mothers.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B: no\""]
