["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to the provided documents, epigenetic modifications can be influenced by the differences in epigenetic inheritance from parental germlines. It appears that imprinting of some parental alleles is critical for their dosage, affecting embryonic growth, cell proliferation and differentiation. The influence of modifier genes can also be affected by their parental origin, perhaps partly by the maternally inherited oocyte cytoplasmic factors. This suggests that epigenetic modifications can be heritable.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
