["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks if metoprolol is metabolized by CYP2D6. The relevant documents mention the metabolism of metoprolol in rat liver microsomes in vitro and in vivo. It states that metoprolol was metabolized by O-demethylation with subsequent oxidation, aliphatic hydroxylation of the methoxy-ethyl substituent, and oxidative deamination of the propanolisopropylamine side-chain. The same routes of metabolism were revealed from urinary metabolites. No specific mention is made of CYP2D6 being involved in metoprolol metabolism.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
