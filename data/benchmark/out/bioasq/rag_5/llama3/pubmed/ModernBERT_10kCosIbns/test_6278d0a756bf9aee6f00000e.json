["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The provided documents describe various interactions of p85 subunit with different proteins or peptides. There is no direct evidence suggesting the homodimerization of p85Î±. However, one document mentions the presence of two SH2 domains in p85, designated SH2-N and SH2-C, which bind to different regions of the PDGF receptor. This suggests that p85 might have multiple binding sites or interactions with other proteins.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
