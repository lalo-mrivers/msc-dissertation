["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to the provided documents, collagen biosynthesis involves a number of unique post-translational modifications which are catalyzed by many specific enzymes. The main steps in collagen biosynthesis are transcription and translation, hydroxylations of prolyl and lysyl residues, glycosylations of hydroxylysyl residues, chain association and disulphide bonding, triple helix formation, secretion of procollagen into the extracellular matrix, conversion of procollagen into collagen, specific aggregation of collagen molecules and crosslink formation. There is no direct information about the abundance of collagen in human proteins.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B: no\"\n}"]
