["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to the documents provided, Protoporphyrinogen oxidase is mentioned as being localized to the intermembrane space of mitochondria. The study on mitochondrial localization of coproporphyrinogen III oxidase found that the enzyme was situated in the intermembrane space with a fraction loosely bound to the inner membrane. Additionally, the study on the uptake of porphyrin by isolated rat liver mitochondria mentions that deuteroporphyrin taken up in parallel to the transmembrane potassium gradient is accessible to ferrochelatase, which suggests that protoporphyrinogen oxidase is localized to the mitochondrium.\",\n\"answer_choice\": A"]
