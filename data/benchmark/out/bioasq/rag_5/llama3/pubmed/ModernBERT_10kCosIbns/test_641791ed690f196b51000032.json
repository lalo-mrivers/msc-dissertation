["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about SARS-CoV-2 transmission through breast milk. The provided documents discuss the transmission of HIV-1 through breast milk, bovid herpesvirus 2 (BHV2) in experimentally infected calves, and mechanisms of transport of environmental pollutants and ingested drugs in breast milk. Since SARS-CoV-2 is not mentioned in any of these documents, we cannot find direct evidence supporting or refuting the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 through breast milk. However, considering that HIV-1 and BHV2 are both retroviruses and share some similarities with SARS-CoV-2, it can be inferred that the mechanisms of virus transmission may not be significantly different for these viruses.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B: no\"\n}"]
