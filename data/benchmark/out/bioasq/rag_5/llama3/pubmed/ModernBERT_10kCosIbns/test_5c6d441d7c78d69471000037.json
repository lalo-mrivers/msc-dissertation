["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about Eucommia ulmoides leaf extract ameliorating steatosis/fatty liver induced by high-fat diet. The relevant documents are about the effects of different edible oils on monoxygenases in liver, nutritional and metabolic studies of distillable fractions from fresh and thermally oxidized corn oil and olive oil, cytotoxic effect of fatty acids in vitro on Ehrlich exudative carcinoma cells and normal exudative cells (leukocytes), physiopathological effects of feeding heated oils to rats, and the effect of dietary fat saturation on acylcoenzyme A:cholesterol acyltransferase activity of Ehrlich cell microsomes. These studies suggest that heating or oxidation of oils can cause changes in fatty acid composition, liver damage, and alterations in detoxification mechanisms. The study does not provide any information about Eucommia ulmoides leaf extract.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B: no\"\n}"]
