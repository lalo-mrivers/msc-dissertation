["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking if GRG5 (DRG) is involved only in late embryonic mouse development. We can look at the relevant documents to answer this question.\\nFrom 'Expression of DRG during murine embryonic development', we know that drg mRNA expression is strongly detected in various embryonic tissues and then greatly reduced in newborn animals.\\nThis suggests that GRG5 (DRG) may play a role in early embryonic development, not just late embryonic mouse development.\\nIn 'mRNA localization studies suggest that murine FGF-5 plays a role in gastrulation', we see that Fgf-5 expression increases dramatically in the pluripotent embryonic ectoderm just prior to gastrulation. This indicates that GRG5 (DRG) may be involved in earlier stages of embryonic development.\\nFinally, 'Spatiotemporal patterns of expression of NGF and the low-affinity NGF receptor in rat embryos suggest functional roles in tissue morphogenesis and myogenesis' does not mention GRG5 (DRG), but it provides context about the developmental stages at which other genes are expressed.\\nConsidering these points, we can conclude that GRG5 (DRG) is not only involved in late embryonic mouse development.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
