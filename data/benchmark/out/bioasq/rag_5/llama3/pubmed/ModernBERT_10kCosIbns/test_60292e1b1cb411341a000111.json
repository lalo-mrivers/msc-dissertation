["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks whether Curare functions by stimulating the acetylcholine receptor. In 'The effect of curare on the release of acetylcholine from mammalian motor nerve terminals and an estimate of quantum content', it is stated that 'Curarized and non-curarized rat hemidiaphragm muscles were indirectly stimulated in vitro.' The authors then eluted the fluid bathing the active curarized muscles, separating ACh from Curare. They found that the amount of ACh released by curarized muscles was not significantly different from that released by non-curarized muscles. This suggests that Curare does not affect the output of ACh from motor nerve terminals stimulated at low frequencies. Therefore, it is unlikely that Curare functions by stimulating the acetylcholine receptor.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
