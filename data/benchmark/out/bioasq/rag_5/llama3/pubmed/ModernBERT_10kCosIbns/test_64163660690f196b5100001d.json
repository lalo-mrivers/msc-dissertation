["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents discuss the use of deflazacort (DF) as an alternative to prednisone/prednisolone for treating various conditions. In the first study, DF was found to be effective in improving muscle strength and reducing side effects compared to prednisone. The other studies also demonstrate that DF has fewer side effects than prednisone while still being equally effective or more so in some cases. Therefore, it can be concluded that deflazacort is at least as efficient as, if not more efficient than, prednisone/prednisolone for the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
