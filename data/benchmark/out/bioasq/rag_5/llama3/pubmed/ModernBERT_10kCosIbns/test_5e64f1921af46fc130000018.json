Field trials have been conducted in Venezuela using different strategies such as simian rotavirus (RRV-ser 3), reassortant viruses with serotypes 1, 2 and 4, and a virus isolated from a newborn child. The studies showed that these vaccines induced homotypic protection and were innocuous but required further evaluation for immunogenicity and efficacy. The documents also discuss the importance of developing a vaccine that provides resistance to both human rotavirus Types 1 and 2. A study on active protection against rotavirus infection in mice demonstrated the effectiveness of parenteral immunization.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
