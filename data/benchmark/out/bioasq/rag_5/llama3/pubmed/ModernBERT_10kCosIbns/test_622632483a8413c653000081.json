["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking if disruption of immune regulation mechanisms is associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes including preeclampsia (PE). Looking at the provided documents, we see that there are studies and findings related to immune responses in pregnancy, particularly in preeclampsia. The studies suggest that toxemic women may be relatively hyporesponsive to certain stimuli, and there is an immunosuppressive effect of autologous cord serum observed in preeclamptic pregnancies. Additionally, serum seromucoid levels are elevated in the toxemic women during and after the index pregnancy. These findings collectively support the idea that disruption of immune regulation mechanisms may be associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes including preeclampsia.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
