["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking if Huntington's disease is caused by expansion of a CTG repeat in the HTT gene on Chromosome 4. We need to look for information that suggests this cause. Linkage disequilibrium and recombination make a telomeric site for the HD gene unlikely, which implies that the gene is not located at the very end of chromosome 4. The recombination event mapped within a 50 kilobase region about 700 kb from the 4p telomere further supports this notion. Additionally, the analysis of linkage disequilibrium in Scottish families showed significant non-random association between the HD gene and alleles at the D4S95 and D4S98 loci, which does not point to a specific location or mechanism for the disease. The article also mentions that no detectable rearrangements involving chromosome 4p16.3 have been observed in patients with Huntington's disease. Overall, these findings do not provide direct evidence for the expansion of a CTG repeat in the HTT gene on Chromosome 4 as the cause of Huntington's disease.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
