["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks if BCL11B is involved in schizophrenia. The relevant documents mention chromosome 11, but they don't specifically mention BCL11B. However, one of the studies examines the linkage between schizophrenia and markers on chromosome 11 in two Japanese pedigrees.

Therefore, based on the provided information, it's unlikely that BCL11B is involved in schizophrenia.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
