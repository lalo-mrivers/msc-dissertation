["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks whether genes with monoallelic expression contribute proportionally to genetic diversity in humans. Monoallelic expression refers to the expression of a gene from one allele only, whereas biallelic expression refers to the expression of a gene from both alleles. The provided documents do not explicitly discuss genes with monoallelic expression and their contribution to genetic diversity. However, we can make some inferences based on the information available. Comparative mapping suggests that there is conservation of autosomal synteny groups between humans and other species, which implies that many genes are expressed biallellically. The infinite allele model with varying mutation rate also supports this idea, as it describes the distribution of allele frequencies and heterozygosity in a population. Therefore, we can assume that most genes contribute to genetic diversity through their expression from both alleles. Genes with monoallelic expression might exist, but there is no information available on their prevalence or contribution to genetic diversity.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
