["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks if Lysozyme is abundant in human tears. We can look at the provided documents to find the answer. In 'A spectrophotometric method for quantitative determination of lysozyme in human tears', it says that the level of lysozyme in tears of 60 healthy people was determined by this method and found to be 6.1 mg per milliliter hen egg lysozyme (HEL) with standard deviation of 1.57 mg per milliliter HEL or 1.5 mg per milliliter human tear lysozyme (HTL) with standard deviation of 0.39 HTL. This suggests that Lysozyme is present in human tears, but we don't have information about its abundance.\",\n\"answer_choice\": A"]
