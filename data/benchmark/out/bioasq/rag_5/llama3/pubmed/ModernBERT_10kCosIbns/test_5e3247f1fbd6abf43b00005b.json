["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the relationship between high-dose radiotherapy and osteosarcoma. The first document states that high-dose radiotherapy has a significant survival effect compared to early amputation therapy for patients with osteosarcoma, which suggests a possible link between radiation and osteosarcoma development. The second document presents a case report of postirradiation osteosarcoma in a patient who underwent surgery and received adjuvant postoperative radiotherapy 11 years prior. This supports the idea that radiation can induce osteosarcoma. Additionally, the third document discusses the use of hypofractionated accelerated radiotherapy for palliative treatment of osteogenic sarcoma and notes that this method produced severe damages to normal tissues in a high proportion of patients, which could potentially lead to the development of radiation-induced osteosarcoma. The fourth document presents two case reports of postirradiation osteosarcoma after radiation therapy for metastatic skeletal lesions, further supporting the idea that radiotherapy can induce osteosarcoma.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
