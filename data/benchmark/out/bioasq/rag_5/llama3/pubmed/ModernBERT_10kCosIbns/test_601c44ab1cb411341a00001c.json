["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is whether radiosurgery can be used for DNET tumors. The relevant documents mention the treatment of malignant brain tumors, including glioblastomas, but do not specifically mention DNET tumors. However, the document on dose-volume considerations in radiosurgery mentions that most solitary metastases, ependymomas, well-circumscribed (on imaging studies) AAs, and a few glioblastomas have responded dramatically to radiosurgery. This suggests that radiosurgery may be effective for treating certain types of brain tumors, including those with histological characteristics similar to DNET.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
