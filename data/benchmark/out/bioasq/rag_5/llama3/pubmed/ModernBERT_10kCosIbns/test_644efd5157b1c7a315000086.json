["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking whether epigenetic changes are heritable. The provided documents discuss genome imprinting, co-recessive inheritance, and the relationship between spontaneous mutation rates in vivo and in vitro. According to the 'Influence of genome imprinting on gene expression, phenotypic variations and development' document, epigenetic modifications of parental alleles probably occur progressively and this will affect their potential for expression. Additionally, the 'On the relationship between spontaneous mutation rates in vivo and in vitro' document suggests that germinal tissue is sequestered from mutagenic insult or subjected to selection against mutational damage so as to keep the genetic load of a species at a tolerable level. This implies that epigenetic changes are heritable, but may be influenced by various factors such as parental origin and oocyte cytoplasmic factors.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
