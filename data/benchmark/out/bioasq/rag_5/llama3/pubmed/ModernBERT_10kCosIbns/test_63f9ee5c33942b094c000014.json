["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"There is no direct evidence linking SRRM4 to neuronal-specific microexon splicing of TAF1 mRNA. The question seems unrelated to the provided documents. The documents describe RNA-dependent ATPase activity in splicing factor PRP16 and regulation of muscle regulatory factor MRF4 during somite and skeletal myofiber development. They do not mention SRRM4 or neuronal-specific microexon splicing of TAF1 mRNA.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B: no\"\n}"]
