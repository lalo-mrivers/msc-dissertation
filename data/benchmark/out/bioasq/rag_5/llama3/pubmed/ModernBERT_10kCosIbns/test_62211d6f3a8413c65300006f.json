["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about whether circular RNAs (circRNAs) can be degraded by RNase R. We need to look for information on the specificity of RNase R and its interaction with RNA structures. According to the provided documents, we can infer that RNase R is not specifically mentioned as an enzyme used in any of the described methods or studies. Therefore, we cannot conclude whether circRNAs are susceptible to degradation by RNase R based on the provided information.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
