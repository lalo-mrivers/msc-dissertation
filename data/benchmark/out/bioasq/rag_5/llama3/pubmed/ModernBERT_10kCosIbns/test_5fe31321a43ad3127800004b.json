["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks if yeast FBP1 is affected by glucose starvation stress. We can look at the relevant documents to see if there is any information about FBP1 or fructose-biphosphatase (FBP). In the document 'Effects of glucose and nitrogen source on the levels of proteinases, peptidases, and proteinase inhibitors in yeast', it mentions that fructose-biphosphatase is inactivated after the addition of glucose to derepressed cells. This suggests that FBP1 might be affected by glucose. However, there is no specific information about the effect of glucose starvation stress on FBP1.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
