["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The provided documents discuss pre-mRNA splicing signals, cooperation of sequence elements in splice site selection, combinatorial splicing of exon pairs by two-site binding of U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particle, and control of alternative splicing by the differential binding of U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particle. The documents do not specifically mention microexon alternative splicing of small GTPase regulators or their implication in central nervous system diseases.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
