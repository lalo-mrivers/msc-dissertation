["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents suggest that deletion at 6q24-27 is associated with serous ovarian tumors. There is a high incidence of allelic loss on chromosome 6q in ovarian carcinoma, and frequent losses were observed between loci defined by CI6-119 (D6S195) at 6q26 and CI6-49 (D6S161) at 6q27. This suggests that deletion at 6q24-26 may be associated with poor survival.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
