["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents provide information on chemically modified and recombinant hemoglobin blood substitutes. There is a mention of using human blood as a starting material for the production of HbXL99 alpha, which is heat stable and can be used to perfuse the heart during coronary angioplasty. This suggests that hemoglobin may have antimicrobial properties, as it is described as having viral inactivation capabilities. Additionally, the document on the expression of recombinant human hemoglobin does not mention any adverse effects or interactions with infectious agents. The documents on chemicals reacting with various forms of hemoglobin do not specifically discuss the antimicrobial properties of hemoglobin.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
