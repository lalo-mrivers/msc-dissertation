["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"There is no mention of ABCG2 protein in the provided documents. However, we can learn about the structure of ABC-type transporters from the document 'A new subfamily of bacterial ABC-type transport systems'. The document states that for three systems comprising this subfamily (Drr, Nod, and Kps) only one integral membrane constituent has been identified, whereas for the other two systems (Bex and Ctr) two dissimilar integral membrane constituents have been found. This suggests that the transmembrane channels of ABC-2-type transporters can be formed of homo- or heterooligomers. Based on this information, it is likely that the protein ABCG2 is a transmembrane protein.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
