["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"After reviewing the provided documents, I found that there is no direct information about synonymous sites in primates and rodents. The first document discusses the tempo and mode of evolution revealed from molecular phylogenies. The second document presents procedures for multiple alignment of sequence data and testing of trees derived from molecular data. The third document discusses self-similarity in biological classifications, including power law distributions of supraspecific taxa. The fourth document proposes a hypothesis about species-ecological twins and their role in accelerating evolution.\n\nGiven the absence of direct information on synonymous sites, I will focus on general principles from the provided documents. Phylogenetic reconstruction (second document) and self-similarity in biological classifications (third document) suggest that evolutionary processes shape phylogenetic trees. These processes include speciation and extinction.\n\nConsidering these principles, it is reasonable to assume that synonymous sites in primates and rodents are not necessarily functionally constrained. This assumption is supported by the fact that sets of conserved sequence-tagged sites (STSs) from human DNA can be used to assemble maps for other primates and some based on gene sequences are useful for mouse and rat as well (first document). This suggests that genetic information can be shared across species, potentially allowing for functional constraints to vary between them.\n\nBased on these arguments, I conclude that synonymous sites in primates and rodents are not functionally constrained.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B: no\""]
