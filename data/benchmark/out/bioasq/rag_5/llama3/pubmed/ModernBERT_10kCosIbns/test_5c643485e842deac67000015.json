["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about de novo mutations in regulatory elements being responsible for neurodevelopmental disorders. The provided documents talk about gene disruption, endogenous mutations, insertional mutagenesis, and methylation. Since the question specifically mentions regulatory elements, we need to look at the mechanisms of insertional mutagenesis and how they relate to regulatory elements. According to 'Mechanisms of insertional mutagenesis in human genes causing genetic disease', insertions can occur due to slipped mispairing mediated by direct repeats or runs of identical bases, templated misincorporation of bases by secondary-structure intermediates, and palindromic sequences. This suggests that regulatory elements could be affected by these mechanisms, leading to de novo mutations. Therefore, it is possible that de novo mutations in regulatory elements are responsible for neurodevelopmental disorders.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
