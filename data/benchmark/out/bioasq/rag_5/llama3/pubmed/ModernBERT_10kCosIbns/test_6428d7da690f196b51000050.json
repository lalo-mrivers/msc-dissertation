["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents provide information about transcriptional regulation, protein-protein interactions, and RNA localization. The document 'Determinants of mRNA localization' specifically discusses the role of untranslated regions (UTRs) in mRNA targeting. This suggests that UTRs can regulate gene expression by providing a mechanism for protein targeting within cells.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
