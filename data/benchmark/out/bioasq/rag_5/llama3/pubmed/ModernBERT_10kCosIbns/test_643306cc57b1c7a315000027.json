["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking if CRISPR/Cas12a can be used for the detection of EGFR mutations in circulating DNA. The provided documents discuss PCR, SSCP, and chemical cleavage methodologies, but they do not specifically mention CRISPR/Cas12a. The documents do discuss the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and its potential role in pancreatic cancer, as well as PCR-based methods for detecting EGFR mutations. However, there is no direct evidence that CRISPR/Cas12a can be used for this purpose.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
