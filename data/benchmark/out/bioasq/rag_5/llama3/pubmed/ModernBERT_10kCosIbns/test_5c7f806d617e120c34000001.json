["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents discuss tumor-specific antigens, which are mutant proteins encoded by oncogenes or suppressor genes that have undergone structural mutations. These mutations result from point mutations, chromosomal translocations, internal deletions and viral insertional mutagenesis; several of these changes result in fusion proteins. The papers do not specifically mention whether the tumor-specific antigens originate from known protein coding genes or not. However, it is mentioned that a single malignant cell can express multiple independent antigenic target sites, which may allow a multi-pronged immune attack.\", \"answer_choice\": A}"]
