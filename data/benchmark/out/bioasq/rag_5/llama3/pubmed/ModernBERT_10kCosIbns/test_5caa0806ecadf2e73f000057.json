["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about Apelin levels in diabetes. Since the provided documents don't mention Apelin explicitly, we need to look for information related to met-enkephalin (met-ENK) and beta-endorphin (beta-END). Plasma met-ENK levels were found to be significantly higher in type I diabetic patients than in healthy women before and after a standard meal. This suggests that met-ENK might not be decreased in diabetes, but rather increased. No information is provided about Apelin or its relationship to diabetes.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
