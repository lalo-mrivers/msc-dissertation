["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks if there are lncRNAs (long non-coding RNAs) that control the extent of neuronal outgrowth. The provided documents focus on the development and characterization of neuronal cell lines from rat and mouse brain, as well as studies on nuclear proteins and gene expression in neuronal precursor cells. None of these studies specifically address long non-coding RNAs or their role in controlling neuronal outgrowth. Therefore, it is not possible to conclude whether lncRNAs control the extent of neuronal outgrowth based on the provided information.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
