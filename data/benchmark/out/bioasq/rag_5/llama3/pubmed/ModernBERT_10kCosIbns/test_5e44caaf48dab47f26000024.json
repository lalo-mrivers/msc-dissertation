["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Sabeluzole is a compound studied for its cerebral effects, particularly in models of ischemia. It has shown increased survival time in hypobaric hypoxia, anoxic hypoxia, and decapitation model. Additionally, it has counteracted the hypoxia-induced decrease of fast-wave amplitudes during cortical resistance period and slow-wave and increase of fast wave amplitudes during cortical recovery period in asphyxic hypoxia in cats. There is no direct evidence that Lubeluzole should be used for treatment of ischemic stroke, but based on its similar structure to Sabeluzole, it may have potential benefits.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A: yes\""]
