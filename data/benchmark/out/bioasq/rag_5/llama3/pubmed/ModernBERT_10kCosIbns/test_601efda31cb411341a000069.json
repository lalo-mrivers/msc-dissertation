["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe bleomycin's ability to induce lung toxicity through various mechanisms. Morphological and functional modifications can be seen in type II pneumocytes after 48 hours of acute treatment, which might be the earliest stage of pulmonary damage. Dose-dependent changes in lung collagen content and histopathological parameters are also observed. Additionally, studies show that bleomycin causes interstitial oedema with an influx of inflammatory and immune cells, leading to the development of pulmonary fibrosis. The documents do not provide evidence that bleomycin does not cause lung toxicity.\", \"answer_choice\": A}"]
