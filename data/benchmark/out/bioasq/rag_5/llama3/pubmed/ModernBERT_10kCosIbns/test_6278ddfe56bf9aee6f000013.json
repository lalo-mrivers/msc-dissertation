["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking if functional tests are a good biomarker for Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy. Functional tests refer to the electrocardiography (ECG), vector-cardiography, and echo-cardiography mentioned in [Cardiomyopathy in Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Part 2: serum enzymes, vector-cardiography, and echo-cardiography in 143 patients (author's transl)]. The documents also discuss the pathokinesiology of Duchenne muscular dystrophy and its clinical progression as described in [Walter J. Zeiter Lecture: pathokinesiology of Duchenne muscular dystrophy: implications for management]. The sequential changes of orthogonal electrocardiograms in progressive muscular dystrophy of the Duchenne type, presented in [Sequential changes of orthogonal electrocardiograms in progressive muscular dystrophy of the Duchenne type], show a reduction in R wave amplitude and an abnormal Q wave with advancing severity. This suggests that functional tests can be used to assess cardiac involvement and estimate the extent of disease progression.\",\n\"answer_choice\": A"]
