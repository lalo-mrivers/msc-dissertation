["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about lucatumumab binding to CD140. Lucatumumab is not mentioned in the provided documents. However, one of the documents describes a protein called GMP-140, which is an inducible receptor for myeloid leukocytes on activated platelets and endothelium. This protein recognizes specific oligosaccharide ligands. The document also mentions that GMP-140 recognizes alpha(2-3)sialylated, alpha(1-3)fucosylated lactosaminoglycans on both myeloid and nonmyeloid cells. CD140 is not mentioned in the documents. However, based on the description of GMP-140, it seems that GMP-140 recognizes a specific oligosaccharide sequence, whereas CD140 is not specified.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B: no\"\n}"]
