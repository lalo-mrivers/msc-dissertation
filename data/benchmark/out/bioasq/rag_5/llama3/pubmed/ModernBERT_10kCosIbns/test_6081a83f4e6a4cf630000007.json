["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"FKBP52 is an immunophilin that associates with the 90-kDa heat shock protein (hsp90) in untransformed mammalian steroid receptor complexes. The putative immunosuppressant-binding site is probably distinct from the hsp90-binding site, and we predict that FKBP52 has different structural domains to accommodate these functions. This suggests that FKBP52 may have chaperone-like properties.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
