["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking if the 22-item sino-nasal outcome test (SNOT-22) is a widely used measure for Health-Related Quality-of-Life (HRQOL) associated with chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS). None of the provided documents explicitly mention SNOT-22 or HRQOL. However, functional endoscopic sinus surgery in the management of chronic rhinosinusitis mentions various tests such as visual analogue scoring, nasomucociliary function by ciliary beat frequency, olfaction by qualitative olfactometry and nasal airway resistance by anterior rhinomanometry. This suggests that there are different methods used to assess patients with CRS, but SNOT-22 is not mentioned. Therefore, it can be inferred that the answer is likely 'no'.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
