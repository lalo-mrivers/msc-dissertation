["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question does not provide any information about nintedanib or its relationship to bladder cancer. The provided documents discuss neocarzinostatin (NCS), a proteinous antitumor antibiotic, and its mechanism of accumulation in bladder tissue. Nitecapone is also discussed as a catechol-O-methyltransferase-inhibitor, but it does not seem relevant to this question. Quinidine is mentioned as an inhibitor of nortriptyline hydroxylation, but again, it does not appear related to this question. Volatile N-nitrosamines in urine are detected, and their levels vary between normal donors and bladder cancer patients. This information does not provide any insight into the effect of nintedanib on response rate in patients with bladder cancer.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
