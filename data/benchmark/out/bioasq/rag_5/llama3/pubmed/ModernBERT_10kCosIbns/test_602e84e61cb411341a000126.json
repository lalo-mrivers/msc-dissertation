["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the Analysis of interleukin 6 (IL-6)/IL-6 receptor system using monoclonal anti-IL-6 antibodies document, we know that there are two types of monoclonal antibodies against human IL-6, Type I mAb and Type II mAb. Type I mAb neutralizes IL-6 activity by blocking the binding of IL-6 to its receptor directly, whereas Type II mAb neutralizes IL-6 activity not by direct blocking of IL-6 binding to its receptor but by modulating the binding affinity of IL-6 to its receptor, that is, inhibiting the formation of high-affinity binding in IL-6 receptor system. This suggests that Tocilizumab (Actemra) which is a Type II mAb may be used to block/antagonize the IL-6 receptor indirectly by modulating the binding affinity of IL-6 to its receptor, rather than directly blocking it.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
