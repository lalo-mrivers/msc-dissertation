["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Upon reviewing the provided documents, I can see that luminol is a highly sensitive method for protein visualization following electrophoresis and protein blotting. It's based on the light-emitting reaction of luminol and hydrogen peroxide catalyzed by horseradish peroxidase. Rhodopsin is a visual pigment found in photoreceptor cells in the retina of various vertebrate species.\n\nThe documents don't suggest any evidence or mention of Luminopsins being fusion proteins of luminol and Rhodopsin. The documents only describe different methods and results, but there's no connection between luminol and Rhodopsin to form a new protein called Luminopsin.\n\nTherefore, based on the provided information, I conclude that Luminopsins are not fusion proteins of luminol and Rhodopsin.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
