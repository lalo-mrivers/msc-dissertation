["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the document 'Postoperative irradiation of glioblastomas. Results in a randomized series.' we can see that patients with glioblastoma who received postoperative irradiation had a 6-month survival rate of 64 per cent and a one-year survival rate of 19 per cent, while those who didn't receive irradiation had a 6-month survival rate of 28 per cent and a one-year survival rate of 0 per cent. This suggests that irradiation may not have improved the length or quality of survival in these patients. Furthermore, from the document 'Fast-neutron irradiation of glioblastoma multiforme. Neuropathological analysis.' we can see that patients who received fast neutron-beam irradiation became steroid-dependent and pursued a gradual downhill course with increasing obtundation, suggesting that irradiation may not have improved the outcome in these patients either. Therefore, it is possible that secondary glioblastomas can be caused by brain irradiation.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
