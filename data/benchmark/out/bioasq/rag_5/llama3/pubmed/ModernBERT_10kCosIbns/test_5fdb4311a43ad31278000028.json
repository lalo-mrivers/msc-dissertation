["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The provided documents describe enhancer-promoter interactions, enhancer-blocking assays, and protein-protein interactions. They do not provide direct evidence of directional targeting of gene promoters by enhancers. The first document states that every enhancer works with every promoter for all tested combinations, suggesting a permissive interaction rather than directional targeting. The enhancer-blocking assay in the second document shows that certain DNA segments can block enhancer activity, but this does not imply directionality. The other documents discuss enhancer-binding proteins and their interactions with promoters, but do not address the question of directional targeting. Therefore, based on the available information, it is unlikely that enhancers are directional in their targeting of gene promoters.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B: no\"\n}"]
