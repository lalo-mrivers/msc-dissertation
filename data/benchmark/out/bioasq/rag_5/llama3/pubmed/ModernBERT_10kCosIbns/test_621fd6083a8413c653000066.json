["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The passage discusses various methods for sequencing RNA, including 2'-O-methylated oligonucleotides in ribosomal 18S and 28S RNA of a mouse hepatoma, direct chemical method for sequencing RNA, methylation process of mammalian ribosomal precursor RNA, site specific enzymatic cleavage of RNA, and mapping adenines, guanines, and pyrimidines in RNA. There is no mention of DNA methylation in these passages, but we can conclude that the methylation process mentioned is specific to RNA, as it is described as occurring after transcription has been completed. Therefore, we can infer that the passage is discussing a type of modification that occurs on RNA, which implies that RNA can be methylated.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
