["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The study of oil of bergamot and its importance as a phototoxic agent. I. Characterization and quantification of the photoactive component. states that the phototoxicity of bergapten was found to be nearly the same as that of xanthotoxin (8-MOP) in tests on human skin. This suggests that bergapten can cause phototoxicity. Additionally, the study of oil of bergamot and its importance as a phototoxic agent. II. Factors which affect the phototoxic reaction induced by bergamot oil and psoralen derivatives states that using a standardized open photopatch test technique, the phototoxic reactions produced by bergapten were studied, implying that bergapten can indeed cause phototoxicity.\",\n\"answer_choice\": A"]
