["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Mucins are characterized as high-molecular-weight glycoproteins with a high level of O-linked oligosaccharides. They have an extended array of tandemly repeated peptides rich in potential O-glycosylation sites, which are responsible for their large size and extreme hydrophilicity. Therefore, mucins can be considered as glycosylated proteins.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
