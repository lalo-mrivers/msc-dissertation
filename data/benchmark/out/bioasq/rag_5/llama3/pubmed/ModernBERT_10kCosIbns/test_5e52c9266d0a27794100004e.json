["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks whether AhR ligands are attractive drug targets due to their induction of Cyp1a1. We look at the provided documents. The first document talks about purification and properties of rabbit C1 inactivator, which does not seem relevant to AhR or Cyp1a1. The second document discusses dioxin-dependent activation of murine Cyp1a-1 gene transcription requires protein kinase C-dependent phosphorylation. This suggests that AhR ligands can induce Cyp1a1 expression, making them attractive drug targets.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
