["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the molecular genetic investigations of CD63 as well as its immunochemical investigations. The document 'ME491 melanoma-associated glycoprotein family' states that CD63 is identical to the molecule recognized by ME491, NKI/C-3, and anti-NGA antibodies. This suggests that CD63 has been characterized as a protein found in human melanomas, but no information about its relationship with exosomes is provided. Therefore, it cannot be concluded from this document whether CD63 is an exosomal marker or not.\", \"answer_choice\": A}"]
