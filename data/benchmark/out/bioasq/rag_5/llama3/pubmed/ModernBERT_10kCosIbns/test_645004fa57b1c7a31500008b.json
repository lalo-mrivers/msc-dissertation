["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents provide information on enkephalins, their localization, and their effects. Enkephalins are peptides that act as neurotransmitters or hormones. They have been shown to have various functions, including an inhibiting action on somatostatin fibers and a direct action on pituitary glycoprotein-producing cells.\n\nThe question asks whether accessible enhancers (in this case, enkephalins) are necessarily active. Considering the documents, it can be concluded that not all accessible enhancers are active. For instance, the study on energy utilization for control shows that enzymes of bioenergetic pathways contribute to the control of flux rates, but this does not mean that all available energy is utilized.\n\nSimilarly, the study on synthesis of two enzyme-resistant enkephalin analogs possessing enhanced analgesic activity suggests that accessible enhancers (enkephalins) do not necessarily lead to activation. The analogs were stable and had good activity in certain assays, but their antinociceptive activity was reduced in morphine-tolerant animals.\n\nThe question also asks whether the mediodorsal crescent of intense enkephalin-ir staining in the dorsal lateral nucleus (DLN) is sexually dimorphic. The study on Sexually dimorphic, androgen sensitive, enkephalinergic afferents to a lumbar motor nucleus of rats suggests that this distribution is sexually dimorphic, as it was only observed in gonadally intact males.\n\nThe photoaffinity inactivation of the enkephalin receptor study shows that an arylazide enkephalin derivative can irreversibly inactivate the receptor, but this does not provide information on the activity of accessible enhancers.\n\nTherefore, based on the available evidence, it can be concluded that accessible enhancers (enkephalins) are not necessarily active.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B: no\""]
