["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to the study 'Monozygosity in twins: a detailed investigation', identical twins are characterized by similarities in their physical make-up. However, this study does not explicitly state that twin-twin transfusion syndrome is exclusive to monozygotic (identical) twins. The study 'Physiomorphology of twin transfusion syndrome' mentions that the placentas were examined and correlated with the clinical characteristics of the neonate, but it does not provide information on the zygosity of the twins. Therefore, we cannot conclusively determine whether the twins in twin-twin transfusion syndrome are identical or not based solely on these studies.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
