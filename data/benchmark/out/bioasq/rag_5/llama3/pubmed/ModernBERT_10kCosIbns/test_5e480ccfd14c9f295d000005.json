["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking if g-H2AX is a marker for double strand breaks. From the provided documents, we can see that X-ray-induced DNA double-strand breaks have been discussed and measured using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). The document 'Direct measurement by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis of induction and rejoining of X-ray-induced double-strand breaks in cultured mouse cells' specifically talks about the induction and rejoining of X-ray-induced double-strand breaks. g-H2AX is a histone variant that is phosphorylated at sites of DNA damage, including double strand breaks. Therefore, g-H2AX can be considered as a marker for double strand breaks.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
