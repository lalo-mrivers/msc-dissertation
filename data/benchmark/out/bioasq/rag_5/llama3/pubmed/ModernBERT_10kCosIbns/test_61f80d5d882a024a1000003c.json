["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, I analyzed the information about MEF2C. From the human myocyte-specific enhancer factor 2 document, it is stated that MEF2 transcripts are ubiquitous but accumulate preferentially in skeletal muscle, heart, and brain. Specific alternatively spliced isoforms are restricted to these tissues, correlating exactly with the presence of endogenous MEF2 activity. This suggests that MEF2C has a specific role in development and may be involved in developmental disorders. However, it does not explicitly state that only changes in coding regions of MEF2C cause developmental disorders.\n\nThe document about localization of the 5' end of the MCF2 oncogene to human chromosome 15q15----q23 discusses the activation of the MCF2 gene through substitution of part of its 5' coding region by unrelated nonsyntenic sequences. This does not directly relate to the role of MEF2C in development.\n\nThe other documents discuss different topics, such as sequence discrimination by alternatively spliced isoforms of a DNA binding zinc finger domain and localized mutagenesis of the ftsYEX operon: conditionally lethal missense substitutions in the FtsE cell division protein. These do not provide any information about MEF2C or its role in development.\n\nTherefore, based on the provided documents, I conclude that there is no evidence to suggest that only changes in coding regions of MEF2C cause developmental disorders.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B: no\""]
