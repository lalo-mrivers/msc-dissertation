["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The provided documents do not mention celecoxib or its effectiveness for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The first document discusses calcitonin gene-related peptide immunoreactivity in familial ALS and does not mention celecoxib. The second document describes Leigh's encephalomyelopathy in a patient with cytochrome c oxidase deficiency, but does not relate to celecoxib or ALS. The third document is about multifocal motor nerve conduction abnormalities in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and does not discuss treatment options, including celecoxib. The fourth document is about the treatment of metastatic chemodectoma, which is a different disease from ALS.
