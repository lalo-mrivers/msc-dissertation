["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks if G-quadruplexes (G4) are possible drug targets for glioblastoma. We need to consider the documents provided to answer this question. The first document discusses the effect of recombinant fibroblast interferon and immune interferon on growth and antigenic phenotype of multidrug-resistant human glioblastoma multiforme cells. This study does not mention G-quadruplexes or any related information.\n\nThe second document explores the effect of calmodulin inhibitors with bleomycin on patients with high-grade gliomas. Again, there is no mention of G-quadruplexes.\n\nThe third document discusses drug sensitivity tests against malignant gliomas and presents three in vivo models to evaluate anticancer drugs. This study does not provide any information about G-quadruplexes.\n\nThe fourth document examines increased expression of genes from growth factor signaling pathways in glioblastoma cell lines. It highlights the overexpression of certain growth factors but does not mention G-quadruplexes or its potential as a drug target for glioblastoma.\n\nLastly, the fifth document investigates local immunotherapy and systemic chemotherapy in primary glial tumors. This study also does not provide any information about G-quadruplexes.\n\nConsidering these documents, we can conclude that none of them specifically discuss G-quadruplexes (G4) as a potential drug target for glioblastoma. Therefore, based on the provided information, the answer to this question is:\n\n\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B: no\""]
