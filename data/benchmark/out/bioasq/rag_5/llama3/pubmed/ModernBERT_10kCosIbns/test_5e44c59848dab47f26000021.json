["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking whether tirilazad should be used for treatment of ischemic stroke. From the documents provided, we can see that tirilazad reduces cortical infarction after transient but not permanent focal cerebral ischemia in rats (experiment 1 and 2). This suggests that tirilazad may be beneficial in treating ischemic strokes caused by transient ischemia. However, it did not reduce infarct volume after permanent ischemia whether given intraperitoneally or intravenously (experiments 3 and 4). Therefore, the answer is\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
