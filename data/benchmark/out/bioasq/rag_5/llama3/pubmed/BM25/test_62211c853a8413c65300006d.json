["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about whether CircRNA is produced by back splicing of exon, intron or both. From the provided documents, we can see that back splicing can occur through different mechanisms. In the document 'Fate of the junction phosphate in alternating forward and reverse self-splicing reactions of group II intron RNA', it is shown that the labelled phosphorus atom is displaced in conjunction with the 3' exon from the ligation junction to the 3' splice site and vice versa. This suggests that back splicing can occur between exons or introns.\n\nIn the document 'Identification of cis-acting intron and exon regions in influenza virus NS1 mRNA that inhibit splicing and cause the formation of aberrantly sedimenting presplicing complexes', it is shown that two regions in NS1 mRNA inhibit splicing: a large intron region and an 85-nucleotide 3' exon region. The inhibitory activity of these regions is independent of their sequence identity, but the 3' exon region only functions when located at a specific position.\n\nIn the document 'Mutations causing defective splicing in the human hprt gene', it is shown that various types of mutations can cause splicing errors in the hprt gene. This suggests that back splicing can occur through different mechanisms and can be influenced by sequence differences between splice sites.\n\nFinally, in the document 'Activation of c-src neuron-specific splicing by an unusual RNA element in vivo and in vitro', it is shown that a conserved positive-acting RNA sequence is required for the neuron-specific splicing of the mouse c-src N1 exon. This suggests that back splicing can occur through the activation of specific sequences.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the provided documents, we can see that back splicing can occur through different mechanisms involving both exons and introns.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A: yes\""]
