["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the BRAFV600E mutation's effect on clinical response to radioiodine therapy. None of the provided documents mention BRAFV600E or radioiodine therapy together.

But there is no specific information about the BRAFV600E mutation's effect on clinical response to radioiodine therapy.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
