["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking whether human tumour-associated macrophages (TAMs) are good anticancer therapeutic targets. We can infer that TAMs may be capable of both low-grade surface resorption and high-grade lacunar resorption of bone, and a specific interaction with stromal cells is necessary for the latter to occur. This suggests that TAMs may directly contribute to the bone resorption associated with skeletal metastasis. Therefore, it seems reasonable to consider TAMs as potential therapeutic targets.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
