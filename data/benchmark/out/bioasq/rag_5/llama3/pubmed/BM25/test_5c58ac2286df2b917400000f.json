["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The provided documents do not explicitly discuss ibudilast's effectiveness for multiple sclerosis. The first document discusses the effect of ibudilast on airway hypersensitivity in bronchial asthma and does not mention multiple sclerosis. The second and third documents investigate the pharmacological reactions induced by ibudilast to the complement system with the aim of clarifying its functional relation to allergic reactions and pathology in patients with bronchial asthma, but do not provide information about multiple sclerosis. Finally, the fourth document discusses the phenotypic consequences of low arylsulfatase A genotypes (ASAp/ASAp and ASA-/ASAp) and examines whether there is an association with multiple sclerosis. However, it does not mention ibudilast's effectiveness for multiple sclerosis. Therefore, we can conclude that no direct information about the effectiveness of ibudilast for multiple sclerosis is provided.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B\n}"]
