["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking if cadherin is a plasma membrane marker. Let's look at the documents provided. In the first document, it says that T-cadherin is attached to the neuronal plasma membrane through a glycosyl phosphatidylinositol anchor. This suggests that cadherin can be found on the plasma membrane. Additionally, in the third document, it mentions that GalNAcPTase is stably associated with cadherin cell-cell adhesion molecules at the surface of pancreatic islet cells and RINm5F cells. This also implies that cadherin is present on the plasma membrane.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
