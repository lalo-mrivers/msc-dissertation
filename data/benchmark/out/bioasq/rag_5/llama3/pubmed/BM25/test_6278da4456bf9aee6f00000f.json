["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks if thalidomide is used as an immunomodulatory drug nowadays. The relevant documents mention that thalidomide was withdrawn from the market 30 years ago due to its teratogenic and neurotoxic adverse effects. However, it was later discovered to be effective in the treatment of erythema nodosum leprosum, a complication of lepromatous leprosy. Additionally, the documents state that thalidomide is presently used as an experimental drug in the treatment of various diseases with an autoimmune character, including recurrent aphthosis of non-viral and non-fungal origin in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) patients. This suggests that thalidomide is indeed used nowadays as an immunomodulatory drug.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
