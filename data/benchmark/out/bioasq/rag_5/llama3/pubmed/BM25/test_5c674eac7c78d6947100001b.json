["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The provided documents discuss various biological and clinical observations on neuroprotective agents. IL2 has been suggested for the treatment of acute leukemia patients. NG-nitro-L-arginine (NO-Arg) is a potent nitric oxide synthetase (NOS) inhibitor that produces essentially complete neuroprotection against hypoxic-ischemic injury in 7-day old rat pups. L-kynurenine has been shown to have neuroprotective effects on hypoxia-ischemia and NMDA lesions in neonatal rats. The documents do not mention Hesperidin, which suggests that it is not discussed as a neuroprotective agent.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
