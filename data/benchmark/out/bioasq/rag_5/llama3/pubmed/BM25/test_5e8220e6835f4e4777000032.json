["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The enzymic conversion of protoporphyrinogen IX to protoporphyrin IX was studied in mammalian mitochondria. It has been extracted from rat liver mitochondria by sonication in the presence of salt and detergent and partially purified. The molecular weight of the enzyme is approximately 35,000. This suggests that Protoporphyrinogen oxidase is localized to the mitochondrium.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
