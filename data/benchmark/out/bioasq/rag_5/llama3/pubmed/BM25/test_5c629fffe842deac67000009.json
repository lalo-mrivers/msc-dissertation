["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"There is no direct relevance to GRG5 (Groucho related gene 5) in the provided documents. However, I can analyze each document for any hints or parallels that might help answer this question. Document 1 discusses cataract and various aspects of lens metabolism, with no mention of Groucho or its related genes. Document 2 explores rare codons and their roles during differentiation in Streptomyces spp., which is unrelated to GRG5. Documents 3 and 4 discuss breast milk-derived hormones and NCAM (neural cell adhesion molecule), respectively, but neither has any connection to GRG5 or its role in development. Document 5 examines gene expression in the temperate coliphage 186, focusing on the late control function B, which is not relevant to GRG5. Considering these documents, I can infer that there is no direct evidence supporting a role for GRG5 only in late development.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B: no\""]
