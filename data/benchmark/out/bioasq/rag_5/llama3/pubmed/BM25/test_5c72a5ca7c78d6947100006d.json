["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents provided describe the regional distribution of brain gangliosides in Alzheimer's disease, the composition of whole brain synaptosomal gangliosides from mice genetically bred for divergent ethanol sensitivities, an immunohistological study on brains of Alzheimer's disease using antibodies to fetal antigens, C-series gangliosides and microtubule-associated protein 5, and a study on human brain gangliosides in development, aging and disease. These studies demonstrate that major brain gangliosides are altered in Alzheimer's disease, with decreases in ganglio-series gangliosides and increases in simple gangliosides. This suggests that major brain gangliosides may be involved in the pathogenesis of the disease and could potentially be a target for treatment.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
