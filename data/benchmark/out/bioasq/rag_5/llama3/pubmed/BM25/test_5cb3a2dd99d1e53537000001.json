["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"CD63 is a lysosome integral membrane protein (LIMP-CD63) that is located on the basophilic granule membrane of resting basophils. After activation, it is translocated to the exterior of the plasma membrane. It is also expressed in polymorphonuclear granulocytes and macrophages. In neutrophils, CD63 is an azurophilic granule marker that requires GTP-gamma-S besides 1 microM Ca2+ for a significant up-regulation. During HIV-1 infection of H9 cells, the CD63 antigen is located mainly in the cytoplasm of uninfected cells but is significantly more expressed on infected cells. Additionally, AD1 Ag, which is homologous to human CD63 or melanoma-associated Ag ME491, is a mast cell marker in tissue and is also associated with other cells in culture.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A: yes\""]
