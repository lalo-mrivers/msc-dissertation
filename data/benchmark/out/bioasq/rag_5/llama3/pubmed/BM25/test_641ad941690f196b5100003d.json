["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks if LOQ (limit of quantitation) and LOD (limit of detection) are the same. From the document 'Validation of methods used in the Florida Department of Agricultural and Consumer Services' Chemical Residue Laboratory', we can see that LOQ is defined as 10 times the background signal contributed by a sample matrix blank, whereas LOD is equivalent to 3 times this value. This suggests that LOQ is a more stringent measure than LOD, implying that they are not the same.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B: no\""]
