["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Protamines were isolated from human sperm nuclei in the reduced form and their interaction with zinc and cobalt was studied. P1 and P2 protamines were recognized by auto-antibodies. The sera of vasectomized men and of patients with immune infertility were used to study the antigens and epitopes of sperm nuclear proteins that bind antibodies in these sera. No reaction with sperm histones was observed except for one serum. Studies with peptides derived from P1 and P2 protamines and with mammalian protamines related to HP1 showed that antibodies are mainly specific for a folded protamine molecule, more especially antibodies from vasectomized men. This observation suggests that the two classes of protamines, different in sequence, may have a similar folding and thereby may be functionally equivalent.\n\nComparative analysis of the nuclear basic proteins in rat, human, guinea pig, mouse and rabbit spermatozoa. Cysteine-rich protamines (Arg = 47-61%, Cys = 8-16%) were isolated from the sperm of an individual guinea pig, human and rabbit and from pooled samples of mouse and rat sperm.\n\nFrom these documents, we can conclude that protamines are not ubiquitously expressed in all species. Protamines are specific to certain species such as human, guinea pig, and rabbit.\n\nHistones instead of protamines in terminal germ cells of infertile, oligospermic men. A study was carried out, by means of polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, of the nucleoproteins of spermatozoa from infertile, oligospermic patients affected by partial idiopathic spermatidic arrest.\n\nImprovement in the resolution of human sperm protamines by use of iodoacetamide as alkylating agent. By use of the neutral alkylating agent iodo [14C1] acetamide instead of ethylene imine or iodoacetate, the resolution of human protamines on gel electrophoresis and ion-exchange chromatography has been improved.\n\nAuto-antibodies to human sperm basic nuclear proteins in infertile and vasectomized men: characterization of antigens and epitopes recognized by antibodies. The sera of vasectomized men and of patients with immune infertility were used to study the antigens and epitopes of sperm nuclear proteins that bind antibodies in these sera.\n\nFrom the documents above, we can conclude that protamines are present in certain species such as human, guinea pig, and rabbit but not ubiquitously expressed in all species. For example, histones instead of protamines were found in terminal germ cells of infertile, oligospermic men.\n\nThe presence or absence of protamines depends on the species.\n\n\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
