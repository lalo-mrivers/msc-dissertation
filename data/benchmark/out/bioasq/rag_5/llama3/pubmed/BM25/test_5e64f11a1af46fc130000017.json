["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the genome of Paramyxovirus. We can look at the relevant documents to find information about Paramyxovirus. In [Paramyxovirus membrane protein enhances antibody production to new antigenic determinants in the actin molecule: a model for virus-induced autoimmunity], it's mentioned that the 'S' crabe virus recently isolated from Macropipus depurator (Decapoda) has been purified and its nucleic acid has been recognized as a DNA. Later on, it's also stated that Paramyxovirus, presumably measles, was recovered by cocultivation or cell-fusion techniques from jejunal biopsy specimens of 6 consecutive patients with multiple sclerosis. This suggests that the genome is not segmented RNA, but rather DNA. However, we need to look at more information to determine if it's negative-sense RNA or positive-sense RNA.\",\n\"answer_choice\": A"]
