["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided, it is mentioned that blockade of the type I IGF receptor by a monoclonal antibody (alpha IR3) has been used as a strategy to demonstrate the importance of the IGF pathway. Although alpha IR3 could not block serum-free growth of breast cancer cell lines, it could inhibit anchorage independent growth in most cell lines in the presence of serum. In vivo, alpha IR3 administered at the time of tumor cell inoculation could inhibit MDA-MB-231 tumor formation in athymic mice; however, inhibition of established tumors was not seen. Moreover, alpha IR3 could not inhibit tumor formation of the MCF-7 cell line in vivo. These results suggest that blockade of the type I IGF receptor can inhibit the growth of some breast cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
