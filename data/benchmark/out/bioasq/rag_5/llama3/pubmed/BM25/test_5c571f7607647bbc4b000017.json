["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents indicate that exposure to heavy metals can affect DNA methylation patterns. For instance, the study on metallothionein genes shows that DNA methylation is correlated with cell-type specific regulation of MT gene expression and that 5-azacytidine treatment results in changes in DNA methylation. Additionally, another study suggests that alterations in DNA methylation are associated with transformation process. Based on these findings, it can be inferred that exposure to heavy metals like lead(Pb) or cadmium(Cd) may cause changes in DNA methylation patterns.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
