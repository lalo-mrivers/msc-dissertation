["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about microexon alternative splicing of small GTPase regulators having implications in central nervous system diseases. The provided documents are related to NCAM VASE exon expression, NF1 gene regulation, SF2 protein function, and U1 snRNP particle binding. Since there is no direct mention of microexon alternative splicing or small GTPase regulators in the given texts, we must consider possible connections between the concepts. The documents do not provide any clear evidence linking these topics to central nervous system diseases.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
