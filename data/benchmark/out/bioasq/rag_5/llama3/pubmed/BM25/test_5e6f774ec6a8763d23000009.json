["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to [Morphogenesis and function of gas caps on spores of anaerobic bacteria of the genus Clostridium], Clostridium species form gas vacuoles in the intraexosporial space, which impart increased floatation to spores. This suggests that these bacteria may not require oxygen for survival or growth. Additionally, [Factors related to the oxygen tolerance of anaerobic bacteria] shows that some Clostridium strains can survive exposure to atmospheric oxygen for more than 72 hours. Therefore, it is likely that bacteria in the genus Clostridium are anaerobes rather than facultative anaerobes.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
