["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents describe various aspects of interferons, including their antigenic properties, molecular alterations, and physico-chemical characteristics. Interferons are known to have anti-viral activities and can be induced by viruses or chemical/enzymatic treatments. They can also be altered in terms of size, charge, and host-range through such treatments. The documents do not explicitly state that interferons are defensive proteins, but they do describe their role in responding to viral infections and inhibiting the replication of viruses. Therefore, it can be inferred that interferons play a defensive function against viral attacks.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A: yes\""]
