["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the properties of different types of stem cells. The first document mentions multipotent stem cells in metanephric mesenchyme that can generate at least three distinct cell types; glomerular, proximal and distal epithelia. This suggests that these stem cells are indeed multipotent. The second document discusses mammalian neural crest cells that are also multipotent, able to generate at least neurons and Schwann cells. Again, this implies that these cells have the ability to differentiate into multiple cell types. Finally, the fourth document mentions the efficiency of retroviral vectors in targeting hematopoietic stem and precursor cell lines, but notes a block to retroviral infection in more primitive cells, which suggests that these cells are not yet fully differentiated and are still multipotent. Overall, based on this information, it can be concluded that MSCs (metanephric mesenchyme) are indeed multipotent cells.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
