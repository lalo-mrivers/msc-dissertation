["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about secondary glioblastoma. There is a document about primary and secondary glioblastomas, it distinguishes them by glutamate dehydrogenase activity. The study states that if the survival postoperative time was more than twelve months, then it's a secondary glioblastoma. There is no mention of brain irradiation in this document. So, we need to look for other documents. One document talks about hepatic coma and reduction of brain noradrenaline or dopamine, but it doesn't have any relevance to the question. Another document discusses extracranial metastases of glioblastoma multiforme, which is not related to brain irradiation either. The last document describes primary brain tumours presenting as spontaneous intracerebral haemorrhage, and there's no mention of brain irradiation here too. Therefore, we can conclude that the answer cannot be found in these documents.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
