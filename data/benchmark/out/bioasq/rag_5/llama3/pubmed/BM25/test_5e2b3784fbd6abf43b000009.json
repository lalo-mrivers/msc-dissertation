["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks whether GRG5 is involved only in late embryonic mouse development. Upon reviewing the provided documents, I see that none of them mention GRG5 or its involvement in late embryonic mouse development. The first document discusses cataracts and lens metabolism, but does not mention GRG5. The second document talks about DNA replication in mice and chromosome 15, but does not mention GRG5 either. The third document discusses nerve growth factor's role in retinal ganglion cells, and the fourth document examines beta amyloid protein precursor mRNA expression in mouse brain. None of these documents provide information on GRG5 or its involvement in late embryonic mouse development.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B: no\""]
