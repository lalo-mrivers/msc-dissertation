["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The concept of enhancers refers to specific DNA sequences that can interact with transcription factors to regulate gene expression. In the context of the given documents, particularly the study on immunoglobulin kappa gene enhancers, it is clear that both enhancers are required for maximal gene expression, but they act independently in determining specific chromatin structures. This suggests that the presence of an enhancer does not necessarily imply its activity. Therefore, I conclude that accessible enhancers are not necessarily active.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
