This document describes the isolation and characterization of a proteasome subunit (XC3) from Xenopus ovary cDNA libraries. The text states that the proteasome is a non-lysosomal proteinase complex ubiquitously distributed in eukaryotic cells, suggesting that it is a general term for a type of enzyme complex involved in protein degradation. Bortezomib is a specific inhibitor of the proteasome complex.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A: yes\"\n}"]
