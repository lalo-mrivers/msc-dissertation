["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The comet assay is a single-cell microgel electrophoresis technique that measures DNA strand breaks. The documents provided suggest that the comet assay can be used to measure radiation-induced DNA damage and repair synthesis in human lymphocytes. Additionally, the growth fraction measured using the comet assay is defined as the fraction of cells containing elevated numbers of DNA strand breaks. This indicates that the comet assay can detect radiation-induced mutations.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
