["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"There is no direct mention of IDO (indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase) in the provided documents. However, we can infer that IFNg does not induce the expression of MHC class I and II molecules on extra-embryonic tissues based on the study 'In vivo treatment with interferon-gamma during early pregnancy in mice induces strong expression of major histocompatibility complex class I and II molecules in uterus and decidua but not in extra-embryonic tissues.' Additionally, we know that IFNg can induce the expression of MHC molecules on decidual cells in intimate contact with extra-embryonic tissues. This suggests that IFNg may have a specific effect on certain types of cells or tissues, rather than inducing a general immune response.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
