["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to the provided documents, tumour specific antigens can arise from two major mechanisms: mutational and activation of a silent gene. In the case of methylcholanthrene-induced tumours and ultraviolet light-induced tumours, the antigens appear to be produced by point mutations in genes that are normally expressed. On the other hand, P815 tumour rejection antigen appears to arise through the activation of a silent gene. Therefore, it is possible that some tumour specific antigens may originate from known protein coding genes.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
