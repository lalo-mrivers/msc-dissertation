["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The provided documents discuss prions and their role in scrapie of animals and Gerstmann-Str√§ussler syndrome (GSS) of humans. The studies involve transgenic mice expressing both Syrian hamster and mouse PrP genes, which encode proteins differing at 16 residues out of 254. The results show that the prion inoculum dictates which prions are synthesized de novo, even though the cells express both PrP genes. This suggests that species specificity of scrapie prions resides in the primary structure of PrP and formation of infectious prions is initiated by a species-specific interaction between PrPSc in the inoculum and homologous, cellular PrP. There is no mention of yeast prions or their use as models for studying human amyloid diseases.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B: no\""]
