["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks whether epigenetic modifications can be heritable. In the first document, it is mentioned that genome imprinting confers functional differences on parental chromosomes as a result of the differences in epigenetic inheritance from parental germlines. This suggests that epigenetic modifications can indeed be heritable. The concept of 'imprints' and the influence of epigenetic modifications on gene expression and phenotypic variations also support this idea. Furthermore, the fact that modifier genes can affect their parental origin, perhaps partly by the maternally inherited oocyte cytoplasmic factors, implies that epigenetic modifications can be transmitted from one generation to the next.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
