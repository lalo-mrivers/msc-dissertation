["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks if disruption of immune regulation mechanisms is associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes, including preeclampsia. We have documents that discuss maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein (MS-AFP), beta-HCG, and placental abnormalities in relation to adverse pregnancy outcomes. There is also an article about the natural history of chronic proteinuria complicating pregnancy. From these documents, we can infer that elevated MS-AFP levels are associated with placental lesions and poor pregnancy outcomes, including preeclampsia. Furthermore, there is evidence that aberrant wave of endovascular trophoblast migration in preeclampsia results in focal disruption of the endothelium, which may be responsible for endothelial cell dysfunction thought to be of pathogenetic importance in preeclampsia.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
