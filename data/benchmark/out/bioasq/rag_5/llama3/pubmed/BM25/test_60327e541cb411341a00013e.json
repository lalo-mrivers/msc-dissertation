This is evident from the first document, which describes two cases of brothers with Hunter's syndrome, one with dentigerous cysts and the other with collagenous connective lesions. The fact that both brothers had the condition suggests a possible X-linkage.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe second document also supports this conclusion as it states that segregation analysis on five samples of families with Hunter's syndrome shows that the mutant allele segregates in agreement with Mendelian expectations for an X-linked recessive disease.\", \"answer_choice\": A}"]
