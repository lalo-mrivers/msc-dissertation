["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the provided documents, we can see that APP is transported axonally in neurons of the rat peripheral nervous system through fast anterograde transport (document 2). This suggests that APP can be found in nerve processes. In document 3, it is mentioned that a major part of the APP present in the neuritic component of senile plaques is a fragment representing the N-terminal one-third of the molecule. Additionally, document 4 shows that APP immunoreactivity was present in cell bodies, proximal dendrites, and axons of cortical neurons. This suggests that APP can be found in neuronal cells and their processes.\n\nDocument 1 discusses the purification and partial characterization of APP from human brain. It does not specifically mention exosomes or their relationship to APP. However, document 5 describes the formation of exosomes as a mechanism for shedding membrane proteins during reticulocyte maturation. This process involves the selective loss of certain proteins from the plasma membrane.\n\nConsidering this information, it is reasonable to conclude that brain-derived exosomes can carry APP molecules.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
