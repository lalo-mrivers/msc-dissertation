["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the development and function of CD8+ cells and CD4+ helper T cells. The CD4 gene has been disrupted in mice, resulting in markedly decreased helper cell activity for antibody responses, but normal cytotoxic T-cell activity against viruses. This suggests that CD4 is not essential for CD8+ T-cell development or function. Additionally, the documents describe studies on T-cell subsets, including purified CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, which respond to various protein antigens of Francisella tularensis. The response of CD8+ T cells depends on cytokines supplied by proliferating CD4+ T cells.\n\nThe documents also discuss the role of CD4+ suppressor cells in regulating the induction and expansion of CD8+ protective T cells. This suggests that CD4+ and CD8+ T cells have distinct functions and may be generated through different mechanisms.\n\nFinally, the documents describe studies on IL-2 receptor expression on CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, including naive and memory populations. This information does not directly address the question of whether CD8+ (cytotoxic) T cells and CD4+ helper T cells are generated in the thyroid or express the T-cell receptor.\n\nTherefore, based on this information, it appears that CD8+ and CD4+ T cells may be generated through different mechanisms and have distinct functions, but the specific location of their generation and expression is not addressed by these documents. The answer to the question must be inferred from the broader context.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B: no\"\n}"]
