["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks whether NfL (neurofilament light chain) is a biomarker of neurodegeneration. The relevant documents describe different types of biomarkers, such as antigenic biomarkers that can be detected using immunochemical techniques. NfL is mentioned in the document 'Noradrenergic-induced expression of c-fos in rat cortex: neuronal localization' as a neuronal marker. This suggests that NfL may be used to identify and quantitate exposure to hazardous substances within the central nervous system, making it a potential biomarker of neurodegeneration.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
