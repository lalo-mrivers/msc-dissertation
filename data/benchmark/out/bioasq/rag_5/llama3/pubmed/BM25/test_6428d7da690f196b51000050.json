["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking if untranslated regions (UTRs) can regulate gene expression. Based on the provided documents, we can see that UTRs are mentioned as playing a role in regulating IGF-II production through specific endonucleolytic cleavage, and also in the TGF-beta 2 gene where the 3' UTR is highly conserved suggesting it may play an important role in expression. Additionally, we see examples of UTRs being involved in the regulation of protein temporal gradients in the lin-14 gene. Therefore, it can be concluded that yes, untranslated regions (UTRs) can regulate gene expression.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
