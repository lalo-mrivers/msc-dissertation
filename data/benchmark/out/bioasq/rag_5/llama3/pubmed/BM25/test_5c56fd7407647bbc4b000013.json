["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant studies are about segmental epidural analgesia for labor and delivery, lumbar epidural analgesia for labor and delivery of twins, and butorphanol for the relief of shivering associated with extradural anesthesia in parturients. The question is asking if epidural anesthesia affects the Apgar score of the infant. In the study on segmental epidural analgesia, it was found that fetal outcome was excellent in all cases, with a one-minute Apgar score never lower than 7. This suggests that epidural anesthesia did not affect the Apgar score. In the study on lumbar epidural analgesia for labor and delivery of twins, Apgar scores were virtually the same as those for singleton controls. Therefore, it can be concluded that epidural anesthesia does not affect the Apgar score.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
