["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks whether enhancers are directional in their targeting of gene promoters. In the context of immunoglobulin genes, the documents show that the enhancers can synergistically activate gene expression but independently determine chromatin structure. This suggests that the directionality of enhancer-targeting might be dependent on specific genomic contexts. Furthermore, the Drosophila melanogaster studies demonstrate that DNA position-specific repression of transcription by a zinc finger protein can occur through interactions between enhancers and promoters. This implies that enhancers may not necessarily have an inherent directional targeting property, but rather their interaction with gene promoters is influenced by local chromatin structure and regulatory elements. The auditory targeting reflexes in dogs suggest that the directionality of stimulus-response connections might be dependent on specific spatial contiguity factors, which is different from the context of enhancer-targeting. Based on these findings, it appears that enhancers are not necessarily directional in their targeting of gene promoters.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
