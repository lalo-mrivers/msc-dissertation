["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The first document suggests that at least 95% of synonymous substitutions in Hbbeta are functionally unacceptable in homozygous state. This implies functional constraint on synonymous sites. The second document shows higher rates of amino acid substitution in rodents than humans, indicating a faster evolutionary rate. However, this does not directly address the question of whether synonymous sites are functionally constrained. The third document discusses the evolution of rbcL gene sequences among seed plants and finds extensive variation in synonymous and nonsynonymous rates of substitution. This suggests that functional constraint may play a role in determining the rate of synonymous substitutions. Finally, the fourth document highlights the association between polymorphic sites in the apo A-IV gene and changes in lipid concentrations. This provides indirect evidence for functional constraint on synonymous sites.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
