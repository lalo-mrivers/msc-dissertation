["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about GRHL2 over-expression leading to EMT. However, the provided documents do not mention GRHL2 or EMT (Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition). The studies focus on c-erbB-2, c-myc, HER-2/neu, and P-glycoprotein expressions in different types of cancer. Therefore, there is no direct evidence to support or refute the claim that GRHL2 over-expression leads to EMT.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
