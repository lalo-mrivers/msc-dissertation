["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about gut microbiota profiles altered by irradiation. None of the provided documents mention irradiation or its effects on gut microbiota profiles. The first document discusses the morphology of gut microbiota in termites, while the second and third documents examine the gut microbiota of humans with short bowel syndrome and patients with periodontal diseases, respectively. The fourth document investigates the response of soil microbiota to herbicides. Since none of these documents provide information on irradiation's effects on gut microbiota profiles, it can be inferred that there is no evidence to suggest alterations in gut microbiota profiles due to irradiation.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
