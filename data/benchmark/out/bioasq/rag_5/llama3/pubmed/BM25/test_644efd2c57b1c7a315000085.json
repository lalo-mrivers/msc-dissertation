["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, epigenetic changes refer to alterations in gene expression that are heritable but potentially reversible. This is supported by the theory that damage to DNA followed by repair can lead to loss of methyl groups and induce a switch in gene activity which is heritable but potentially reversible. Additionally, the text states that epigenetic phenomena evolved from the interaction of man's biological givens with civilization. This suggests that epigenetic changes are not necessarily related to changes in the DNA sequence.\", \"answer_choice\": B}"]
