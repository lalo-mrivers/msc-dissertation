["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Phospholipid hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidase (PHGPx) is a selenoenzyme distinct from the classical glutathione peroxidase as evident from cDNA and amino acid sequencing. The primary structure of PHGPx was partially elucidated by sequencing peptides obtained by cyanogen bromide cleavage and tryptic digestion and by isolating and sequencing corresponding cDNA fragments covering about 75% of the total sequence. Based on these data, PHGPx can be rated as a selenoprotein homologous to classical glutathione peroxidase.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
