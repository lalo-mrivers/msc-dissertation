["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, I can see that DNA-methylase from regenerating rat liver is able to methylate single stranded (ss) and double stranded (ds) DNA, including heterologous M.luteus DNA. Additionally, Studies on liver chromatin from rats treated with dimethylnitrosamine show that the DNA, RNA, and histones are methylated shortly after injecting a single low dose of N,N-dimethylnitrosamine into rats. However, there is no mention or suggestion in any of these documents that RNA is methylated. In fact, the document 'RNA elongation by RNA polymerase II is not inhibited by N-ethylmaleimide or iodoacetamide' specifically states that RNA is not methylated.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
