["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Metoprolol was metabolized by O-demethylation with subsequent oxidation and by aliphatic hydroxylation of the methoxy-ethyl substituent and by oxidative deamination of the propanolisopropylamine side-chain. The same routes of metabolism in the rat in vivo were revealed from urinary metabolites. This suggests that metoprolol is metabolized, but the specific cytochrome P450 isoform involved is not specified. However, a later study found that O-demethylation was the major pathway of oxidative metabolism in the dog.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
