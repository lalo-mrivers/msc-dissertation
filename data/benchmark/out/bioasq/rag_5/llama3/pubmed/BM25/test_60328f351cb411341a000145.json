["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking if Freund's complete adjuvant can induce arthritis. We can look at the documents for clues. In the first document, it states that animals were injected intra-articularly with antigen after prior immunization with that antigen in Freund's incomplete adjuvant to precipitate immune complexes in the surfaces of menisci, ligaments, and cartilage. Then on reimmunization with antigen in Freund's complete adjuvant 10 weeks later, generally an arthritis limited to the intercondylar fossa developed. However, it also states that on intra-articular injection of antigen a second time a widespread arthritis developed in that joint. This suggests that Freund's complete adjuvant can induce arthritis.\n\nIn the third document, it is mentioned that Freund's complete adjuvant facilitated excellent delayed hypersensitivity skin reactions to native as well as denatured collagen. Delayed hypersensitivity is often associated with immune responses such as arthritis.\n\nIn the fourth document, it does not mention anything about Freund's complete adjuvant inducing arthritis.\n\nTherefore, based on the documents, we can conclude that\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
