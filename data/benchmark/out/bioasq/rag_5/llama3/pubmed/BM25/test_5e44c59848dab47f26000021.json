["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about using tirilazad for treatment of ischemic stroke. The relevant document is 'Clinical efficacy of tirilazad mesylate for treatment of endotoxemia in neonatal calves'. It seems that the study evaluated the clinical efficacy of tirilazad mesylate for prophylaxis and treatment of endotoxemia, which is different from ischemic stroke. However, the document does not provide direct information about using tirilazad for ischemic stroke. Another relevant document 'What have drugs to offer the patient with acute stroke?' mentions that there are no proven treatments for ischaemic stroke or intracerebral haemorrhage. Therefore, based on the available information, it is not possible to conclude whether tirilazad should be used for treatment of ischemic stroke.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
