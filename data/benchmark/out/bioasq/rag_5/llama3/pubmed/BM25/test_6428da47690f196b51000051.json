["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to the document 'Construction and characterization of herpes simplex type 1 viruses without introns', it is stated that the loss of both IE-1 intron sequences resulted in the elimination of the ability of a plasmid-encoded IE-1 to activate gene expression. This suggests that the epigenetic status of introns can affect gene expression. Additionally, the document 'Environmental carcinogenesis: an integrative model' discusses how environmental carcinogens can alter the genetic control of cell division and differentiation, which can be affected by the epigenetic status of introns.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
