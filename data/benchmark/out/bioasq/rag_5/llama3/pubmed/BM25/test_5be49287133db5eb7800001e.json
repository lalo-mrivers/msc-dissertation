["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"There is no direct information about pembrolizumab's effectiveness against Ewing's sarcoma in the provided documents. However, we can look at related studies. The document 'Leukocyte migration inhibition in patients with Ewing's sarcoma by 3-M potassium chloride extracts of fresh and tissue-cultured Ewing's sarcomas' suggests that many patients with Ewing's sarcoma have cell-mediated immunity toward TAA on Ewing's sarcomas, which implies that the immune system plays a role in fighting the disease. Pembrolizumab is an immunotherapy drug that targets PD-1 and has been shown to be effective against various types of cancer.
