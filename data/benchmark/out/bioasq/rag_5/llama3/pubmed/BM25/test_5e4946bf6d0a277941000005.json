["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The provided texts mainly discuss comparative studies of different viruses, diseases, and genetic regulations. The concept of genomic regulatory blocks (GRBs) is not explicitly mentioned. However, the study on fowlpox virus genes reveals that there are blocks of sequence within which genes exist in the same relative position in fowlpox and vaccinia viruses, but their genomic locations differ widely between the two viruses. This comparison suggests that genomic regulatory blocks might refer to similar gene arrangements or homologous regions between different genomes.\", \"answer_choice\": A}"]
