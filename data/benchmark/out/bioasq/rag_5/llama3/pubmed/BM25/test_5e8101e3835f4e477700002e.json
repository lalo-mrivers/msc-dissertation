["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking if cathepsin L is active in endosomes. The relevant documents mention that cathepsin L forms complexes with a cysteine proteinase inhibitor and is involved in the degradation of proteins such as azocasein and gelatin. However, there is no specific information about the location where this activity occurs, i.e., whether it's in endosomes or not. Additionally, one of the documents mentions that cathepsin L is sorted for targeting to yeast vacuole, which suggests that its primary function might be in lysosomes rather than endosomes.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B: no\"\n}"]
