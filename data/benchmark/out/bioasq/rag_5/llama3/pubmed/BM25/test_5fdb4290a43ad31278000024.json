["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The polycomb group (Pc-G) genes in Drosophila melanogaster are required for maintenance of correct spatial expression of homeotic genes. The finding of genetic and molecular similarities to components involved in heterochromatin formation led to the proposal that homeotic genes are permanently repressed by mechanisms similar to those responsible for heterochromatin compaction. Polycomb and polyhomeotic, two members of the Pc-G, are constituents of a soluble multimeric protein complex. The same binding patterns on polytene chromosomes were demonstrated for both proteins. This suggests that some Pc-G proteins act in multimeric complexes to compact the chromatin of stably repressed genes like the homeotic regulators.\",\n\"answer_choice\": A"]
