["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking whether the Mcm2-Ctf4-Polα axis plays a role in transferring histones to leading strand DNA at replication forks. The relevant documents describe various aspects of DNA replication and chromosome segregation, but they do not explicitly mention the Mcm2-Ctf4-Polα axis or its involvement in histone transfer. Therefore, we must rely on our understanding of the replication process and look for similarities between the described systems and the question being asked.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
