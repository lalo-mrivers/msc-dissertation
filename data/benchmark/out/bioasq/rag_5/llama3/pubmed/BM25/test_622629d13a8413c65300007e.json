["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about whether FTO (fatty acid) can promote pancreatic cancer development. In the 'Dietary fat and the development of pancreatic cancer' document, it is mentioned that high intakes of dietary unsaturated fats of the n-6 series enhance or promote tumor development in rodent models of pancreatic cancer. Additionally, it is stated that certain dietary unsaturated fats appear to selectively enhance the growth rate of carcinogen-induced, pre-cancerous lesions. This suggests that FTO can potentially promote pancreatic cancer development.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
