["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Phospholemman is described as a 72-amino acid cardiac sarcolemmal protein with a single transmembrane domain. This suggests that it has some kind of interaction or association with the membrane. Additionally, the fact that it can induce a chloride-selective current in Xenopus oocytes when expressed functionally implies that it must be interacting with the plasma membrane in some way. Therefore, based on these characteristics and functions, Phospholemman is likely to be a membrane protein.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
