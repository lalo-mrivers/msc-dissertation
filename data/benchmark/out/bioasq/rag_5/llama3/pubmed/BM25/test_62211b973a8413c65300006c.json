["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about G-quadruplexes (G4) as possible drug targets for glioblastoma. The provided documents do not explicitly mention G-quadruplexes or glioblastoma. However, the document on 'Natural products as probes for new drug target identification' mentions various receptors and signal transduction pathways that can be targeted by drugs. Although this is not directly related to G4, it suggests that identifying novel targets for drug development is a possibility. Therefore, considering the context of molecular targeting in cancer therapy mentioned in the document on 'Are there molecular targets for therapy of colon cancer?', it is possible that G-quadruplexes could be considered as potential drug targets for glioblastoma.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
