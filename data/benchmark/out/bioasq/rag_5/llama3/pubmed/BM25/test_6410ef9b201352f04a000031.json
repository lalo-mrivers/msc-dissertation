["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about modulation of KCNQ1 splicing preventing arrhythmias. There are no relevant documents provided that directly address this specific topic. However, we can look for general information on splicing regulation and whether it has any relation to arrhythmias or cardiac-related issues. The provided documents discuss the regulation of mRNA splicing in various contexts, including viral infections and cellular processes. There is no direct connection made between splicing modulation and arrhythmias. Therefore, we must rely on our understanding of the general principles of splicing regulation and their potential implications for cardiac health.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
