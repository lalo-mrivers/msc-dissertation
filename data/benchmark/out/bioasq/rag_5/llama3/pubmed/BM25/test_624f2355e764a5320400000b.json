["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents provided do not explicitly discuss the 22-item sino-nasal outcome test (SNOT-22) or its association with chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS). However, one of the papers discusses a questionnaire used to assess the result of surgery for peptic ulcer. Although it's not exactly the SNOT-22, it does mention that the questionnaire can be used as an alternative to the Follow-Up Clinic and as an indicator of quality of life.
