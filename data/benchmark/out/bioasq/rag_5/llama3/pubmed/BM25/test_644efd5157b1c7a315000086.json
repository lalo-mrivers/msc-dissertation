["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Epigenetic changes refer to environmental or lifestyle factors that affect gene activity without altering the DNA sequence itself. The provided documents discuss epigenetic mechanisms, such as chromatin structure and histone modifications, which can lead to heritable changes in gene expression. For instance, the study on Drosophila suggests that the chromatin structure is a mechanism of epigenetic changes that can be inherited through cell lineages. Similarly, the article on diabetes transmission proposes an 'epigenetic (\"teratogenetic\") mode' where maternal influence may lead to heritable changes in offspring. The age incidence curves for cancer also imply that epigenetic changes can be programmed to occur randomly, suggesting heritability. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that epigenetic changes are heritable.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
