["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"ADP-ribosylation is a process where an ADP-ribose group is added to a protein or molecule. This process can be catalyzed by enzymes such as pertussis toxin or endogenous ADP-ribose transferases. In the provided documents, several examples of ADP-ribosylation are discussed, including the ADP-ribosylation of proteins in rat brain and platelets. Additionally, it is mentioned that nitric oxide can stimulate ADP-ribosylation of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. Based on this information, it appears that ADP-ribosylation is a post-translational modification (PTM).\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
