["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The provided documents discuss radiation-induced meningiomas, their characteristics, and treatment options. Radiation-induced meningiomas can be categorized into three groups based on the amount of radiation administered: low dose, moderate dose, and high dose. The overwhelming majority of cases had received low-dose irradiation for tinea capitis. Although histologically atypical tumors were common in this series, overt malignancy was not encountered. Preoperative management of these lesions should include angiography to evaluate for large-vessel occlusive vasculopathy, a known association of meningiomas induced by high-dose irradiation. Given the propensity these tumors possess for recurrence, a wide bony and dural margin is recommended at surgical resection.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
