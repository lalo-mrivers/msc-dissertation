["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents describe various aspects of Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD), including its inheritance pattern, clinical features, and treatment options. However, they do not provide direct information on functional tests as biomarkers for the condition. The laboratory findings mentioned in 'Muscular dystrophy in young girls' include high serum creatine kinase levels, myopathic E.M.G. appearances, and muscle biopsies, which are useful diagnostic tools but not functional tests specifically. Therefore, based on the provided documents, it is unclear whether functional tests can be considered good biomarkers for DMD.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B: no\"\n}"]
