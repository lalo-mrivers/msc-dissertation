["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents suggest that radiation for tinea capitis can increase brain tumor risk. In the first document, a case is reported of a 39-year-old male who developed primary brain lymphoma 33 years after receiving scalp irradiation for tinea capitis. This suggests an association between cranial irradiation during childhood and subsequent development of primary brain lymphoma. The second document estimates the dose to various head structures in children given X-ray therapy for tinea capitis, including the thyroid, pituitary gland, and brain. It also notes a linear dose-response relationship within the first 30-40 years after exposure with a risk of about 0-04% per rad. The third document highlights the importance of cultures in diagnosing nonfluorescent tinea capitis, which is now the preponderant agent. Finally, the fourth document discusses the oncogenic hazards of radiotherapy to the brain, including the development of meningioma and astrocytomas in patients who received radiation therapy for primary brain tumors. This suggests that moderate doses of ionising radiations given in childhood for tinea capitis are associated with a late risk of developing a meningioma.\",\n\"answer_choice\": A"]
