["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks if cytokeratin is a tumor marker. We need to look at the provided documents for evidence of its use as a tumor marker. In document 1, it is mentioned that [1-11C]putrescine was not well incorporated into poorly enhancing lesions, regardless of their pathology, emphasizing the requirement of a disrupted blood-brain barrier for 11C-putrescine uptake. This does not provide evidence for or against cytokeratin as a tumor marker. In document 2, it is mentioned that in cutaneous merkeliomatosis, we investigated the immunohistochemical expression of cytokeratin in cutaneous tumors, making use of 3 monoclonal antibodies. This suggests that cytokeratin may be used to detect tumor cells. In document 3, it is mentioned that forty-six smooth muscle tumors were studied immunohistochemically for the localization of cytokeratin using a variety of monoclonal antibodies. Six of 40 leiomyomas, two of five leiomyosarcomas and one leiomyoblastoma were immunoreactive for cytokeratin in a few tumor cells. This suggests that cytokeratin may be used to detect certain types of tumors. In document 4, it is mentioned that the chondroid hidradenoma was studied immunohistologically and the expression of cytokeratin and calmodulin were detected. Tumor cells with immunoreactive calmodulin were found predominantly in the centre of adenoid structures, whereas cells expressing cytokeratin were preferable located as the margins. This suggests that cytokeratin may be used to detect specific types of tumor cells. Finally, document 5 discusses the co-ordinate expression of c-fos, p53 and cytokeratin genes during the alteration of growth of human hepatoma cells. mRNA levels measured by reverse transcription and polymerase chain reaction. Teleocidin transiently increased the levels of c-fos and p53 mRNAs measured by reverse transcription and polymerase chain reaction. This was followed by a reduction of c-myc mRNA and an increase of cytokeratin mRNA. The level of p120 mRNA was not remarkably altered. Sequential alterations of the expression of c-fos, p53, c-myc and cytokeratin genes induced by teleocidin may be responsible for the morphological and functional changes of hepatoma cells induced by this tumor promoter. This suggests that cytokeratin may be used to detect specific types of tumors.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A: yes\""]
