["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the expression of common fragile sites on the X chromosome, which corresponds with active gene regions. The documents also discuss X chromosome inactivation in mammals, including the fact that pseudoautosomal genes, such as steroid sulfatase, escape inactivation in both female and male germ cells. Arylsulfatase C is mentioned to be a microsomal membrane-bound enzyme that consists of two biochemically distinct isozymes (s and f), with only the s form having steroid sulfatase activity. The f form also escapes from X inactivation, suggesting that it may be a pseudoautosomal gene. CXorf21 is not explicitly mentioned in any of the documents; however, based on the information provided, it can be inferred that CXorf21 might be a gene that escapes X chromosome inactivation.\",\n\"answer_choice\": A"]
