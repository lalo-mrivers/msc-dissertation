["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, there is no direct information about circRNAs or their susceptibility to degradation by RNase R. However, we can infer that RNase A has a specific activity for tRNA, whereas angiogenin, a member of the RNase A superfamily, also exhibits specificity towards tRNA. One of the homologues in this family, eosinophil-derived neurotoxin, lacks this specificity and is cytotoxic at low concentrations.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
