["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks if bleomycin causes lung toxicity. The first document suggests that bleomycin can cause lung fibrosis by restraining collagenase activity. The second document shows that combination chemotherapy including bleomycin can lead to serious pulmonary toxicity, and six patients died from irreversible respiratory failure. The third document states that intracavitary administration of bleomycin does not cause abnormal changes in the lung parenchyma but may cause pleural thickening. The fourth document confirms that bleomycin can cause strand breaks in hamster lung DNA in vivo. These findings collectively suggest that bleomycin can indeed cause lung toxicity.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
