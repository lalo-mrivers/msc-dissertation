["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about using whole genome sequencing for diagnosis of mitochondrial disease. The documents provided reveal that the nuclear gene coding for the mitochondrial subunit 9 of the F0F1-ATP synthase complex was isolated from a genomic library of Podospora anserina, and this gene appears to be exclusively encoded by the nuclear genome. Additionally, the document on sequencing of PCR-amplified DNA highlights the importance of template purity and concentration in determining the efficiency and reliability of nucleotide sequencing methods. The other documents discuss various aspects of mitochondrial DNA, such as its structure and the presence of tRNA genes. However, none of these documents suggest that whole genome sequencing can be used for diagnosis of mitochondrial disease.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B: no\""]
