["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking if leuprorelin acetate can be used as androgen deprivation therapy. From the provided documents, it seems that leuprorelin acetate is a gonadotrophin-releasing hormone agonist that induces reversible hypo-oestrogenism. In the premenopausal study, serum levels of gonadotrophins and oestrogens were suppressed markedly by both doses of leuprorelin acetate. In the postmenopausal study, major suppression of serum gonadotrophins to below 10% of pretreatment values was observed. These results suggest that leuprorelin acetate may be used as androgen deprivation therapy.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
