["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about whether losartan can reduce brain atrophy in Alzheimer's disease. The provided documents don't mention losartan or its effect on brain atrophy. However, one document discusses the topographic distribution of brain atrophy in Alzheimer's disease and suggests that cerebral cortical atrophy is probably due mostly to neurofibrillary degeneration and loss of intrinsic pyramidal cells and their processes (grey matter) and axons (white matter). Another document mentions that defects in cholinergic neurotransmission do not, by themselves, constitute the sole pathophysiologic concomitants of Alzheimer's disease. Recent findings point out that abnormalities in membrane phospholipid turnover and in brain energy metabolism may also characterize AD.\n\nThere is no evidence in the provided documents to suggest that losartan can reduce brain atrophy in Alzheimer's disease.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
