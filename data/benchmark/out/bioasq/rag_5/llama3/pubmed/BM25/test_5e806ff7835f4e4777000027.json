["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the expression of ACE2 on cell surfaces. According to the document 'Parallel pathways of gene regulation', it states that ACE2 shows patterns of cell cycle-regulated transcription and nuclear localization similar to those seen previously for SWI5. This suggests that ACE2 is also a transcriptional activator like SWI5. However, there is no information provided about the expression of ACE2 on cell surfaces.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B: no\"\n}"]
