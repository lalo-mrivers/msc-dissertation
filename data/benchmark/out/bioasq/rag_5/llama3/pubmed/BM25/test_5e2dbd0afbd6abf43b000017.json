["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking whether pimavanserin is a typical antipsychotic. Pimavanserin is an antagonist of serotonin receptors 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A, which are involved in the regulation of inward currents (Is) in cardiac Purkinje fibers. The provided documents do not mention pimavanserin directly, but they discuss the relationship between inward currents (Is) and contraction in cardiac muscle and Purkinje fibers. Isradipine is a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker that may replenish or augment an intracellular calcium pool via this current. Since pimavanserin is not mentioned, we cannot directly determine whether it is a typical antipsychotic based on the provided information.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B: no\"\n}"]
