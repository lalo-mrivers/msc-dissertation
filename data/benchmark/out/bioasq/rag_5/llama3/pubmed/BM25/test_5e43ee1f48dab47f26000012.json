["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking whether circular exons increase gene expression. The provided documents describe circular exons as a result of splicing and their properties, but there's no direct evidence of increased gene expression. Since the context doesn't mention any mechanisms that would suggest an increase in gene expression due to circular exons, it's more likely that the answer is based on other factors.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
