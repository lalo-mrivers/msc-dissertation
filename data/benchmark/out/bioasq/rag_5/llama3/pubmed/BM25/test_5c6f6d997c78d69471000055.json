["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about pimavanserin's effectiveness for Parkinson's disease psychosis. We are looking for information on psychotic markers or neurotransmitters involved in psychosis. The relevant documents mention plasma serine concentrations as a potential marker, but the study found no difference between schizophrenics and controls. Antidiuretic hormone (ADH) was found to be elevated in acutely psychotic subjects. Since Parkinson's disease is mentioned separately, we should consider the possibility of PD-related psychosis. There is no direct information on pimavanserin, so let's focus on ADH as a potential marker for psychosis.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
