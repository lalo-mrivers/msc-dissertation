["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The study on Increased methylation of the c-fms protooncogene in acute myelomonocytic leukemias discusses DNA methylation as an epigenetic modification possibly involved in differentiation processes and gene regulation. The requirement of S-adenosyl-L-methionine-mediated methylation for human monocyte chemotaxis suggests that adenosine methylation is indeed a form of epigenetic modification. Additionally, the characterization of 5'-terminal methylation of human alpha- and beta-globin mRNAs shows that adenosine methylation is part of the cap structure at the 5' end of mRNA, which can affect gene expression without changing the underlying DNA sequence.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
