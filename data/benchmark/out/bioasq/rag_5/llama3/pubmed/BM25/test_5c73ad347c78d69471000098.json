["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the survival of Pancreatic Cancer patients. The relevant documents are the ones about pancreatic cancer. In the first document, it's mentioned that overall and stage-stratified relative survival rates declined with advancing patient age for cancer of the pancreas. This suggests that older patients have a lower chance of survival from pancreatic cancer. In the second document, it's stated that among 11,317 patients registered in the Pancreatic Cancer Registry, only 3,743 cases (33.1%) underwent resectional procedures and had an actual 5-year survival rate of 16.6%. This indicates that the survival rate for pancreatic cancer is relatively low.\n\nThe third document provides information on treatment options and present status of pancreatic cancer, but it doesn't directly address whether axitinib prolongs survival or not. The fourth document discusses C-reactive protein modulating T-lymphocyte function in methotrexate-treated rheumatoid arthritis patients, which isn't relevant to the question.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the information provided about pancreatic cancer, it's unlikely that axitinib would prolong survival of Pancreatic Cancer patients.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
