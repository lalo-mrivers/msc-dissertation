["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking whether genes with monoallelic expression (where one allele is expressed and the other is silent or has a different function) contribute proportionally to genetic diversity in humans. The provided documents discuss gene expression, genetic diversity, and molecular biology of various genes. However, there is no direct information that specifically addresses this question.\n\nTo answer the question, we need to consider the mechanisms that generate genetic diversity, which are discussed in the documents. Spontaneous mutations, alternative splicing, and differential expression can all contribute to genetic diversity. However, these mechanisms do not necessarily involve monoallelic expression.\n\nThe document on molecular biology of P-glycoprotein discusses spontaneous mutations and alternative splicing as means to generate diversity in multidrug-resistance phenotype associated with P-glycoprotein expression. The document on DNA recombination and natural selection pressure sustain genetic sequence diversity of the feline MHC class I genes provides evidence for four coordinate factors that contribute to the origin and sustenance of abundant allele diversity, but it does not specifically discuss monoallelic expression.\n\nThe documents on gene expression, cellular diversification and tumor progression to the metastatic phenotype and Genetic diversity in hemoglobins. Disease and nondisease provide general information on gene expression and genetic diversity, but do not directly address the question.\n\nBased on this analysis, we cannot conclude that genes with monoallelic expression contribute proportionally to genetic diversity in humans because there is no direct evidence or specific discussion of this mechanism in the provided documents.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
