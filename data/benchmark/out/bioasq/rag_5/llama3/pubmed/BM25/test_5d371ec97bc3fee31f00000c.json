["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking if CTCF is bound at nucleosome free regions. From the provided documents, it can be seen that the MMTV promoter is depleted of histone H1 and hormone activation results in reduced H1 content with little or no change in H2B. This suggests that there may be regions without histone H1. However, none of the documents specifically mention CTCF binding to such regions. Therefore, we cannot definitively say if CTCF is bound at nucleosome free regions.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
