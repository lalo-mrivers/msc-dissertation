["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the provided documents, we can see that enhancers do not have to be close to their gene targets. In the DNA position-specific repression of transcription by a Drosophila zinc finger protein study, it is shown that the su(Hw)-binding region of gypsy inserted at different positions in the y gene gives rise to phenotypes that can be rationalized assuming that the presence of the su(Hw) protein inhibits the action of those tissue-specific enhancers that are located more distally from the su(Hw)-binding region with respect to the promoter. This suggests that enhancers do not have to be close to their gene targets, but rather can act over long distances. Additionally, in the Regulation of hepatitis B virus gene expression by its two enhancers study, it is shown that either of the two HBV enhancers can activate all three major HBV promoters in several human hepatoma lines, suggesting that enhancers do not have to be close to their target genes to exert their effects.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
