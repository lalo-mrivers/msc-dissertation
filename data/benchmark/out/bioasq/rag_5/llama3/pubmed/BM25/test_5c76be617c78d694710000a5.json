["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Birdshot retinochoroidopathy is strongly associated with HLA-A29. We reviewed the HLA typings of 58 white French patients who had birdshot retinochoroidopathy and found that all patients (100%) had HLA-A29.2 subtype. This suggests a strong correlation between HLA-A29.2 and the disease. Therefore, we can conclude that ERAP2 is not directly associated with the disease since there are no documents mentioning its involvement or relation to birdshot retinochoroidopathy.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
