["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe studies on olive pollen allergens, including ELISAs, immunoblotting, and HPLC separation. The study on heterogeneity of a major allergen from olive (Olea europea) pollen shows that the sera from 88% of patients who were sensitive to olive pollen contained IgE that reacted with a 19,000 Mr component and many also reacted to a 17,000 Mr band as shown by SDS-PAGE immunoblotting. This suggests that the proteome of olive tree pollen has been studied.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
