["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents don't directly address the concept of an upper limit on the functional fraction of the human genome. However, we can draw parallels from studies on age-structured populations and seasonal fluctuations of food intake in dormice. Both examples demonstrate oscillations or cycles with upper and lower limits. Similarly, the concept of an upper limit on the functional fraction of the human genome is plausible, considering the complexity of genetic interactions. The Maximal oxygen uptake study suggests that there may be an upper limit for oxygen transport, which could be analogous to an upper limit on the functional fraction of the human genome.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
