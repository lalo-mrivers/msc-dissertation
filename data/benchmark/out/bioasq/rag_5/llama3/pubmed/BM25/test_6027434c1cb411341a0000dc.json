["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The provided documents mention gabapentin as an antiepileptic drug that has been studied for its effectiveness in treating partial epilepsy. However, there is no direct evidence or information about the use of gabapentin specifically for chronic pelvic pain. The document on stability studies of gabapentin shows that the degradation rate was minimum at a pH of 6.0, but this study does not relate to the treatment of chronic pelvic pain. Long-term treatment with gabapentin for partial epilepsy suggests that some patients can be maintained on gabapentin alone, but again, this is not related to the specific condition of chronic pelvic pain. Pelvic inflammatory disease is a different topic altogether. Electric pelvic floor stimulation is unrelated to the use of gabapentin for chronic pelvic pain.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
