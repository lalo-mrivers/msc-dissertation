["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks whether g-H2AX is a marker for double strand breaks. The relevant documents discuss DNA double-strand breaks as lesions relevant for cell killing by ionizing radiation. Molecular assays of radiation-induced DNA damage mention that DNA double-stranded breaks are the most significant lesion, and new assays can assess the distribution of dsb in different parts of the genome. The repair of double-strand breaks in chromosomal DNA of yeast also discusses the induction and repair of double-strand breaks by ionizing radiation. The Localization of gamma-rays induced chromatid breaks using a three consecutive staining technique does not directly relate to this question, but it shows that the majority of breakage points occur at interbands, which may be relevant for understanding double-strand breaks. Therefore, based on the information provided, g-H2AX is likely a marker for double strand breaks.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
