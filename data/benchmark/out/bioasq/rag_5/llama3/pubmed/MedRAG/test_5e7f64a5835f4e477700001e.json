["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"There is no mention of CMB305 in the provided documents. However, we can analyze the information regarding immunotherapy and its effects on sarcomas. Immunotherapy using BCG and tumor cell vaccine has shown promising results in localized soft tissue sarcoma, with 11 out of 18 patients remaining free of disease. Similarly, inhibitory effects of xenogeneic antiserum on the growth of Moloney virus-induced sarcomas have been observed. These findings suggest that immunotherapy can be effective against sarcomas. Since CMB305 is not explicitly mentioned, we cannot conclusively say whether it can be used against sarcomas or not. However, based on the information provided, it is reasonable to infer that CMB305 could potentially be useful in treating sarcomas.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
