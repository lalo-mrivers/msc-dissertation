["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"There is no mention of CXorf21 in any of the provided documents. The documents primarily discuss the isolation of human genes that escape X inactivation, expression of common fragile sites on the X chromosome, mammalian X-chromosome inactivation and the XIST gene, and X inactivation in mammalian testis. As there is no direct mention of CXorf21, we must rely on indirect information. Two genes (XE7 and XE59) were identified as newly cloned sequences that contain genes expressed from an inactive X chromosome. XE7 was characterized as a pseudoautosomal gene. The documents do not provide information about the status of CXorf21 with regards to X chromosome inactivation. Therefore, we cannot make any definitive conclusions.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B: no\""]
