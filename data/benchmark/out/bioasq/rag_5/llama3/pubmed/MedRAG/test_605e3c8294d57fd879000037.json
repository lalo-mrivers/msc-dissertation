["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks if atenolol is metabolized by CYP2D6. We need to find information about atenolol's metabolism. There are several documents provided. The first document discusses different human cytochrome P450 forms, including CYP2D6. It mentions that this enzyme shows polymorphism and has substrate specificity well established. This suggests that CYP2D6 is involved in the metabolism of certain drugs. However, it does not specifically mention atenolol. The second document discusses clinical implications of competitive inhibition by quinidine, but again does not mention atenolol. The third document provides an overview of human cytochrome P450 enzymes and their properties, but this information is general and does not provide specific details about atenolol's metabolism. The fourth document discusses characterization of human cytochrome P450 enzymes and the individual variation in drug metabolism due to genetic factors. It mentions PCR amplification for predicting patient drug metabolism capacity, which could be relevant if we knew atenolol was metabolized by CYP2D6. However, no information about atenolol is provided in this document either. The final document investigates plasma clearance of propranolol and sotalol but does not mention atenolol. Based on the information available, there is no direct evidence to suggest that atenolol is metabolized by CYP2D6.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B\n}"]
