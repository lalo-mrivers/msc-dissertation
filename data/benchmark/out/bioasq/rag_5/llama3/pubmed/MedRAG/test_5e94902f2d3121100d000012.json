["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Non-lysosomal cytoplasmic degradation is mentioned as a process that takes place in regions where cytoplasmic components are trapped and not accessible to primary and secondary lysosomes. The concept of non-lysosomal degradation permits dynamic interpretation of various inclusions as the concept of focal cytoplasmic degradation (autophagy) leads to dynamic interpretation of the lysosome. Autophagy is mentioned as a process where cells 'eat' their own structural components by autophagy. This information suggests that aggrephagy might be a variant of autophagy.\",\n\"answer_choice\": A"]
