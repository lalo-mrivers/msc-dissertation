["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The concept of transcriptional enhancers is that they increase the activity of a promoter. In the provided documents, there are examples of enhancers that work with different promoters (e.g., Jun-Fos heterodimers on different Ap-1 target sites). However, one document mentions repression by Jun of the Polyoma-virus enhancer overrides activation in a cell-specific manner. This suggests that there may be instances where an enhancer can actually decrease the activity of a promoter.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
