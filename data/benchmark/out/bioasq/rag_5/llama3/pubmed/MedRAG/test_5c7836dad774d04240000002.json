["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) as dividing into progeny that become committed to a specific phenotypic pathway, leading to the formation of unique tissue types such as cartilage or bone. This process involves local cuing and genomic potential interacting at each lineage step to control cell rate and phenotype. The study of MSC provides the basis for self-cell repair technology. In the context of this information, it can be inferred that MSC are multipotent cells.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
