["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Comparing the effects of metformin on atherosclerosis from multiple studies. In the pilot study, metformin improved insulin sensitivity, decreased plasma insulin, serum cholesterol, and triglycerides, and increased fibrinolytic activity, which suggests it may help alleviate atherosclerosis. Additionally, in the comparative effects study, only metformin prevented the development of aortic and coronary lesions in cholesterol-fed rabbits. In the plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 study, metformin reduced basal and post-venous occlusion PAI-1Ag concentrations, which may also contribute to alleviating atherosclerosis. Therefore, based on these studies, it seems that metformin may have therapeutic effects on atherosclerosis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
