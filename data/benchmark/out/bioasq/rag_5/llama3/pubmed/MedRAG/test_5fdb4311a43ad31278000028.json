["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about enhancers' targeting of gene promoters. The given documents discuss various aspects of transcription regulation, including TATA and initiator elements, promoter regions, and DNA looping. However, there is no direct mention of enhancers or their directionality in the provided texts. Hence, we need to focus on general principles of transcription regulation. Enhancers are typically considered as positive regulatory elements that can interact with promoters to enhance gene expression. From this perspective, enhancers may not necessarily have a directional preference for targeting specific promoters. Therefore, based on our analysis, it is reasonable to conclude that enhancers might not be directional in their targeting of gene promoters.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
