["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to the documents, astrocytes play a crucial role in the formation and maintenance of the blood-brain barrier. In 'Development of the blood-brain barrier', it is mentioned that astrocytes tightly appose endfeet onto the abluminal side of brain capillaries, which seem to be important for the induction and maintenance of the endothelial barrier. Furthermore, in 'Astrocyte-endothelial interaction: physiology and pathology', it is stated that perivascular astrocytic end feet cooperate with endothelial cells in forming and maintaining the blood-brain barrier. Therefore, based on this evidence, it can be concluded that astrocytes are part of the blood-brain barrier.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
