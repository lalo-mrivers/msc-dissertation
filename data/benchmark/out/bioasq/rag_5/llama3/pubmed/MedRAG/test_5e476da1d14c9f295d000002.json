["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about marimastat's effectiveness for small-cell lung cancer. Marimastat is an inhibitor of cell surface proteases. In one of the provided documents, we see that a cytoplasmic protein inhibitor extracted from lung tumour cells can inhibit a cell surface protease. This suggests that marimastat may be effective in inhibiting this protease on small-cell lung cancer cells. However, another document discusses phase II evaluation of menogaril (NSC-269148) in non-small cell lung carcinoma, but it does not mention marimastat or its effectiveness for small-cell lung cancer.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
