["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks if metoprolol is metabolized by CYP2D6. We can infer that propranolol is also a beta-blocker, but the passage does not mention its metabolism being related to CYP2D6. However, it mentions the effects of metoprolol on cytochrome P-450 and cytochrome b5, which suggests that metoprolol may be metabolized by CYP2D6. Additionally, the comparison of metoprolol with propranolol shows that metoprolol has a greater impact on the metabolism of certain enzymes, which further supports the idea that metoprolol is metabolized by CYP2D6.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
