["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking whether stretch enhancers are transcribed more than super-enhancers. None of the provided documents explicitly compare transcription levels between stretch enhancers and super-enhancers. However, we can infer from the information provided that the TATA-less promoter in the human genomic region containing the coding sequence of SSAT starts 179 bases upstream from the translational start site. This suggests that the transcriptional activation process may involve a loop structure as described in the 'Chromatin loops and transcriptional regulation' document, which could be influenced by topoisomerase activity. Furthermore, the 'DNA intervention in transcriptional activation' document highlights the importance of even those portions of the promoter stretch which do not have any identifiable binding sites for regulatory proteins, including intervening DNA that may interfere with the level of transcriptional activation. Therefore, it is unlikely that stretch enhancers are transcribed more than super-enhancers.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
