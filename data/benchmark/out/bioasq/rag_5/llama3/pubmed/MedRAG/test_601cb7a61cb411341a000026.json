["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Panitumumab is an anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody (mAb). It targets the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) which is a tyrosine kinase receptor family member. The relevant documents do not mention trichomegaly as a known side effect or complication of Panitumumab treatment.
