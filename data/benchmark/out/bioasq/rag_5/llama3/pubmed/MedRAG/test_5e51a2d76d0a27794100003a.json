["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks whether genes with monoallelic expression contribute proportionally to genetic diversity in humans. From the provided documents, we can see that the H19 gene is monoallelically expressed in humans, and this phenomenon has been observed in mice as well. Monoallelic expression of several genes has been observed in mice, but not in humans until now. This suggests that monoallelic expression might be a common mechanism for gene regulation in humans. However, the study on the displacement of single-locus polymorphisms does not directly address this question. The analysis of genetic variation in Nigeria also does not provide direct evidence to answer this question. Finally, the concept of multilocus enzymes is unrelated to monoallelic expression and therefore cannot be used to answer this question.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
