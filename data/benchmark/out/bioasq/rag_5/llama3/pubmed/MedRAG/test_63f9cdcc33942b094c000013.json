["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about silencing of SRRM4 inhibiting tumor growth across cancers. The provided documents discuss negative regulators of cell growth, including tumor suppressor genes that when lost can lead to cancerous growth. This suggests that inactivating or 'silencing' a tumor suppressor gene could promote tumor growth. The documents also mention the importance of tumor-suppressor genes in the development and growth control of tumors. There is no specific information about SRRM4, but based on the general principles discussed, it can be inferred that silencing a tumor suppressor gene like SRRM4 would likely promote tumor growth.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
