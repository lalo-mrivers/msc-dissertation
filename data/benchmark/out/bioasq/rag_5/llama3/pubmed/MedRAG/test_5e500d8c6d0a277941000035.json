["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking if αCGRP (alpha-CGRP) is a member of the CGRP family. According to the documents, αCGRP is mentioned as part of the calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) family in the first and third documents. Specifically, it says that 'alpha CGRP' shows diversity both in its effects and its receptors, and it has multiple roles including neurotransmitter, neuromodulator, local hormone, and trophic factor. Additionally, inhibition by calcitonin gene-related peptide of agonist-induced bronchoconstriction in various mammals including man also includes αCGRP as part of the CGRP family. Therefore, based on these documents, it can be concluded that αCGRP is a member of the CGRP family.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
