["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about Nanog repression in pluripotent stem cells. From the provided documents, we can see that Oct-4 is a transcription factor expressed in pluripotent progenitor cells of the early mouse embryo (A nexus between Oct-4 and E1A: implications for gene regulation in embryonic stem cells). This suggests that Oct-4 is active in pluripotent stem cells. Nanog, on the other hand, is not explicitly mentioned in the provided documents. However, we can infer from the model presented in Irreversible gene repression model for control of development that previously active genes become irreversibly restricted to expression of a single phenotype as differentiation progresses. This implies that Oct-4 and potentially other transcription factors like Nanog might be repressed as pluripotent stem cells differentiate.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
