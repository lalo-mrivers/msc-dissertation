["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking if losartan can reduce brain atrophy in Alzheimer's disease. Losartan is an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. ACE density was found to be increased in temporal cortex from patients with Alzheimer's disease. Additionally, the article suggests that targeting compounds which interact with the central angiotensin system as novel therapies for cognitive dysfunction. This provides support for the idea that altering the rate of progression of Alzheimer's disease can be achieved by targeting the central angiotensin system. Since losartan is an ACE inhibitor, it seems likely that it could potentially reduce brain atrophy in Alzheimer's disease.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
