["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks whether whole genome sequencing can be used for diagnosis of mitochondrial disease. The relevant documents describe the structure and function of mitochondrial DNA, its mutations and how they relate to human diseases. Mitochondrial diseases are caused by defects in the mitochondrial DNA sequence. Therefore, it is possible to predict the consequences of changes in mitochondrial DNA sequence. This information suggests that whole genome sequencing could be used for diagnosis of mitochondrial disease.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
