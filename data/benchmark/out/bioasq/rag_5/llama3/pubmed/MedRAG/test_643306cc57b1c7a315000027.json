["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the provided documents, it is clear that EGFR (Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor) gene alterations are associated with various types of cancers. The documents mention that EGFR is expressed by NSCLC cells and that specific inhibition of K-ras oncogene expression reduces the growth rate and tumorigenicity of NSCLC cells. Additionally, structural alterations of the EGFR gene have been characterized in human gliomas. However, there is no direct information provided about CRISPR/Cas12a technology for detecting EGFR mutations in circulating DNA. Therefore, based on the available information, it can be concluded that CRISPR/Cas12a cannot be used directly for the detection of EGFR mutations in circulating DNA.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
