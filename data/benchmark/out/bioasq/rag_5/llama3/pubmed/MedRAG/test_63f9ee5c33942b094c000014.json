["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking if SRRM4 regulates neuronal-specific microexon splicing of TAF1 mRNA. There is no information provided about SRRM4 or its role in regulating splicing of TAF1 mRNA. The given documents discuss general splicing factors SF2 and SC35, RNA processing, and the primary structure of the human splicing factor ASF. None of these documents mention SRRM4 or its involvement in microexon splicing. Therefore, based on the information provided, it is not possible to determine if SRRM4 regulates neuronal-specific microexon splicing of TAF1 mRNA.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
