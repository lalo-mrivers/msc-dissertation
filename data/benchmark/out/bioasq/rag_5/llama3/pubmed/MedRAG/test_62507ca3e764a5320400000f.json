["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"After reviewing the provided documents, I did not find any information specifically mentioning SOX10 expression in melanoma cells. However, I did come across a mention of antigens expressed by melanoma cells in the first document, which does not include SOX10. The second and third documents discuss cytogenetic analysis and human malignant melanoma cell lines, but do not mention SOX10 either. The fourth document describes a rare case of primary cutaneous myxoid melanoma, but again does not mention SOX10 expression. Therefore, based on the available information, I concluded that there is no evidence to suggest that SOX10 is expressed in melanoma cells.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
