["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents suggest that the optimal time for intervention is the hour immediately following brain ischemia. Experimental data also imply that the delay between onset of stroke symptoms and initiation of treatment may be too late to rescue ischemic neurons, requiring early treatment initiation. There is no specific drug therapy proven to be beneficial in controlled trials, but new drugs like nerinetide are being studied. Naftidrofuryl has been shown to improve neurological progress and reduce hospital stay time for patients with acute stroke. Considering the biologic basis of stroke treatment, the importance of early intervention, and the lack of proven effective treatments, it is unclear whether nerinetide should be used for treatment of ischaemic stroke.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
