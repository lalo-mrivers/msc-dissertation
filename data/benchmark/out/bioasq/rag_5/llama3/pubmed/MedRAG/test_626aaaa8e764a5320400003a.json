["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Epigenetic modifications refer to changes in gene expression that occur without a change in the DNA sequence. The documents highlight that epigenetic inheritance from parental germlines confers functional differences on parental chromosomes. This suggests that epigenetic modifications can be heritable, as they are influenced by the differences in epigenetic inheritance from parental germlines. Additionally, the articles discuss how epigenetic modifications of unlinked loci can result in substantial phenotypic variations, indicating that these changes can be passed on to subsequent generations.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
