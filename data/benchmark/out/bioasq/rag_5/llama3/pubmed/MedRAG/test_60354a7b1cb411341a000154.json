["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking if honey contains diastases/amylases. We have documents that discuss amylase activity in different contexts. In the first document, it talks about separating amylase from other activities using hydrophobic affinity chromatography on phenyl-butylamine-Sepharose 4B. This suggests that honey contains amylase-like enzymes with hydrophobic properties. In the second and third documents, there is no specific mention of honey or its contents. However, the fourth document discusses amylase levels in body fluids, including saliva, which is a component of honey. Based on this information, it can be concluded that yes, honey contains diastases/amylases.\",\n\"answer_choice\": A"]
