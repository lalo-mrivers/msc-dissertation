["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is whether salivary cortisol can be used to evaluate pain in neonates. The relevant documents suggest that salivary cortisol levels were compared between noncocaine-exposed and cocaine-exposed infants under three conditions: Basal, Noninvasive Stressor, and Invasive Stressor.

Therefore, based on the provided information, it is unlikely that salivary cortisol can be used to evaluate pain in neonates.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
