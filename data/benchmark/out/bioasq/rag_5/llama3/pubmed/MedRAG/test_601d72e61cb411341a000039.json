["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe progeria as a rare autosomal recessive disease. The analysis of biochemical evolution suggests that the regulation of enzyme levels may underlie most evolutionary changes. Progeria is characterized by premature aging and has been linked to hyaluronuria, which is an increase in hyaluronic acid excretion. Werner's syndrome, another premature aging disorder, is also genetically linked to markers on chromosome 8. Given the autosomal recessive nature of both progeria and Werner's syndrome, it is likely that progeria is caused by an autosomal recessive gene.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
