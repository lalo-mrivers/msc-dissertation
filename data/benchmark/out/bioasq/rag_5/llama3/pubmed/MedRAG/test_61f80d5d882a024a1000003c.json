["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking whether changes only in the coding regions of MEF2C cause developmental disorders. We can look at the relevant documents to answer this. The first document talks about MEF2 proteins and their role in muscle-specific transcription. It mentions that all share a conserved amino-terminal DNA-binding domain, including the MADS homology. This suggests that changes in the coding regions of MEF2C could potentially affect its function. However, it also mentions that post-transcriptional regulation is important for tissue-specific MEF2 activity, which implies that changes outside the coding regions could also impact developmental disorders. The second document talks about regulatory genes and gene sequences involved in pattern formation and positional information. This does not specifically mention MEF2C or its role in developmental disorders. The third document discusses minor chromosome variants and their association with congenital abnormalities and mental disorders, but it does not provide any information about changes in coding regions of MEF2C or its relationship to developmental disorders. Overall, the documents suggest that both changes in the coding regions and non-coding regions of MEF2C could potentially affect its function and contribute to developmental disorders.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
