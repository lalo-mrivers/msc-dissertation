["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Cathepsin L is an inactive zymogen that undergoes autolysis at pH 3.0 to give mature forms of the enzyme. It can also be activated at pH 5.5 in the presence of negatively charged surfaces, but no activation occurs at pH 6.5 or higher. Since endosomes have a slightly different pH environment compared to lysosomes, we need to look for information about cathepsin L's activity under acidic conditions. According to one document, cathepsin L is an endopeptidase that shows mainly exopeptidase and only low endopeptidase activity. This suggests that it might be active in a specific environment with a certain pH.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
