["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents provide information on breast-feeding experiences of women with type I diabetes, the relationship between breast-feeding and development of type 1 diabetes mellitus, risk determinants for early-onset type 1 diabetes mellitus independent of islet cell antibodies and early introduction of cow's milk, and prevention or delay of type 1 (insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus in children using nicotinamide.

The study on breast-feeding experience of women with type I diabetes found no differences in clinical characteristics between diabetic subjects and controls. Another study found no association between duration of breast-feeding and subsequent risk of developing type 1 diabetes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
