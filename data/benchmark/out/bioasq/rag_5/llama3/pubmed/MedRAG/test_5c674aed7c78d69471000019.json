["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about raspberries improving postprandial glucose and acute/chronic inflammation in adults with type 2 diabetes. We need to look at the provided documents for relevant information. The first document discusses unabsorbable carbohydrates and their effect on blood-glucose levels, but it doesn't mention raspberries or type 2 diabetes. The second document investigates chronic hyperglycaemia's impact on islet B-cell responsiveness in newly diagnosed type 2 diabetics. There's no connection to raspberries here either. The third document examines the effects of psyllium fiber on postprandial glucose and insulin levels in patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes. This study suggests that fiber can reduce postprandial glucose elevation, but it doesn't discuss type 2 diabetes specifically or the involvement of raspberries. The fourth document discusses long-term complications in diabetics and the potential benefits of combination therapy with acarbose, an alpha-glucosidase inhibitor. There's no mention of raspberries here either.\n\nLet's summarize what we've found so far: none of the provided documents discuss raspberries improving postprandial glucose or acute/chronic inflammation in adults with type 2 diabetes. Therefore, we should choose...\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
