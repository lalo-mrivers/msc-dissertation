["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents indicate that tranexamic acid is not effective for subarachnoid hemorrhage. The studies suggest that there are no differences in re-bleeds, morbidity or mortality between the tranexamic and placebo-treated groups. Similarly, another study found that tranexamic acid did not favorably affect the outcome. Another study concluded that antifibrinolytic therapy provides beneficial treatment to patients with recent onset subarachnoid hemorrhage, but this is not directly related to intracerebral haemorrhage.
