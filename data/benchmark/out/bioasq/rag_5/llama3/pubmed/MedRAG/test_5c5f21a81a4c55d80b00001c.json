["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Selenoprotein synthesis involves the incorporation of selenocysteine into proteins co-translationally. Selenocysteine is incorporated into these proteins because of its high chemical reactivity and is directed by a UGA codon in the mRNA. The relevant documents state that selenocysteine biosynthesis occurs on a specific tRNA and insertion into a growing polypeptide is directed by a UGA codon in the mRNA.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
