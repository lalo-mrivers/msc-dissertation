["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"FTY720 is an experimental therapeutic agent mentioned in 'Experimental therapies for multiple sclerosis: current status' which reviews the results of clinical trials of experimental therapeutic agents in multiple sclerosis. The document does not explicitly state FDA approval or disapproval, so we need to look further. In 'New approaches to the therapy of demyelinating disease', there is no mention of FTY720. However, in 'Expanding access to investigational new therapies' and 'The role of the FDA in new drug development and availability', there are no specific mentions of FTY720 either. The final document 'Investigational drugs and research' does not provide information about FDA approval or disapproval for any particular agent, including FTY720. Therefore, we need to rely on external knowledge that FTY720 is a marketed product under the brand name ZEPATIER, which is used to treat patients with partial seizures associated with epilepsy.\", \n\"answer_choice\": \"B: no\""]
