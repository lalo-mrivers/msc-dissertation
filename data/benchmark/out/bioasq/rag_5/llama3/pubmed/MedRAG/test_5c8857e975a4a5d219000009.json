["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Both 'Therapy for Alzheimer's disease: choosing a target' and 'Clinical issues of cognitive enhancers in Alzheimer disease' discuss the development of treatments for Alzheimer's disease. None of these articles specifically mention apoE mimetics as a treatment. However, 'Brain amyloid in Alzheimer's disease--a new experimental model' discusses transgenic mice models for studying Alzheimer's disease. While this article does not directly address apoE mimetics, it is mentioned in the 'Amyloidogenesis in Alzheimer's disease: basic biology and animal models' paper as being a hypothetical mechanism to reproduce Alzheimer's disease-specific pathology in rodents. Given that apoE has been shown to play a role in amyloidosis and clearance of beta-amyloid peptides, it is possible that apoE mimetics are being considered as a treatment against Alzheimer's disease. Therefore, based on the available information, it can be inferred that yes, apoE mimetics are being considered as a treatment.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
