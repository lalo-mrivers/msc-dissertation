["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, we can infer that GRG5 is not mentioned explicitly. However, G-Hox 7 is a homeobox-containing gene described in the paper 'Repeating developmental expression of G-Hox 7, a novel homeobox-containing gene in the chicken.' This gene is expressed widely during chick development and may play an essential role at multiple sites. Although GRG5 is not mentioned, its relation to G-Hox 7 can be inferred. Since G-Hox 7's expression is widespread throughout development, it is likely that GRG5 also has a broader role in development, rather than being limited to late development.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B: no\""]
