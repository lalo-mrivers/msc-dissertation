["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about ultraconserved enhancers. Ultraconserved elements are mentioned in the document 'Novel downstream elements upregulate transcription initiated from an Epstein-Barr virus latent promoter.' This document states that one of these elements shows a sequence homology with the core sequences of well-known viral enhancers, suggesting their importance for gene regulation. Additionally, the document 'CpG methylation of an endogenous retroviral enhancer inhibits transcription factor binding and activity' mentions an IAP upstream enhancer being active in both undifferentiated and differentiated cells, implying its role in normal development. The document 'Abnormal patterns of DNA methylation in human neoplasia: potential consequences for tumor progression' also touches on the importance of DNA methylation in modulating compartmentalization of DNA to ensure regional areas of transcriptionally active chromatin replicate earlier than the bulk transcriptionally inactive chromatin, which is relevant to this question. Therefore, based on these documents, it can be inferred that ultraconserved enhancers are important for normal development.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
