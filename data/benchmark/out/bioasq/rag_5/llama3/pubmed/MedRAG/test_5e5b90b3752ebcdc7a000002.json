["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks whether brain-derived exosomes can carry APP molecules. From the provided documents, we know that APP is a protein precursor that can be cleaved to produce various soluble derivatives, including A beta, which deposits as amyloid in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease. We also know that some of these derivatives are nonamyloidogenic and end at position 15 of the A beta, while others may contain the entire A beta. The documents do not explicitly mention exosomes or APP molecules being transported through exosomes. However, we can infer that brain-derived exosomes could potentially carry APP molecules based on the information provided.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
