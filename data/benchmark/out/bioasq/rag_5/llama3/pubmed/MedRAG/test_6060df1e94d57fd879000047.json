["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking if there's an upper limit on the functional fraction of the human genome. Based on the study of DNA sequence variation, we know that regions showing high evolutionary stability are often conserved as a result of functional constraints. This suggests that certain parts of the genome have functional importance. However, the presence of highly polymorphic markers in human gene mapping also implies that there's significant variation within the genome. Considering these points, it seems that there might not be an upper limit on the functional fraction of the human genome.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B: no\"\n}"]
