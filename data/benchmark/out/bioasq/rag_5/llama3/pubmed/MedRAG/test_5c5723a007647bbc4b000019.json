["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"There is no mention of yeast prions or human amyloid diseases in the provided documents. The documents primarily discuss prion infections, protein folding, and neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and scrapie. As a result, it is not possible to directly relate yeast prions to human amyloid diseases. However, one document does mention that 'transgenic strategies have been employed to test several hypothetical mechanisms in order to reproduce Alzheimer's disease-specific pathology in rodents.' This suggests that animal models are being used to study the basic mechanisms underlying human amyloid diseases.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B: no\""]
