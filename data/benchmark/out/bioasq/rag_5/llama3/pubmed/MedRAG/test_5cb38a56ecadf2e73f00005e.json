["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking if Myc is a tumor suppressor gene. The documents highlight the role of c-Myc in regulating cellular proliferation and differentiation, and how its overexpression can prevent differentiation of certain cell types. This suggests that c-Myc may have a more prominent role in promoting cell growth and proliferation rather than suppressing tumors. Additionally, the text mentions that genetic alterations of the c-myc locus are found in various malignancies, indicating a potential oncogenic function of Myc.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
