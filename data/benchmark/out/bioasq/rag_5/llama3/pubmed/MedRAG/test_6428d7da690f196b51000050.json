["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the role of 5' untranslated regions (UTRs) in regulating translation efficiency. In 'Identification of two critical base pairings in 5' untranslated regions affecting translation efficiency of synthetic uncapped globin mRNAs', it is shown that a specific sequence in the alpha 5' UTR can negatively affect translation efficiency. Additionally, 'Determinants of mRNA localization' highlights the role of cis-acting sequences on mRNA in mediating protein targeting and adds a new dimension to gene expression. This implies that UTRs can regulate gene expression.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
