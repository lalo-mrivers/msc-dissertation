["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking whether circular exons increase gene expression. The provided documents are about different topics such as group I intron-exon sequences self-splicing to produce circular exons, transcriptional and translational products of the yeast plasmid 2mu circle, control of adenovirus alternative RNA splicing, structure and expression of human insulin-like growth factor genes, and structure and expression of the human p58clk-1 protein kinase chromosomal gene. None of these documents directly address the question of whether circular exons increase gene expression. Therefore, it is necessary to consider the overall mechanisms of gene regulation and transcription.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
