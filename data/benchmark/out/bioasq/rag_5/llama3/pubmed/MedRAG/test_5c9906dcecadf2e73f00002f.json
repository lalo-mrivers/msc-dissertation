["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks if cardenolides (cardiac glycosides) are inhibitors of Na+/K+ ATPase. Cardiac glycosides like ouabain and Actinogen (Ay22241) have been studied to inhibit the enzyme in previous studies. Ay22241 was found to be as effective an inhibitor as ouabain, and inhibition by both was time-dependent but reversible. Strophanthidin has also been shown to inhibit H+, Ca2+-transporting ATPase and H+/K+-transporting ATPase activities. Cardiac glycosides like digitoxin, digoxin and ouabain have been found to bind to Na+-K+-ATPase in a sodium-dependent manner.\",\n\"answer_choice\": A"]
