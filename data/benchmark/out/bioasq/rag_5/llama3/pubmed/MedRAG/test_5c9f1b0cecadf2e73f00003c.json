["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the expression of protamines. Protamines are specifically mentioned as being involved in displacement of histones from nucleoproteins in one document (On the competition between protamines and histones). Additionally, protamines are labeled with fluorescamine to monitor DNA-protein complexes in another document (Application of fluorescamine to the study of protein-DNA interactions). This suggests that protamines have some functional role in protein-DNA interactions. However, there is no direct evidence provided on ubiquity of expression.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B: no\"\n}"]
