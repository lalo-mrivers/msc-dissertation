["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about αCGRP (alpha-Calcitonin Gene-Related Peptide) having amyloidogenic properties. The relevant information provided is about amyloid beta-protein fragment 25-35 causing activation of cytoplasmic calcium in neurons, and the processing of amyloid protein precursor to potentially amyloidogenic derivatives. Since there is no mention of αCGRP or its involvement in amyloid formation, we can conclude that it does not have amyloidogenic properties.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
