["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to the provided documents, it is clear that IFN-gamma induces the expression of IDO. In 'Induction of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase in human cells in vitro' it is stated that IFN-gamma is the most effective principle responsible for IDO induction in human cells in vitro. Similarly, in 'Relationship between interferon-gamma, indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase, and tryptophan catabolism' it is mentioned that interferon-gamma induces an enzyme of tryptophan catabolism, indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO). Furthermore, in 'Analysis of interferon-gamma resistant mutants that are possibly defective in their signaling mechanism' it is stated that the resistance to IFN-gamma was inversely correlated with the inducibility of IDO in these mutants.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
