["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks if phospholipid hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidase (PHGPx) is a selenoprotein. From the provided documents, we can see that PHGPx is a monomeric, membrane-associated enzyme containing one atom of Se per mole of protein. This information is provided in the document 'Mammalian selenoproteins'. Additionally, it is mentioned that the primary structure of PHGPx was partially elucidated by sequencing peptides obtained by cyanogen bromide cleavage and tryptic digestion and by isolating and sequencing corresponding cDNA fragments covering about 75% of the total sequence. Based on these data PHGPx can be rated as a selenoprotein homologous, but poorly related to classical glutathione peroxidase (GPx). This suggests that PHGPx contains selenium.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
