["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the pathologic features of Parkinson's disease (PD) and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), as well as the response to dopaminergic drugs. The apomorphine test is discussed as a means of differentiating idiopathic PD from multiple system atrophy and PSP. The clinical diagnosis of PS is also explored, highlighting the challenges in distinguishing between various forms of PS. Based on this information, it appears that the pathologic features of PSP are characterized by a loss of striatal D2 receptors, which would likely affect the response to dopaminergic drugs like Tilavonemab. Therefore, it can be inferred that Tilavonemab is unlikely to be effective for PSP.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
