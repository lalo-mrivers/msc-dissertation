["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking if METTL1 overexpression is associated with better patient survival. The provided documents are about the methylation of tRNA, chromosome number correlating with survival, selective methylation being an incorrect hypothesis, and mutation of human lymphoblasts by methylnitrosourea. There is no direct information about METTL1 or its relationship to patient survival in these documents. However, we can deduce that the question might be related to tRNA methylation as it talks about the level and pattern of methylation being characteristic of the tRNA species and origin.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
