["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents discuss transcriptional enhancement and regulation by various proteins. There is no direct mention of negative enhancers. However, the document 'Repression by Jun of the Polyoma-virus enhancer overrides activation in a cell specific manner' suggests that Jun can have an overriding repressing effect on enhancer activity, which could be interpreted as a negative enhancer. This implies that there may be proteins that can act as negative regulators of transcriptional enhancement.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
