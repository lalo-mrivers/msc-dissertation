["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"None of the provided documents explicitly discuss KCNQ1 splicing or modulation of arrhythmias. However, the concept of alternative splicing is mentioned in the document 'Alternatively spliced sodium channel transcripts in brain and muscle.' This suggests that the splicing of genes can lead to different isoforms with distinct properties. Given this information, it is possible to infer that modulation of KCNQ1 splicing could potentially prevent arrhythmias.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
