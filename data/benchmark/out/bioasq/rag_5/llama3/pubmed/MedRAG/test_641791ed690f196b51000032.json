["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about SARS-CoV-2 transmission through breast milk. None of the provided documents mention SARS-CoV-2 or COVID-19. However, they do discuss HIV transmission through breast milk. The relevant information suggests that breastfeeding increases the risk of HIV transmission, but it's not a major route of transmission. Additionally, there is evidence that breastfeeding protects against some childhood illnesses.

Therefore, we must rely on general knowledge about viral transmission through breast milk.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
