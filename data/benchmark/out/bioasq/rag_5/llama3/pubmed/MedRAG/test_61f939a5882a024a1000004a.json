["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the effectiveness of tivantinib for MET-high hepatocellular carcinoma. Since there are no specific documents mentioning tivantinib or MET-high hepatocellular carcinoma, we cannot find direct answers from the provided documents. However, we can infer that chemoembolization has shown promising results in improving survival rates comparable to resection (document 4). This suggests that some forms of chemotherapy may be effective. Additionally, document 1 mentions that only a few patients have resectable tumours at presentation, indicating that most patients require non-resectable treatment options. Document 3 discusses the high incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma in sub-Saharan Africa, but does not provide information on specific treatments or outcomes.\n\nGiven this information, we can conclude that while there is no direct evidence on tivantinib's effectiveness for MET-high hepatocellular carcinoma, some forms of chemotherapy have shown promising results. We cannot make a definitive statement about the effectiveness of tivantinib without further research.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
