["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about whether Panitumumab prolongs survival of biliary tract cancer patients. We need to find information related to this question from the provided documents. One document talks about carcinoma of the extrahepatic bile ducts and states that the best results are obtained by excision of the tumour, but only 10% of tumours were considered resectable.
