["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about using radiosurgery for DNET (dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumors) tumors. The relevant documents mention stereotactic radiosurgery as a treatment option for selected cerebral vascular malformations and brain tumors, but do not specifically mention DNET tumors. However, the documents describe the surgical management of malignant brain tumors, including primary brain tumors in adults, which may include DNET tumors. Primary brain tumors in adults can vary in their behavior depending on factors such as cell of origin, site of occurrence, morphology, and pattern of spread. Although the incidence of primary brain tumors is increasing in frequency, the prognosis of patients with these neoplasms has improved considerably due to recent advances in microsurgery, radiation treatment, and chemotherapy.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
