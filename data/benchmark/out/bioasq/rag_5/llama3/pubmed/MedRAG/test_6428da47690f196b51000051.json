["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about whether epigenetic status of introns can affect gene expression. The relevant documents mention DNA methylation as a mechanism to modulate compartmentalization of DNA and ensure regional areas of transcriptionally active chromatin replicate earlier than the bulk transcriptionally inactive chromatin. This suggests that epigenetic modifications, including those in introns, can influence gene expression. Additionally, epigenetic mechanisms are mentioned as being responsible for heritable changes in gene expression, which also implies that intron epigenetic status can affect gene expression.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
