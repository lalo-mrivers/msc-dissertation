["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe how epigenetic modifications can be influenced by parental germlines and affect the potential for expression of alleles. This suggests that epigenetic changes can be heritable. Additionally, the document on genomic imprinting highlights parent-of-origin differences in phenotype, which implies that epigenetic changes can be inherited from parents. Furthermore, the article on chromatin dynamics mentions that dynamic behavior of chromatin has important functional roles in the modulation of genetic activity, and the alteration of methylation patterns observed during tumor progression may mark abnormalities of chromatin organization. This supports the idea that epigenetic changes can be heritable.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
