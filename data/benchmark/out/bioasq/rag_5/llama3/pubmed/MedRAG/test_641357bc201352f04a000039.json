["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about necroptosis, which is not mentioned explicitly in the provided documents. However, apoptosis, a form of programmed cell death, is discussed extensively. Since necroptosis and apoptosis are both forms of programmed cell death, we can draw some parallels between the two. Apoptosis is characterized by the formation of membrane-bound bodies containing intact organelles (apoptotic bodies). This suggests that there may not be a complete disruption of the cell membrane during this process. In fact, the documents describe the 'condensation of chromatin and cytoplasm' and 'fragmentation of the cell', which implies that the cell membrane remains intact. Therefore, we can assume that necroptosis, as a form of programmed cell death, may not involve complete disruption of the cell membrane.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
