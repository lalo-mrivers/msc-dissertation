["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents provide information about post-translational modifications (PTMs) of proteins. ADP-ribosylation is one of the PTMs mentioned in the documents. Specifically, it is discussed as a modification that can occur on proteins involved in crucial cellular processes. Additionally, there are multiple references to ADP-ribose and its role in protein modification reactions. Based on this information, we can conclude that ADP-ribosylation is indeed a PTM.\",\n\"answer_choice\": A"]
