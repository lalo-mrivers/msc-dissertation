["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Avelumab is a monoclonal antibody that binds to a shed bladder tumor-associated antigen. This information is found in the 'Evaluation of a new bladder tumor marker' document. There is no direct mention of avelumab being effective for bladder cancer, but it does highlight its potential as a diagnostic and prognostic tool. Additionally, the 'An immunohistological demonstration of c-erbB-2 oncoprotein expression in primary urothelial bladder cancer' study suggests that monoclonal antibodies have been developed to target specific antigens associated with bladder tumors. The 'Molecular and immunologic approaches in the management of bladder cancer' document also mentions the potential for monoclonal antibodies as diagnostic and prognostic tools, but does not specifically mention avelumab. Based on this information, it can be inferred that avelumab may have some effectiveness for bladder cancer due to its mechanism of action.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
