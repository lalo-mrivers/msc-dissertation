["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, resistance training is associated with increasing muscle hypertrophy. For example, in 'Muscle hypertrophy response to resistance training in older women', it is stated that 'Cross-sectional area of type II muscle fibers significantly increased in the exercisers (20.1 +/- 6.8%, P = 0.02) compared with baseline.' This suggests that resistance training can lead to an increase in muscle fiber cross-sectional area, which is a measure of muscle hypertrophy. Similarly, in 'Strength and skeletal muscle adaptations in heavy-resistance-trained women after detraining and retraining', it is found that the initial 20-wk training program caused an increase in hypertrophy of all three major fiber types. Therefore, resistance training can lead to increased muscle hypertrophy.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
