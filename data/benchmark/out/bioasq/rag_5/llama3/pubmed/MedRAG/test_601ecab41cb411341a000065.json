["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks if adenosine signaling is prognostic for cancer outcome. We need to look at the relevant documents provided. In [Prognostic significance of the cyclic AMP concentration in acute leukemias], it is mentioned that patients with good clinical response had significantly faster turnover and lower cAMP-levels than those who failed to respond to treatment. This suggests that cAMP levels may be prognostic for cancer outcome. However, adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) is not directly involved in the question. In [Adenosine modulates cell growth in human epidermoid carcinoma], it is mentioned that adenosine evokes a biphasic response and involves both A1 (inhibitory) and A2 (stimulatory) adenosine receptors in regulating cell growth of tumor cells. This suggests that adenosine signaling may be involved in cancer outcome. In [Adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate and guanosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate levels in human breast cancer tissue], it is mentioned that intracellular levels of adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate were increased significantly as compared to normal breast tissues. This suggests that high levels of cAMP may be a poor prognosis marker. Therefore, based on the provided documents, we can conclude that adenosine signaling may be prognostic for cancer outcome.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
