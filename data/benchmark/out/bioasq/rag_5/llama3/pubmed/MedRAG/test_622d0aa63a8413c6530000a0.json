["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents discuss protein kinases and their roles in cell growth and development. The cdc2 protein kinase is mentioned as being activated by binding to a regulatory subunit called cyclin. Protein phosphorylation and dephosphorylation are discussed as mechanisms of signal integration in eukaryotic cells, with protein phosphatases playing a role in the regulated removal of phosphate groups from proteins. There is no mention of ASF1 or Tousled-like kinases in these documents.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
