["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks if a comet assay measures radiation-induced mutations. The provided documents discuss DNA damage caused by ionizing radiation, including double-strand breaks (DSBs), which are relevant for cell killing. Molecular assays of radiation-induced DNA damage mention the use of pulsed-field gel electrophoresis to study DSB induction and repair. There is no specific information about comet assays in these documents. However, it can be inferred that comet assay measures DNA strand breaks, such as those caused by ionizing radiation.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
