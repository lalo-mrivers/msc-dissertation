["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents provided discuss analytical methods, quality control, and detection limits. The concept of LOQ (limit of quantitation) and LOD (limit of detection) is discussed in the document 'Detection of substituted benzenes in water at the pg/ml level using solid-phase microextraction and gas chromatography-ion trap mass spectrometry'. According to this document, LOQ is defined as 50 pg/ml benzene absorbed onto the fiber, while LOD is defined as 15 pg/ml benzene. These values are not the same, suggesting that LOQ and LOD are different concepts.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
