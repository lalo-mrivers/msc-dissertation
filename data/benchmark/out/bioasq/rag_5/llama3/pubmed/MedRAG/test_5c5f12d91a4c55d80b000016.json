["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The molecular properties of the sodium channel mention that brevetoxins and ciguatoxins act at neurotoxin receptor site 5, which is located on the alpha subunit of the sodium channel. Peptide segments in domain IV of that subunit are important in brevetoxin binding. This suggests that peptides can bind to this receptor site. Chlorotoxin acts at neurotoxin receptor site 5 as well. Therefore, chlorotoxin must be a peptide.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
