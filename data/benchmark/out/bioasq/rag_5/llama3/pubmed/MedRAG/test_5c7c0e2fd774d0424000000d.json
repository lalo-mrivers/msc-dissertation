["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about phagosomal proteins. The documents provided discuss ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation. In eukaryotes, ubiquitination of substrate proteins is mediated by a remarkably diverse array of enzymes. Proteins are selectively destroyed through the 26S protease pathway. The complexity of the ubiquitin system suggests a central role for protein turnover in cell regulation. There is no direct mention of phagosomal proteins or ubiquitination in the provided documents.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
