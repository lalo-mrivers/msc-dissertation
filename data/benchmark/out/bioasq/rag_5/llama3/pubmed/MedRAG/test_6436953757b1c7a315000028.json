["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking if Functional Neurological Disorder (FND) is classified as a psychosomatic disorder. The provided documents discuss the classification of psychophysiologic disorders and neuroses. However, there is no specific mention of FND or functional neurological disorders in the provided documents. Therefore, we must rely on the general concepts discussed to answer this question. Psychosomatic disorders are mentioned in the context of DSM-II's classification system, which lists a group of disorders as distinct from other organic diseases. The authors suggest that there is a need for a new method of classification, but they do not specify FND or functional neurological disorders as being classified under psychosomatic disorders. Instead, they propose a multiaxial method of classification that would make it possible to indicate the role of psychological factors in all physical disorders. Therefore, based on the provided documents, we can conclude that FND is not specifically classified as a psychosomatic disorder.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B: no\""]
