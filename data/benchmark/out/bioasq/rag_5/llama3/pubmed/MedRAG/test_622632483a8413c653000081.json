["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents suggest that there may be an immunogenic mechanism involved in the etiology of preeclampsia. The increased production of oxygen-free radicals, elastase, or both by activated lymphoid cells in the pregnant decidua may be the link between hypothetical immunologic mechanisms and endothelial injury occurring in preeclampsia. Immunological aspects of the pathogenesis of pregnancy hypertension also imply that changes involving the immune system may instigate disorders in other systems. Recent investigations into the pathophysiology and immunobiology of preeclampsia have strongly implicated immunologic dysfunction as a central feature of this disease. A hypothesis is presented which unifies current research with clinical manifestations, attempting to clarify the etiology of preeclampsia. These findings suggest that disruption of immune regulation mechanisms may be associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes, including preeclampsia.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
