["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The passage 'An acquired state: epigenetic mechanisms in transcription' discusses how epigenetic mechanisms can regulate gene expression by governing the way sequences are read by the transcriptional machinery. This suggests that epigenetic changes can affect how DNA is interpreted, but it does not imply a change to the underlying DNA sequence. The passage 'Chromatin dynamics and the modulation of genetic activity' also mentions the dynamic behavior of chromatin having important functional roles in the modulation of genetic activity, which implies that epigenetic changes can alter gene expression without altering the DNA sequence.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
