["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The article 'Penetration of some O-and/or N-methylated norepinephrine derivatives through the rat blood brain barrier' suggests that lipid solubility is not a sole determinant for compounds to cross the blood-brain barrier. The passage of peptides, including bergapten, across the blood-brain barrier has been shown to be influenced by pharmacological agents and physiological events. It is possible that bergapten could be modified or combined with other molecules to enhance its ability to cross the blood-brain barrier.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
