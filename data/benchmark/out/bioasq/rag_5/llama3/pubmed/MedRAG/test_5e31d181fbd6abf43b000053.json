["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents provided discuss the location of the Huntington disease gene on chromosome 4p16.3 and describe attempts to identify the gene. The first document estimates that the region contains around 100 genes. The second document reports a recombination event in a sporadic case of HD, which suggests a direct link between the site of the recombination and HD. The third document identifies a fibroblast growth factor receptor gene (FGFR3) as a possible candidate for the HD gene. The fourth document describes complex patterns of linkage disequilibrium in the HD region and reports that the degree of disequilibrium does not show a continuous increase across the physical map.\n\nThere is no mention of CTG repeats or the HTT gene, which suggests that Huntington's disease may not be caused by an expansion of a CTG repeat in the HTT gene on Chromosome 4.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B: no\"\n}"]
