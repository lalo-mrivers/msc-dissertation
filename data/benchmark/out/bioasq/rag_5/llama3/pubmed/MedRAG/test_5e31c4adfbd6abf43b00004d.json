["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, it is clear that mesothelioma is a rare tumor whose incidence is rising. The articles discuss various studies on asbestos exposure and its relation to mesothelioma. Specifically, they highlight the connection between occupational and environmental history and the development of mesothelioma. For instance, in 'Mesothelioma in relation to asbestos fibre exposure', 69 out of 70 patients had a significant history of exposure to asbestos dust. Similarly, in 'Non-occupational exposure to asbestos and malignant mesothelioma in females', it was found that a significantly greater number of husbands and fathers of cases worked in asbestos-related industries, suggesting indirect asbestos exposure as a risk factor. These findings collectively support the notion that mesothelioma is caused by asbestos exposure.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
