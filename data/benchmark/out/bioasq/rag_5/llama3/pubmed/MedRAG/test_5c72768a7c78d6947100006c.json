["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The provided documents discuss various aspects of X-chromosome inactivation and its relationship to gene expression. One document highlights the expression of common fragile sites on the human X chromosome, which corresponds with active gene regions. Another document discusses the transmission of X-linked mental retardation from an unaffected male, suggesting a possible role for somatic mutation and germinal mosaicism. The documents also touch upon the concept of dosage compensation in mammals, achieved by the inactivation of one of the X chromosomes in females. A separate document explores the molecular detection of altered X-inactivation patterns in genetic disease diagnosis.\n\nConsidering these points, we can deduce that genes that escape X-chromosome inactivation may be related to mental impairment. The expression of common fragile sites on the human X chromosome is observed in regions with active genes, which could imply a connection between gene activity and intellectual function.\n\nFurthermore, the presence of somatic mutation and germinal mosaicism in the transmission of X-linked mental retardation suggests that altered X-inactivation patterns can contribute to disease manifestation. This idea is reinforced by the concept of dosage compensation, where the inactivation of one X chromosome in females ensures equal expression of genes between males and females.\n\nIn light of these findings, it appears reasonable to conclude that genes that escape X-chromosome inactivation may be related to mental impairment.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
