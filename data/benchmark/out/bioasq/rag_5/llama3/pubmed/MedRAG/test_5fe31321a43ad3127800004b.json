["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks if yeast fbp1 is affected by glucose starvation stress. We can look at the documents to see how fbpase (fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase) behaves in response to glucose. In the document 'Biosynthesis and regulation of fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase and phosphofructokinase in Saccharomyces cerevisiae grown in the presence of glucose and gluconeogenic carbon sources', we see that FBPase activity appears after the complete disappearance of glucose from the growth medium. This suggests that fbpase is indeed affected by glucose starvation stress.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
