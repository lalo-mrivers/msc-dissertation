["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about C/EBP, which is a transcription factor involved in regulating the apolipoprotein B gene. The passage states that C/EBP binds to a specific site within the 97-bp footprint of the enhancer region. Additionally, C/EBP acts synergistically with HNF-1 and protein II to enhance transcription of the apolipoprotein B gene. There is no mention of CIDEB or any mutations related to it.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
