["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks if mitochondria can pass through membrane nanotubes. The provided documents describe various aspects of mitochondrial function, including protein sorting, high-conductance pathways, oxygen permeability, and mechanisms by which small molecules alter ionic permeability. One document specifically mentions that mitochondrial precursor proteins are imported at sites of close contact between the outer and inner membranes, with some polypeptides passing through the intermembrane space on their route from the outer membrane to the inner membrane. This information suggests that mitochondria can indeed pass through the intermembrane space, which is a part of membrane nanotubes.\",\n\"answer_choice\": A\n}"]
