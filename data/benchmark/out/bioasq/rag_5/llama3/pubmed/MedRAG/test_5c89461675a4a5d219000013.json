["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant document discussing Netrin-1 is 'Axon guidance by molecular gradients'. According to this document, it has been shown that axons can orient in response to smooth gradients of immobilized substrate molecules. This suggests that Netrin-1 may be a substrate molecule involved in axon guidance rather than a secreted protein.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
