["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks whether epistaxis is associated with dental implant placement. The relevant documents are the ones related to ophthalmic artery embolization for control of epistaxis and dental extraction. There is no direct mention of dental implants in these documents, but one document mentions invasive maxillary aspergillosis after dental extraction. This suggests that complications can arise from dental procedures, including dental implant placement, which may lead to epistaxis. However, the connection between dental implant placement and epistaxis is not explicitly stated. Therefore, the answer should be based on the available information.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
