["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents discuss the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and its role in restricting the passage of certain substances into the central nervous system. The documents mention that the BBB is characterized by tight junctions at the endothelium of the capillary wall, which restrict passive diffusion of hydrophilic compounds like digoxin. Additionally, they discuss various mechanisms for transport across the BBB, including carrier systems and saturable and nonsaturable mechanisms for peptides. Based on this information, it appears that the passage of Crocus sativus extracts into the central nervous system would be restricted by the BBB.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B: no\"\n}"]
