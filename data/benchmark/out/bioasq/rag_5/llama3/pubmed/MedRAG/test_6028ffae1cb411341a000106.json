["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks if erenumab targets calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP). The provided documents describe monoclonal antibodies raised to human CGRP. Some of these mAbs are specific for alpha or beta forms of CGRP, while others react with both. This information suggests that some antibodies can target different forms of CGRP. However, there is no direct mention of erenumab in the provided documents. Therefore, it's necessary to look beyond the provided texts to determine if erenumab targets CGRP. Erenumab is a monoclonal antibody approved for migraine prevention. Its mechanism of action involves binding to calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptors on trigeminal neurons, which are involved in migraine pathophysiology. This information suggests that erenumab does target CGRP.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
