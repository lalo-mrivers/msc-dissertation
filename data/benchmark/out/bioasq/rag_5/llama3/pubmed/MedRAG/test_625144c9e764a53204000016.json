["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking if neurofilament light is a marker for disease. From the relevant documents, it can be seen that IgG monoclonal proteins from patients with axonal peripheral neuropathies bind to different epitopes of the 68 kDa neurofilament protein, and one of these epitopes is common to other intermediate filaments such as desmin and vimentin. This suggests that neurofilaments are involved in disease. Additionally, the document 'Biochemistry of the filaments of brain' states that intermediate filaments may represent a highly conserved and widely distributed fibrous protein system, implying that changes to these proteins could be indicative of disease.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
