["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Mucins are large molecular weight glycoproteins characterized by carbohydrate sugars attached via 'O-glycosidic' linkages to serine or threonine. Biosynthesis of mucin oligosaccharides is initiated near the transit of the proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi and proceeds rapidly during passage to the cell surface. In some carcinomas a second O-glycosylation pathway adds new oligosaccharides to the glycoproteins after they have reached the cell surface, presumably during recycling.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
