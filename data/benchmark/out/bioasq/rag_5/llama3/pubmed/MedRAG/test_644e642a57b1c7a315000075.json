["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"There is no direct evidence provided that suggests all proteins start with methionine. In fact, the documents provide information about post-translational modifications of proteins, including the oxidation of methionine to methionine sulfoxide. This implies that not all proteins contain methionine from the beginning. Additionally, the document on synthesis and degradation of methylated proteins mentions that L-(Methyl-14C)-methionine was administered i.p. to mice, suggesting that methionine can be incorporated into proteins after synthesis. Therefore, it is unlikely that all proteins start with methionine.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
