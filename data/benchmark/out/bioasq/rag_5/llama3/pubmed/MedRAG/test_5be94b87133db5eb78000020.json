["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents discuss genetic disorders affecting the inner ear, transgenic technology, and the study of mammalian development. The paper on vestibular dysfunction highlights a kindred with autosomal dominantly inherited ataxia, suggesting that genetic heterogeneity may limit the influence of modern genetic practice in genetically deaf patients. The papers on genetics of deafness and symposium on hearing loss emphasize the importance of understanding etiologic factors and pathophysiology in the evaluation and management of hearing loss. These findings suggest that gene therapy could potentially restore auditory function, as it provides a direct experimental approach to the study of the control and tissue specificity of gene expression.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
