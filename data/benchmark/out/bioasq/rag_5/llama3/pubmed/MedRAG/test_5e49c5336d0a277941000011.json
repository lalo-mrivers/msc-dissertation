["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The provided documents discuss various molecular markers for lung cancer diagnosis and prognosis. One specific marker mentioned is the overexpression of p185 protein encoded by the c-erbB-2/neu gene in non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLCs). According to the document 'Overexpression of the c-erbb-2/neu-encoded p185 protein in primary lung cancer', p185 expression was correlated with lymph node metastasis and advanced clinical stages, suggesting poor clinical prognostic indicators. There is no mention of LY6K or its association with prognosis in non-small cell lung cancer patients.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
