["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents suggest that macrophages play a significant role in malignant gliomas. In 'Cytokines and immunoregulatory molecules in malignant glial neoplasms', it is found that tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin (IL)-6 are prominent in infiltrating macrophages, while transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) is more prominent in those tumors with little TNF-alpha-positive macrophage infiltration. This study suggests that the cytokines produced by macrophages have a regulatory role in tumor growth. In 'Macrophages in experimental and human brain tumors. Part 2: studies of the macrophage content of human brain tumors', it is found that most nervous system tumors, including glioblastomas, have a high macrophage content. This could be related to their immunogenicity and may contribute to the rarity of brain-tumor metastases. Therefore, based on these findings, tumour-associated macrophages likely have a prognostic role in gliomas.\", \"answer_choice\": A}"]
