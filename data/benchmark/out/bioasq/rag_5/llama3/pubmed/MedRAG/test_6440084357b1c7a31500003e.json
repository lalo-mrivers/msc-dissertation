["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant information about NF-kB binding activity is found in the document 'Modulation of transcription factor NF-kappa B binding activity by oxidation-reduction in vitro.' According to this document, NF-kB binding can be inhibited by agents that modify free sulfhydryls. This suggests that omaveloxolone, if it affects NF-kB binding, would likely do so by modifying the redox state of NF-kB. Since there is no information about omaveloxolone's effect on NF-kB, we must rely on the information provided about the effects of other agents on NF-kB.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
