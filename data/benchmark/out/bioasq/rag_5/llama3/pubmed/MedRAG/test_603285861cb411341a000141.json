["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about Toll-like receptors (TLRs) being induced by microbes. We need to find relevant information from the provided documents. The first document talks about bacterial endotoxin and its structure-activity relationships, but it doesn't mention TLRs or induction. The second document discusses immunity in acute bacterial infections and mentions various effector mechanisms, but again, there is no mention of TLRs. The third document talks about multiple receptors for endotoxin, including CD14, which recognizes lipopolysaccharide with the aid of a serum protein, lipopolysaccharide-binding protein, but it doesn't specifically mention TLRs or induction. The fourth document discusses recognition mechanisms in infectious disease and mentions pathogen-host recognition mechanisms, but again, there is no information about TLRs or induction. Based on this analysis, we can conclude that the question is not addressed by any of the provided documents.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
