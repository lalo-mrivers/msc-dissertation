["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents describe Duchenne muscular dystrophy as a disease caused by defective dystrophin. The article 'Defective dystrophin in Duchenne and Becker dystrophy myotubes in cell culture' mentions that the protein product of the Duchenne muscular dystrophy locus is dystrophin, which was not detected in myotubes cultured from Duchenne myoblasts. This suggests that dystrophin plays a crucial role in the disease. The document 'Current status of Duchenne muscular dystrophy' mentions treatment options such as steroids and direct injection of an artificial gene for dystrophin. Golodirsen is not mentioned in any of these documents, so it cannot be concluded whether it is effective or not.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B: no\""]
