["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about Tecovirimat's effectiveness for smallpox. Since the documents do not mention Tecovirimat specifically, we need to look for information on vaccines and treatments for pox diseases. The document 'Vaccination against pox diseases under immunosuppressive conditions' mentions that attenuated vaccinia virus strain MVA is safe even under immunosuppressive conditions, which might be relevant. However, there is no mention of Tecovirimat or its use in treating smallpox. Therefore, based on the provided information, we cannot determine whether Tecovirimat is effective for smallpox.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B: no\"\n}"]
