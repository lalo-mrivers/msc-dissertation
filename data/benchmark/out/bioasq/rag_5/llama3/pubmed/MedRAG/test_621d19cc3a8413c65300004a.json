["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, it is clear that keratin intermediate filaments are used in diagnostic pathology, particularly in cancer diagnosis. The document 'Use of keratin antibodies in tumor diagnosis' specifically highlights the use of keratin-specific antibodies as in situ markers of keratin expression. Additionally, 'Keratins as markers that distinguish normal and tumor-derived mammary epithelial cells' suggests that keratin 5 (K5) mRNA and protein can be used to differentiate between normal and tumor-derived cells. This information collectively implies that cytokeratin is a potential tumor marker.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
