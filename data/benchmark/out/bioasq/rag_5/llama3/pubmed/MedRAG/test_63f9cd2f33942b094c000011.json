["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking whether microexon alternative splicing of small GTPase regulators has implication in central nervous system diseases. The relevant documents discuss the NF1 gene and its role in neuroectodermal differentiation and genesis of brain tumors. The document also discusses the implication of aberrant regulation of alternative splicing in tumor formation. Additionally, the document highlights that brain tumors predominantly express the neurofibromatosis type 1 gene transcripts containing the 63 base insert in the region coding for GTPase activating protein-related domain. Based on this information, it can be concluded that microexon alternative splicing of small GTPase regulators has implication in central nervous system diseases.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
