["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks if alternative splicing is associated with heart disease. The provided documents discuss alternative splicing of cardiac tropomyosin gene, contractile protein isoforms in muscle development, and the efficiency of alternative splicing in generating protein diversity. While there are no direct references to heart disease, it can be inferred that since alternative splicing is a mechanism for generating protein diversity in muscles, including cardiac muscle, it may have some association with heart disease.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
