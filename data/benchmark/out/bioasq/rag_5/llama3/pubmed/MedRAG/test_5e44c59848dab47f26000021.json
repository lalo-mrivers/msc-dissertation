["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks whether tirilazad should be used for treatment of ischemic stroke. In the first document 'Medical management of acute cerebral ischemia', it is mentioned that experimental data suggest that the optimal time for intervention is the hour immediately following brain ischemia, which implies that early intervention is crucial. In the second document 'Tirilazad reduces cortical infarction after transient but not permanent focal cerebral ischemia in rats', tirilazad reduced cortical infarct volume after transient ischemia by 40% in Wistar rats and 23% in spontaneously hypertensive rats, suggesting its potential efficacy. However, it did not reduce infarction after permanent ischemia. The document 'Pathophysiology of stroke' suggests that therapeutic intervention should start when the ischemic tissue still retains a potential for recovery, which is consistent with tirilazad's effect on reducing cortical infarct volume after transient ischemia. The documents 'New aspects of calcium antagonists for treatment of cerebrovascular disease' and 'Thrombolytic therapy' provide general information about stroke treatment but do not specifically mention tirilazad.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
