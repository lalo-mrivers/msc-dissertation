["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"This question is related to the regulatory approval times for new chemical entities. The provided documents suggest that there are differences in the approval times among countries. The document on medical device regulations in the New Europe does not provide information about pharmaceutical licensing, so it's not relevant to this question. The comparison of regulatory approval times for new chemical entities in Australia, Canada, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and the United States provides insight into the approval times in these countries. Specifically, the document states that the median approval time in the UK was approximately 11 months, whereas in other countries it ranged from 23 to 29 months. This suggests that there might be a difference in the licensing process for Vivotif between Europe (represented by the UK) and the US.\n\nThe pricing of pharmaceuticals: an international comparison provides information on the different pricing policies and regulations used in various countries, but this does not directly impact the regulatory approval times or the licensing of specific drugs like Vivotif.\n\nThe drug lag issue: the debate seen from an international perspective reviews the literature related to the delay in introduction of new drugs. This is also not directly relevant to the question about Vivotif's licensing status.\n\nDrug regulation in the United Kingdom provides information on the British system for evaluating new drug applications, but this does not provide direct insight into the regulatory approval times or the licensing process for specific drugs like Vivotif.\n\nBased on this analysis, I conclude that the UK and US have different regulatory approval times, which may result in differences in the licensing status of Vivotif between these countries.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B: no\""]
