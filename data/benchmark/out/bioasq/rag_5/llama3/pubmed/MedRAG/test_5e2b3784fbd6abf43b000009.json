["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"No relevant information about GRG5 is provided in any of the documents. The first document discusses T locus mutations and their effects on embryonic development, but does not mention GRG5. The second document describes DNA methylation patterns during mouse embryogenesis, but again does not mention GRG5. The third document discusses an insertional mutation affecting early postimplantation development, and the fourth document discusses the coordinate inactivation of class III genes during gastrula-neurula transition. None of these documents provide any information about GRG5 or its involvement in mouse embryonic development.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
