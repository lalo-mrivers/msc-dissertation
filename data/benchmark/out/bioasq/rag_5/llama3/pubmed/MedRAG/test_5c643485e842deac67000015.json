["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks if de novo mutations in regulatory elements are responsible for neurodevelopmental disorders. From the provided documents, we can see that insertional mutations of 'classical' and novel genes in transgenic mice may be causally related to abnormal phenotypes (Insertional mutation of 'classical' and novel genes in transgenic mice). Furthermore, regulatory mutations in gene promoter/regulatory regions are associated with either increases or decreases in transcriptional activity mediated by the altered binding behaviour of trans-acting protein factors to specific DNA sequences in the promoter region (Regulatory mutations and human genetic disease). Additionally, we have a report on X-linked nonspecific mental retardation where 12 patients had different mutations detected which were studied in detail by direct sequencing. One of these reports found 11 different mutations likely to give rise to significant structural changes in the predicted protein (Mutations in the candidate gene for Norrie disease).\n\nBased on this information, it is possible that de novo mutations in regulatory elements could be responsible for neurodevelopmental disorders.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A: yes\"\n}"]
