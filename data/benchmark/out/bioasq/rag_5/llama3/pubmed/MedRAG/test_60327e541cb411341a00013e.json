["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The first document mentions that Hunter syndrome is caused by deficiency of the lysosomal exohydrolase iduronate-2-sulphatase (IDS) and the IDS gene has been localized to Xq28, distal to the fragile X mutation. This suggests that Hunter's disease is associated with the X chromosome. The other documents do not contradict this finding. Therefore, I conclude that yes, Hunter's disease is associated with the X Chromosome.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
