["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks if Lubeluzole (or calcium antagonists) should be used for treatment of ischemic stroke. Based on the provided documents, it is mentioned that clinical trials have been inconclusive and flawed by delayed patient entry in acute stroke patients. Furthermore, cardiovascular side effects may limit the safety and efficacy of calcium antagonists in acute stroke patients. However, there are experimental data suggesting that early intervention can be beneficial. Additionally, some studies suggest that calcium antagonists may improve neurological and functional outcome due to reduced infarct size and improved tissue metabolism. Therefore, it seems that the use of calcium antagonists or similar agents like Lubeluzole might have a place in the treatment of ischemic stroke.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B\n}"]
