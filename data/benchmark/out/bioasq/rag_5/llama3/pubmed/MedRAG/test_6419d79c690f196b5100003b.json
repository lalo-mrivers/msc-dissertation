["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents discuss the role of iron in oligodendrocytes. Iron-enriched oligodendrocytes were found to be present in most regions previously thought to lack such cells. The expression of transferrin mRNA, which plays a role in myelination and is found predominantly in oligodendrocytes, increases with age and requires the presence of mature oligodendrocytic population. Iron has been suggested to function in the formation and/or maintenance of the myelin sheet. These findings suggest that iron may regulate oligodendrocyte maturation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
