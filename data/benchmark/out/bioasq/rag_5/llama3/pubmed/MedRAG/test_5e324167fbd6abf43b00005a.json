["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, we can conclude that patients who have complete surgical resection of meningiomas may not require further treatment. However, for those who have subtotal removal, postoperative irradiation with a total tumor dose of 4500-5500 rads may delay or prevent recurrences. This suggests that radiation therapy is an important factor in the treatment and prevention of meningioma recurrence.\n\nThe document 'Long-term consequences of CNS treatment for childhood cancer' suggests that central nervous system (CNS) radiation, with or without chemotherapy, is a primary etiology for second malignancies. Although this complication is infrequent, the likelihood of developing a second malignancy is 10 times that of age-matched controls.\n\nGiven these findings, it is possible to infer that childhood leukemia survivors may be at an increased risk for meningiomas due to their exposure to CNS radiation as part of their treatment regimen. However, further research and data are needed to confirm this hypothesis.\",\n\"answer_choice\": A"]
