["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks whether genomic regulatory blocks (GRBs) are different from TADs. The provided documents describe chromatin structure, epigenetic mechanisms, and transcriptional control. TADs (topological associating domains) refer to chromosomal bands characterized by their structure and distinctive replication time. GRBs seem related to these domains, as they mention 'functional domains' that have discrete boundary elements. Step 1: Understand the context of GRBs and TADs; Step 2: Analyze the provided documents for relevant information on TADs and chromatin loops.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
