["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about whether ustekinumab is a polyclonal antibody. Polyclonal antibodies are those that bind to multiple epitopes on an antigen. Looking at the provided documents, we can see that monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are mentioned, which specifically immunoprecipitate a single epitope of IL-2R beta or recognize distinct epitopes on the human IL-2 receptor beta chain. This suggests that mAbs target specific epitopes rather than multiple ones. Bifunctional antibodies are also discussed, which have been produced by both chemical and biological means to target drugs, toxins, radiolabelled haptens, and effector cells onto diseased tissues. There is no mention of polyclonal antibodies or ustekinumab in these documents. Therefore, we can conclude that the information provided does not support the idea that ustekinumab is a polyclonal antibody.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B: no\""]
