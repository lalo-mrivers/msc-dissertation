["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents suggest that tumor-specific antigens can be shared by a significant proportion of human tumors. Various mechanisms can account for their expression: activation of normally silent genes; point mutations; chromosome translocations; and post-translational modifications of proteins. Some studies have identified specific mutant proteins that are recognized as tumor-specific antigens, which may be encoded by oncogenes or suppressor genes that have undergone structural mutations resulting from point mutations, chromosomal translocations, internal deletions and viral insertional mutagenesis.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
