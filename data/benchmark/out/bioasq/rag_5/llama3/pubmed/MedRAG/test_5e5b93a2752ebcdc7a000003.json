["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about Flotillin as an exosomal marker. We need to look for information on Flotillin's association with membrane subdomains or vesicles. Upon reviewing the documents, we find that GPI-anchored proteins, including Flotillin, are associated with detergent-resistant sheets and vesicles enriched in glycosphingolipids, but not with basolateral marker protein. This suggests that Flotillin is part of a complex that forms in the Golgi apparatus and plasma membrane, which supports its use as an exosomal marker.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A: yes\"\n}"]
