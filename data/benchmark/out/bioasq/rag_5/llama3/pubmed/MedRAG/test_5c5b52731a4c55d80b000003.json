["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, we can see that Fine-scale deletion mapping of the distal long arm of chromosome 6 in 70 human ovarian cancers suggests a commonly deleted region between loci defined by CI6-111 (D6S193) and CI6-24 (D6S149); these two markers are estimated to be 1.9 cM apart on the basis of linkage analysis. This result further defines a region containing a tumor suppressor gene involved in ovarian carcinoma within an approximately 2-megabase-long segment of chromosome 6q. Additionally, Allelotype of human ovarian cancer shows frequent losses were observed uniquely in serous and serous papillary cystadenocarcinomas on chromosomes 6q. Therefore, deletion at 6q24.2-26 is associated with the development of high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSOCs). Since this study does not provide data specifically about survival rates, we cannot draw a direct conclusion about whether deletion at 6q24.2-26 is associated with longer survival in patients with HGSOCs. However, it is likely that deletion at this region may be related to the prognosis of these patients.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
