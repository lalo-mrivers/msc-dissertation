["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the similarity of major royal jelly proteins to yellow proteins. After reviewing the provided documents, I didn't find any information that directly compares these two types of proteins. However, some points can be made: the document on the molecular nature of chloroplast thylakoid membranes mentions protein-protein complexes and pigment-free protein moieties, but it doesn't provide information about royal jelly or yellow proteins. The other documents are unrelated to this topic. Therefore, I will have to make an educated guess based on the general knowledge that major royal jelly proteins are usually found in bee products and yellow proteins might refer to proteins from a different biological source.\", \"answer_choice\": B}"]
