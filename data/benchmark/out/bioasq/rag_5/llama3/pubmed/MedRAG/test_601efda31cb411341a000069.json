["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the effects of bleomycin on the lungs. Bleomycin is known to cause an interstitial pneumonitis that can lead to fibrosis (Bleomycin-induced pulmonary toxicity). Additionally, morphological and functional modifications were seen in type II pneumocytes after acute treatment with bleomycin (On the pathogenesis of bleomycin lung toxicity), which might be the earliest stage of pulmonary damage. Furthermore, cases of reversible interstitial pneumonitis associated with low dose bleomycin have been reported (Reversible interstitial pneumonitis associated with low dose bleomycin). Cytotoxic drug-induced lung disease may also be caused by bleomycin, among other agents (Cytotoxic drug-induced lung disease). Finally, bleomycin is used as a tool to study the pathogenesis of interstitial pulmonary fibrosis due to its ability to induce biochemical and morphological changes in the lungs similar to those seen in humans. All these documents suggest that bleomycin has an effect on the lungs, which can be toxic.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
