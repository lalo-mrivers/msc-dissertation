["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks if RNA is methylated like DNA. The provided documents do not discuss the methylation of RNA or DNA in detail. However, it does mention the structure and properties of double and triple helices containing either all RNA, all DNA, or a mixture of the two. This information suggests that RNA is favored on both pyrimidine strands in forming a triple helix, which implies some unique property of RNA compared to DNA. Without direct evidence of methylation, we cannot conclude whether RNA is methylated like DNA.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B: no\"\n}"]
