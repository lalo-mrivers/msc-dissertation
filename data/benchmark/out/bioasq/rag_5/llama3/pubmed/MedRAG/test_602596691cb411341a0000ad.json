["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"JAK2 is a protein tyrosine kinase mentioned in the document 'JAK2, a third member of the JAK family of protein tyrosine kinases.' This suggests that there are other members of the JAK family. Tofacitinib is a JAK inhibitor, and its mechanism of action involves inhibition of cytokine function by interfering with ligand binding to specific cell-surface cytokine receptors, as mentioned in 'Inhibition of cytokine function: potential in autoimmune disease.'
