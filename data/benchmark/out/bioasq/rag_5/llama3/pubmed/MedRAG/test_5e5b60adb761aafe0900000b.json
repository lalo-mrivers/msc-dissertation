["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The provided documents primarily focus on P-glycoproteins and their functions as multidrug transporters. There is no specific mention of the protein ABCG2. However, since we are looking for information about its transmembrane characteristic, let's look at the description of P-glycoproteins. It is mentioned that P-glycoproteins are plasma membrane proteins containing two ATP-binding sites and twelve putative transmembrane segments. This suggests that they have a transmembrane structure. Although this does not directly answer the question about ABCG2, it provides insight into the general characteristics of multidrug transporters. ABCG2 might share similar features as P-glycoproteins since it is also a multidrug transporter.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
