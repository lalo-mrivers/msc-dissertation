["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The text does not explicitly state whether p85α homodimerizes or not. However, it can be inferred that p85α is the subunit of PI3-kinase that links the enzyme to the ligand-activated receptor. The study shows that recombinant p85 overexpressed in mammalian cells inhibited the binding of endogenous p85 and a 110 kd protein to the receptor and also blocked the association of PI3-kinase activity with the receptor. This suggests that p85α may not homodimerize, as its function is to link the enzyme to the receptor rather than form a dimer.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B: no\""]
