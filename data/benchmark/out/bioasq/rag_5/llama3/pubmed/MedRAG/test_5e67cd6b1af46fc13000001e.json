["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the anatomical and physiological aspects of the blood-brain barrier, its permeability, and various experimental techniques to study drug transport across it. AZD3759 is not mentioned as a specific compound in these documents. However, based on the general information provided about peptides crossing the blood-brain barrier by saturable and nonsaturable mechanisms, it can be inferred that AZD3759, being a peptide, may potentially cross the blood-brain barrier.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
