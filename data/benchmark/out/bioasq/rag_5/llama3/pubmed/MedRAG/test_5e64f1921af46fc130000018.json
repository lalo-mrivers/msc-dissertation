["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks if there is a vaccine for rotavirus. The provided documents describe the status of rotavirus vaccines in 1990, the safety and immunogenicity of oral tetravalent human-rhesus reassortant rotavirus vaccine in neonates, simultaneous administration of two human-rhesus rotavirus reassortant strains of VP7 serotype 1 and 2 specificity to infants and young children, and protection from rotavirus reinfection: a 2-year prospective study. These documents suggest that research on rotavirus vaccines has been ongoing since at least 1990. The studies mentioned present results on the safety and immunogenicity of oral tetravalent human-rhesus reassortant rotavirus vaccine in neonates, as well as the potential interactions between strains when administering two rotavirus vaccine strains simultaneously. Additionally, a study on protection from rotavirus reinfection indicates that natural infection can provide long-term immunity against homotypic serotype 1 reinfection. These findings collectively support the existence of vaccines for rotavirus.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
