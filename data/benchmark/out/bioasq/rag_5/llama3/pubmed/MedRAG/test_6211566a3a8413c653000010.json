["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about CPX-351's approval status by the FDA (Food and Drug Administration) and EMA (European Medicines Agency). Since there are no relevant documents provided mentioning CPX-351, I will look for any hints or mentions of similar drugs, investigational new drugs, or regulatory processes. Based on the given documents, it seems that they mainly focus on the regulatory process, FDA's role in new drug development and availability, and the philosophy and practice of federal regulation. There is no specific mention of CPX-351, but the context suggests that this question might be related to investigational drugs or new biologicals for cancer treatment. Since none of these documents provide direct information about CPX-351, I will rely on general knowledge that the FDA's role is to regulate and approve new drugs, including those for cancer treatment.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B: no\"\n}"]
