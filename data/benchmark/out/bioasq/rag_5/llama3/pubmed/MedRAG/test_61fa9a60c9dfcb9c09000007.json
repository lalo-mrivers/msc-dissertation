["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, there is no direct evidence or mention of istiratumab (also known as Mab 17-1A) being used for pancreatic cancer. However, one study (Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibody (Mab) in pancreatic adenocarcinoma) discusses the results of clinical trials using Mab 17-1A in patients with unresectable pancreatic exocrine cancer. The study reports no antitumor response and serious anaphylaxis in two patients. Another study (Phase II study of pibenzimol in pancreatic cancer) also found that Pibenzimol is inactive in patients with advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma, which suggests that the treatment may not be effective. Therefore, based on the available information, it seems unlikely that istiratumab would be a recommended treatment for pancreatic cancer.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B: no\"\n}"]
