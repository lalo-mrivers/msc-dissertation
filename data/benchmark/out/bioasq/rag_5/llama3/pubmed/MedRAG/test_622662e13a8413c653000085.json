["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about whether METTL3 can methylate long noncoding RNAs. According to the provided documents, METTL3 is a tRNA methylase (as mentioned in 'The methylation of tRNA'). This enzyme has specific enzymes for methylation with S adenosylmethionine as a methyl donor, and its activity varies depending on cell differentiation and tissue origin. There is no mention of METTL3 being involved in the methylation of non-coding RNAs or long noncoding RNAs specifically.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B: no\"\n}"]
