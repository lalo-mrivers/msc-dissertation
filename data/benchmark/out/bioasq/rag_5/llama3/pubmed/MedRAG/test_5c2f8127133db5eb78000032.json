["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about whole-genome duplications versus small-scale duplications in yeast. The provided documents describe various types of genomic changes, including chromosomal-length variants, rearrangements, and gene duplication. However, there is no direct information on whole-genome duplications specifically. Ribosomal DNA magnification is mentioned as a mechanism of increasing rRNA genes, but this is not related to genome duplication. Gene duplication is discussed as a means of increasing Aphtase activity, but this is a small-scale duplication event. Therefore, it can be inferred that the question refers to studies on yeast duplications, and we should look for relevant information from these studies.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B: no\"\n}"]
