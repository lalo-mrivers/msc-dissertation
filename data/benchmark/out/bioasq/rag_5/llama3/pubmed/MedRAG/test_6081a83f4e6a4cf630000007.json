["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"FKBP52 is also known as Hsp56. According to the provided documents, Hsp56 binds to immobilized FK506 and shows homology to FKBP-12 and FKBP-13. This suggests that Hsp56 may mediate immunosuppression and inhibition of T-cell proliferation by FK506, possibly via a cytosolic signal transduction pathway separate from that of FKBP-12 and FKBP-13. As a member of the heat shock protein family, Hsp56 is likely to be involved in protein folding and assembly, which are processes also mediated by other chaperone proteins such as Hsp90. Therefore, it can be inferred that Hsp56, or FKBP52, may function as a chaperone.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
