["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about whether ERAP2 enzyme is associated with birdshot chorioretinopathy. The documents provided describe different retinal diseases such as pigmentary paravenous chorioretinal degeneration, birdshot retinochoroidopathy, and retinal pigment epitheliitis. Stargardt's disease is also mentioned but it does not seem to be directly related to ERAP2. However, none of the documents mention ERAP2 or any specific enzyme associated with birdshot chorioretinopathy. Therefore, based on the provided information, we cannot conclude whether ERAP2 is associated with this disease.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B: no\"\n}"]
