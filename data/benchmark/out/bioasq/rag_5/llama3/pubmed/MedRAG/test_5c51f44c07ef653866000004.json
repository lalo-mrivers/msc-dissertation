["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the provided documents, we can see that there is a study on frequent somatic imbalance of marker alleles for chromosome 1 in human primary breast carcinoma. Another document talks about variation in genomic Alu repeat density as a basis for rapid construction of low-resolution physical maps of human chromosomes. Additionally, there are studies on molecular and genetic characterization and physical mapping of new markers detecting multiallele restriction fragment length polymorphisms on the short arm of human chromosome 3, and abnormal patterns of DNA methylation in human neoplasia. No information is provided about Copy Number Variants (CNVs) or regions of low mappability. Therefore, we cannot determine whether CNVs are depleted in regions of low mappability.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B: no\""]
