["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about finding therapeutic levels of Vedolizumab in breast milk. Vedolizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that interferes with the antigen-presenting process (CD4 antibody treatment in Crohn's disease). Since it does not mention anything specific about breast milk, we need to look for general information on the safety of drug therapy during pregnancy and lactation. According to 'Inflammatory bowel disease in pregnancy', corticosteroids and sulphasalazine are safe in pregnancy and are the mainstays of medical treatment. There is no mention of Vedolizumab specifically in this article, but it does not provide any contradictory information either. In 'CD4 antibody treatment in Crohn's disease' we learn about new, humanized, monoclonal antibodies that interfere with the antigen-presenting process, but there is no mention of breast milk or lactation. Therefore, based on the available information, we cannot determine whether therapeutic levels of Vedolizumab can be found in the breast milk of nursing mothers.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
