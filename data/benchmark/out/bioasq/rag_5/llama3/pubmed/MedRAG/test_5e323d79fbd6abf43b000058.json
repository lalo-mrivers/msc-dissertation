["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks if secondary glioblastoma can be caused by brain irradiation. We need to look for information on the occurrence of new intracranial metastatic sites and their relationship with primary tumor progression after radiation therapy. In the document 'Outcome and patterns of failure following limited-volume irradiation for malignant astrocytomas', it is stated that 6 patients (3 GBM, 3 AA) had evidence of a new intracranial metastatic site on CT scan. All 6 patients had evidence of progression of their primary tumor at the original location on CT scan prior to the discovery of the metastatic site. This suggests that secondary glioblastoma is not caused by brain irradiation, but rather it is a manifestation of primary tumor progression.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
