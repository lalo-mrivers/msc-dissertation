["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks whether there is high nucleotide diversity in Drosophila suzukii species. The relevant documents mention different species of Drosophila, such as Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila simulans, but not Drosophila suzukii. However, the document 'Levels of naturally occurring DNA polymorphism correlate with recombination rates in D. melanogaster' mentions that the amount of nucleotide diversity is positively correlated with the regional rate of recombination in D. melanogaster. This suggests that high nucleotide diversity might be observed in some regions of the genome, but it does not provide direct evidence about Drosophila suzukii.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
