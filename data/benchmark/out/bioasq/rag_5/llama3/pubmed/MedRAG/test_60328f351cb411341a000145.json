["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks if Freund's complete adjuvant can induce arthritis. We need to look at the relevant documents for answers. The first document talks about inducing adjuvant arthritis in mice and rats. It mentions that rats develop swollen extremities similar to those observed in rats affected by adjuvant arthritis, while mice exhibit only inflammatory pedal edema without florid arthritis. This suggests that Freund's complete adjuvant can induce arthritis, but it might not be species-specific. The second document talks about the manifestations of adjuvant arthritis in Lewis and AVN inbred strain of rats, showing that it is a specific reaction. The third document compares the efficiency of lymph node injection for the induction of adjuvant arthritis with conventional footpad injection. It shows that the lymph node route is more efficient. Finally, the fourth document talks about the persistence of antigen in nonarthritic joints, but does not directly answer the question.\n\nFrom these documents, we can conclude that Freund's complete adjuvant can induce arthritis in rats, and potentially in other species as well.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
