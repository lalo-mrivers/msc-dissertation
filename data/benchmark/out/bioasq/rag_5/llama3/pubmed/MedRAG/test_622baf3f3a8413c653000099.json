["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents mention vitamin E binding proteins in human serum, specifically alpha1-lipoproteins, which contain up to 44% of total serum vitamin E. However, none of the documents specifically mention Afamin as a protein that binds vitamin E. The document 'Binding of D-alpha-tocopherol to rat liver nuclear components' suggests that vitamin E is bound to a nucleoprotein complex in hepatic nuclei, but it does not specify which protein this binding occurs with. Therefore, based on the available information, it cannot be concluded that Afamin binds vitamin E.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
