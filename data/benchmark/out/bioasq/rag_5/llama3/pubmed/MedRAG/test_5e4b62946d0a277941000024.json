["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about Dexmecamylamine's effectiveness for depression. After reviewing the provided documents, we can see that none of them mention Dexmecamylamine or its effect on depression. The first document discusses the antidepressant effects of salbutamol, while the second and fourth documents focus on different medications (imipramine, mianserin, diazepam) and their efficacy in treating depression. The third document reports on the use of physostigmine to reverse diazepam-induced delirium or coma, but does not mention depression. Therefore, based on the available information, it is not possible to determine whether Dexmecamylamine is effective for depression.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
