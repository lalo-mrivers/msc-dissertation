["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, it can be inferred that luminopsins are a type of protein conformational change that occurs during photolysis. The document 'Transient light-induced conformational changes in rhodopsin' suggests that the unfolding of the rhodopsin molecule during photolysis up to the stage of metarhodopsin II is followed by a spontaneous refolding of the protein, which might imply a very similar conformation for rhodopsin and opsin, apart from the presence of the chromophore. This implies that luminopsins are not fusion proteins of luminol and Rhodopsin, but rather different conformations of the same protein.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
