["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about KCNT2 mutations and their relationship with epilepsy. From the provided documents, we can see that the tottering mouse has a recessively inherited, autosomal single-locus mutation (chromosome 8) which produces a characteristic neurological and cellular phenotype, including frequent episodes of absence seizures with spike-and-wave discharges. This suggests that KCNT2 mutations are related to epilepsy. However, the documents also mention other forms of generalized epilepsy that may have different genetic influences. Therefore, we cannot conclude that KCNT2 mutations only cause phenotypes with epilepsy.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
