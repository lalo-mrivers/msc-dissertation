["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking if mitochondria can transfer from cell to cell. Let's examine the documents for relevant information. The first document talks about transferring a protein synthesis defect into two mitochondrial DNA-less human cell lines with myoblasts from a patient with mitochondrial myopathy. This suggests that mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) alterations can be transferred between cells, but it does not specifically address the transfer of mitochondria themselves. The second document discusses pyruvate transport in tumour-cell mitochondria and does not provide any information relevant to the question. The third document talks about the transport of proteins synthesized in the cytoplasm into mitochondria, which is different from transferring mitochondria themselves. Finally, the fourth document discusses protein import into yeast mitochondrial matrix and a translocation intermediate between the two mitochondrial membranes. This article does not provide any information relevant to the question either. Therefore, based on the provided documents, it seems that there is no direct evidence for or against the transfer of mitochondria from cell to cell.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B: no\""]
