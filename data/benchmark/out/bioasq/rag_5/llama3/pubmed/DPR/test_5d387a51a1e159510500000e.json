["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question does not provide any relevant information about CXorf21 or X chromosome inactivation. Therefore, I will rely on my general medical knowledge to answer the question. Based on my understanding of X chromosome inactivation, I will assume that it refers to the process by which one of the two X chromosomes in female mammals is randomly inactivated in each cell. If this is correct, then CXorf21 would be subject to X chromosome inactivation unless there is some specific mechanism allowing it to escape.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
