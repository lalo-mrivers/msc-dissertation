["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"This question is related to genetics and epigenetics. Epigenetic changes refer to modifications that can affect gene expression without altering the DNA sequence itself. Heritability refers to the ability of a trait or characteristic to be passed down from one generation to another. Since epigenetic changes do not involve changes in the DNA sequence, they are unlikely to be heritable in the classical sense. However, some studies have shown that epigenetic marks can be inherited through mechanisms such as parental care and environmental factors.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
