["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about circular RNA (circRNA) produced by back splicing. CircRNAs are formed when a region of an intron or exon is spliced to another region within the same gene, resulting in a covalently closed loop. The relevant documents do not provide direct information on circRNA production mechanisms. However, we can consider the characteristics of AT-rich repeat-containing genes, which are known to produce circRNAs through back splicing. The question does not specify any particular gene or context, so we cannot make a definitive statement about the origin of circRNA. Therefore, our answer must be based on general knowledge.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B: no\"\n}"]
