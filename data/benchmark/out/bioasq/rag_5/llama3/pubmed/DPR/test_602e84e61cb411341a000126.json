["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks if Tocilizumab (Actemra) is used to block/antagonize the IL-6 receptor. In one of the provided documents, it states that interleukin-6 (IL-6) stimulates ovarian cancer cell growth. Further investigation reveals that this document does not mention Tocilizumab or Actemra. However, another document discusses the expression of adhesion molecules in human skin following intradermal injection of stratum corneum-derived IL-1 alpha. This suggests a connection between IL-6 and its receptor. Therefore, it can be inferred that Tocilizumab (Actemra) is used to block/antagonize the IL-6 receptor.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
