["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"After reviewing the provided documents, it is clear that none of them mention Groucho related gene 5 (GRG5) or its role in development. Therefore, I must rely on general knowledge and research to answer this question. GRG5 is a protein-coding gene involved in various cellular processes, including cytoskeleton dynamics and cell adhesion. While it is not explicitly stated whether GRG5 has a specific role in late development, general information suggests that it may be more active during embryonic development and early childhood.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B: no\"}"]
