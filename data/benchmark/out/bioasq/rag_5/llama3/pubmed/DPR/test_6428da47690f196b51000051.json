["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about whether epigenetic status of introns can affect gene expression. Introns are non-coding regions of DNA, so their epigenetic status might have an impact on the surrounding coding regions or regulatory elements. Some studies suggest that epigenetic marks in introns can influence gene expression by modulating transcriptional elongation, splicing, and mRNA stability. However, this relationship is still not fully understood and requires further research. Nevertheless, based on current knowledge, it appears that the epigenetic status of introns can indeed affect gene expression.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
