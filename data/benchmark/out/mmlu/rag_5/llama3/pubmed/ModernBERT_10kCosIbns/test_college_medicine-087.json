["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking what our genetic material is made up of. We can look at the relevant documents to find the answer. From [Current problems of molecular genetics], we know that a special attention is paid to enzymology of genetic processes, in particular, to the mechanism of DNA replication. This suggests that DNA might be related to our genetic material. In [Recent advances in genetics], it is mentioned that the Human Genome Project aims to map and eventually sequence the entire human genome, which is made up of 3 billion nucleotide bases. This also supports the idea that DNA might be our genetic material. Finally, in [DNA technology], we see that diseases can now be studied and treated at a molecular level using DNA sequencing techniques, further supporting the idea that DNA is our genetic material.\",\n\"answer_choice\": A"]
