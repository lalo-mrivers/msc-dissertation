["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe fertilization processes, including human IVF. However, the question specifically asks about double fertilization in flowering plants. The text does not provide detailed information on this process, but it mentions that sperm faces problems in transport and interaction with the egg during fertilization. This suggests that there may be a specific mechanism for sperm-egg fusion. In Drosophila, both cell-autonomous genetic information and inductive somatic signals contribute to ensure that germ cells are oogenic or spermatogenic. This implies that the mechanisms controlling sex determination may also influence the process of double fertilization. Finally, the text highlights the complexity of fertilization processes, mentioning premature chromosome condensation of spermatozoa (PCC) as an example of a failure in fertilization. However, PCC is not directly related to double fertilization.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
