["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about embryonic cleavage. We have documents related to human pre-embryos, gene activity, and developmental stages of human embryos. From the 'Gene activity and cleavage arrest in human pre-embryos' document, we can learn that spontaneous cleavage arrest occurs around the four- to eight-cell stage of human development. The 'Developmental stages of human embryos' document provides information on the embryonic period divided into eight main stages. Based on this information, we can conclude that cleavage is a process that occurs during early developmental stages.\n\nFrom the 'Evaluation of the synchronism of cleavage divisions' document, we learn about estimating the degree of asynchronism of cell divisions in individual embryos at early developmental stages. This suggests that cleavage is not a uniform process and may occur asynchronously.\n\nThe 'Early human development and the chief sources of information on staged human embryos' document provides information on the Carnegie system of 23 stages for the embryonic period proper, which includes the early stages where cleavage occurs.\n\nConsidering these points, we can assess each option:\n\nOption A: The presence of yolk inhibits cleavage. This is not supported by our documents, as they do not mention a relationship between yolk and cleavage.\n\nOption B: Telolecithal eggs undergo meroblastic cleavage. Our documents do not discuss telolecithal eggs or meroblastic cleavage.\n\nOption C: The vegetal pole undergoes cleavage more readily than does the animal pole. Our documents do not provide information on the poles or their relative rates of cleavage.\n\nOption D: The rapid mitotic divisions of cleavage directly give rise to blastomeres. This statement is supported by our documents, as they describe cleavage as a process that occurs during early developmental stages and is characterized by rapid mitotic divisions giving rise to blastomeres.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
