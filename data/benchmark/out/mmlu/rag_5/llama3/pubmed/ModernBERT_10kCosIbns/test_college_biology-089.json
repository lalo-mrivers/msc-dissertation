["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is related to the theory of starch granules being released from rye grass pollen due to osmotic shock after exposure to water. The correct statement must be one that describes the state of the pollen grains' interior. We can find this information in the paper 'Two consecutive thunderstorm associated epidemics of asthma in the city of Melbourne'. According to the study, patients affected by the second storm were significantly more likely to suffer from rye grass pollen allergy (P < 0.05). This suggests that rye grass pollen is involved in the asthma attacks. Additionally, the paper 'Fungal and actinomycete spore aerosols measured at different humidities with an aerodynamic particle sizer' discusses the physical behavior of airborne spores and particle deposition sites in the lung. Although this paper does not directly relate to the theory, it provides information on the size and physical properties of particles that can enter the lower airways. In contrast, the papers 'Childhood asthma and grass pollen aerobiology in Melbourne' and 'Bronchial asthma in the Nigerian savanna region' do not provide relevant information for this question.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
