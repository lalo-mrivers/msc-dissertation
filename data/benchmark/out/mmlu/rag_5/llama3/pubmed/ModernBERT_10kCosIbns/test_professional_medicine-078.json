["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To calculate the sensitivity of this test, we need to know how many true positives there are (i.e., men with a positive test result who actually have prostate cancer) and how many people were tested. We also need to know how many false negatives there are (i.e., men with a negative test result who actually have prostate cancer). This information is not provided in the question, but we can infer that all men with serum PSA concentrations greater than 5 ng/mL underwent biopsy procedures. Therefore, we can assume that all positive tests corresponded to actual cases of prostate cancer.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
