["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant document for this question is 'Neurophysiological experiments on intention tremor (author's transl)'. According to the document, during a postural innervation, cerebellar intention tremor can be produced by applying direct stimulus to the muscle. The spindle apparatus seems irrelevant to the development of intention tremor. There is no silent period in the shortened muscle, no rebound in the stretched muscle, and consequently little or no oscillation follows.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
