["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about which option is true. None of the provided documents are related to sports medicine or muscle growth, so we must carefully read each document to find a connection. The first document talks about teaching statistics to health professionals and uses an analogy with criminal legal trials. It does not mention anything about muscle growth or strength. The second document discusses the difference between explaining and understanding in science, but it is not relevant to this question. The third document explores Jewish theology and bioethics, which has no connection to the topic of muscle growth or supplements. The fourth document talks about the doctrine of double effect in ethics, which is also not relevant. Based on the documents provided, there is no clear connection between any of the topics discussed and the options presented. Therefore, we must look at each option individually and eliminate those that are clearly false.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
