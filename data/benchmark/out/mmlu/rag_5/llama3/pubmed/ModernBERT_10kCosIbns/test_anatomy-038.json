["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the walls of bronchioles. The relevant documents describe the ultrastructure of small bronchi and bronchioli, but we're looking for information specifically on bronchioles. The document 'Surface forces in respiratory bronchioles during a first breath-model experiment' discusses the air-liquid interface descending through terminal bronchioles, which indicates that terminal bronchioles have a ciliated cylindrical epithelium without goblet cells, possessing rare Clara cells. The same document also describes the presence of small membranous pneumocytes in islets and cubical cells. This information suggests that the walls of bronchioles contain respiratory epithelium, Clara cells, and possibly other cell types like membranous pneumocytes.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
