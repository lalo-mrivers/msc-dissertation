["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the spheno-occipital synchondrosis. The relevant documents mention cartilage canals in the human spheno-occipital synchondrosis during fetal life. Cartilage canals were present in all seven specimens over 110 mm CRL. With age, the canals grew longer and wider, and the larger ones developed some branching. It was suggested that the canals, containing blood vessels and connective tissue elements, actively invade the cartilage of the synchondrosis. This suggests that the spheno-occipital synchondrosis is a site of active growth and development during fetal life.\",\n\"answer_choice\": A"]
