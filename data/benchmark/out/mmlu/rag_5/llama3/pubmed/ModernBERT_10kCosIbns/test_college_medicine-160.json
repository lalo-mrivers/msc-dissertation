["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the structure of DNA, including the hydrogen bonds between nucleotide bases functioning as informational gates. The genetic code is fixed by triplets of nucleotide bases, which determine amino acids. None of the options mention purines or pyrimidines as not forming part of DNA. Deoxyribose is a sugar residue present in DNA strands. Amino acid fixation is determined by triplet nucleotide base codes. Therefore, none of the options fit the description.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
