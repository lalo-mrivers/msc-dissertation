["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant document for this question is the Human genome protein function database. According to this database, proteins are categorized based on their biomedical functions. This suggests that a large portion of the human genome does not encode proteins. Therefore, the fraction of the human genome encoding proteins will likely be less than 50%. The Stein and Moore Award address also mentions that many mainstream metabolic enzymes, for example, are 40-50% identical in prokaryotes and eukaryotes, groups that diverged from a common ancestor more than 1.5 billion years ago. This suggests that the rate of change of amino acid sequence varies greatly from protein to protein. A comprehensive examination of protein sequences for evidence of internal gene duplication also found that some superfamilies contain proteins with internal gene duplications. Therefore, it is likely that not all parts of the genome are coding for proteins.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B: 25%\""]
