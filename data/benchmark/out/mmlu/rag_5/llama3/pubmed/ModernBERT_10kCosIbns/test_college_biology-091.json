["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Phalloidin is a toxin that binds to actin subunits and disrupts actin function. The documents describe phalloidin-induced actin polymerization in the cytoplasm of cultured cells, which interferes with cell locomotion and growth. Phalloidin also stabilizes preexisting thick bundles of microfilaments (stress fibers) but does not affect the pattern of cytoplasmic microtubules. Therefore, the structure most directly affected by phalloidin would be the microfilaments.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
