["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the maintenance of adequate serum levels of calcium in humans. The relevant documents describe various mechanisms that regulate calcium metabolism, including the synthesis and secretion of parathyroid hormone (PTH). PTH is known to play a central role in maintaining serum concentrations of total and ionized calcium within narrowly defined limits. This suggests that PTH is likely involved in the maintenance of adequate serum levels of calcium.\", \"answer_choice\": D}"]
