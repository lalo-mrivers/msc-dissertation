["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents provide information on the risk of miscarriage associated with amniocentesis. In the first document, it is mentioned that three women had a miscarriage following amniocentesis up to 6 weeks afterwards. This suggests a risk of around 1 in 70 (3 out of 212 cases). The second document does not provide any specific information on the risk of miscarriage. The third document mentions that there were no major complications and one minor complication, but it does not specify if this includes miscarriages. The fourth document provides more detailed information on the risk of miscarriage, specifically stating that two women had spontaneous abortions, which could be related to the procedure. This suggests a risk of around 1 in 90 (2 out of 1812 cases). Taking these findings into account, it appears that the overall risk of miscarriage associated with amniocentesis is relatively low.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
