["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the descendants of plant hybrids that have spontaneously doubled their chromosome number. We can look at the relevant documents to understand what happens when there's a change in chromosome conformation during gametogenesis, which is greater in sex chromosomes than autosomes and in heterogametic than homogametic sex. This suggests that the sensitivity of hybrids to genetic divergence is partly due to the failure of their sex chromosomes to undergo appropriate conformational changes. Since doubling the chromosome number would mean an increase in the amount of genetic material, it's likely that this change could help the descendants pair normally and reproduce sexually.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
