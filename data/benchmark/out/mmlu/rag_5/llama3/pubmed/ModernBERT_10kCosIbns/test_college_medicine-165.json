["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the free energy contained in FADH2 and NADH+H. Both FADH2 and NADH+H are high-energy molecules that can be used to generate ATP through cellular respiration. FADH2 contains enough energy to generate 1-2 ATP, while NADH+H contains enough energy to generate 2.5-3 ATP. Therefore, the total free energy contained in FADH2 and NADH+H is sufficient to rephosphorylate 4 ATP molecules.\", \"answer_choice\": C}"]
