["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the characteristics of the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) technique. The relevant documents describe PCR as a method that amplifies specific DNA sequences using short DNA primers and a thermostable DNA polymerase in vitro. This information can be found in multiple documents, including 'The polymerase chain reaction. History, methods, and applications', 'Polymerase chain reaction: general methodology', and 'The polymerase chain reaction and related techniques'. According to these documents, PCR uses short DNA primers and a thermostable DNA polymerase to replicate specific DNA sequences in vitro.\", \"answer_choice\": C}"]
