["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the relationship between p53 gene mutation and cell cycle arrest. Since the patient's tumor cells contain a point mutation in the p53 gene leading to an inactive gene product, this suggests that the p53 pathway is impaired. The p53 protein plays a crucial role in inducing cell cycle arrest at the G1/S checkpoint in response to DNA damage. With an inactive p53 protein, the cells may not be able to arrest their cell cycle effectively, allowing them to continue proliferating despite irradiation therapy. Therefore, the progressive tumor growth is likely due to a defect in cell cycle arrest during the G1 phase.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
