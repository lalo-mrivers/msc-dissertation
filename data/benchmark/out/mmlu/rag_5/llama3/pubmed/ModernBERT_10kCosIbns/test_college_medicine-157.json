The options present three scenarios: a monkey learning from another monkey, a child learning baseball rules from a parent, and new recruits in a military organization experiencing hazing rituals.\n\nThe first option is a case of observational learning, where the younger monkey learns by observing the older monkey's behavior. This does not involve symbolic culture.\n\nThe second option involves the transmission of knowledge through cultural norms, as the child learns the rules of baseball from their parent. Baseball is a human-made game with its own set of rules and norms.\n\nThe third option also involves the transmission of knowledge through cultural norms, as the new recruits learn hazing rituals from older students. This scenario does involve symbolic culture.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is I only.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
