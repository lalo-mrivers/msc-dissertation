["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the rate limiting enzyme of glycolysis. Glycolysis is a biochemical oscillator that can be described by a set of coupled nonlinear differential equations of first order with respect to time. The outcomes of a simplified model show good agreements with experimental results. Phosphofructokinase (PFK) plays a crucial role in the feedback control of glycolysis and is able to oscillate due to the feedback control of PFK by the adenylates. This suggests that phosphofructokinase may be the rate limiting enzyme of glycolysis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
