["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient had a grease gun injury with hot grease spilled on her left leg. The wound is pink, soft, granular, edematous, which suggests an inflammatory response and tissue reaction to the foreign substance. The relevant document discusses the pathomorphological alterations in grease gun injuries, including the development of epithelioid cell-like granulation tissue and histiocytic cell infiltrations. This cellular metamorphosis is based on the action of long-chain fatty acids. The wound resembles a chronic stage of a grease gun injury, which would be characterized by granulating inflammation and scar tissue formation. Increased activity of enzymes like stromelysin could contribute to the tissue response in this scenario.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
