["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, we need to understand how blood lactate concentration changes during exercise. From the document 'Activity profile of competition soccer', we see that there is a significant correlation between high intensity running and blood lactate values. This suggests that as players become more fatigued during the game, their blood lactate concentration will increase. Additionally, from the document 'Blood lactate concentration following intermittent and continuous cycling tests of anaerobic capacity', we see that the mode of testing affects the magnitude and time of peak blood lactate concentration. Since soccer is a high-intensity sport, it is likely that players' blood lactate concentrations will increase throughout the course of the game as they become more fatigued. Therefore, option D seems to be the most accurate.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
