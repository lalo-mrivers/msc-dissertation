["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the postnatal growth of the maxilla. We can find relevant information by looking at the documents provided. The first document talks about prenatal growth patterns of the human maxilla and suggests that the primary growth centers which demarcate the maxillary trapezoid are the basic structures of the developing human maxilla. This information is not directly related to postnatal growth, but it gives us an idea about the formation of the maxilla during fetal development. The second document talks about the influence of teeth loss on morphometric characteristics of the maxilla and suggests that reabsorption of bones occurs due to change in biomechanical conditions and interaction of forces caused by the loss of teeth. This information is not directly related to postnatal growth either. The third document discusses rapid maxillary expansion procedures and how they affect the skeletal alterations induced by these procedures. Although this document talks about the maxilla, it does not provide information about postnatal growth. The fourth document describes a technique for producing teaching models of the maxillary sinus and talks about anatomical variation in the shape and size of the maxillary sinus. This information is also not directly related to postnatal growth. The fifth document discusses panoramic roentgen anatomy of the maxillary sinus, which does not provide any information about postnatal growth either.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
