["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the cellular activities of glycolytic enzymes during growth and tissue differentiation. The paper on cellular differentiation mentions that the microcompartmentation of glycolysis occurs during this process, suggesting that the enzymes are located in a specific region or compartment within the cell. This is further supported by the discussion of the modular, biphasic model of glycolytic activity, which implies that the enzymes are organized into distinct modules or compartments.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
