["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about ulnar nerve palsy. We need to look for relevant information from the provided documents. The first document talks about low ulnar nerve palsy, but it doesn't mention the specific symptoms of the palsy. The second document discusses VIth nerve palsy (which is different from ulnar nerve palsy), so we can rule that out. The third and fourth documents discuss traumatic ulnar palsy and pressure palsy of the ulnar nerve with prolonged conduction block, but they don't provide information on the specific symptoms or effects of ulnar nerve palsy.

Ulnar nerve palsy typically affects the little finger and half of the ring finger, leading to loss of sensation and motor weakness.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
