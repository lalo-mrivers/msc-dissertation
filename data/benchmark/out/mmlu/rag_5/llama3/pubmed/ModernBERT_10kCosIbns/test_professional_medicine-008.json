["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about evaluating the most appropriate lymph nodes for evidence of metastasis in a patient with squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue. From the provided documents, it can be seen that recurrent cancer of the neck was observed in four patients (Squamous cell carcinoma of the oral tongue). It is mentioned that prophylactic treatment of the neck should be undertaken in stage II patients because of the high incidence of occult metastases. This suggests that cervical lymph nodes are at risk of harboring metastatic disease. The size of the primary lesion does not play a substantial role in local control, but it can affect overall survival (Surgical treatment of squamous cell carcinoma of the oral tongue). Therefore, the most appropriate lymph nodes to evaluate for evidence of metastasis would be those in the neck region.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
