["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to 'The course, relations and distribution of the inferior alveolar nerve and its branches in the cat', the inferior alveolar nerve has three main branches: alveolar branches that supply the alveolar process, a canine/incisor branch that supplies the canine and incisor region, and four mental branches (posterior, main, and two anterior). Fibres supplying the teeth were found in all except the mental branches. Pulpal, periodontal, and buccal gingival margin fibres from an individual tooth generally travelled together, but often in more than one branch. This information suggests that the inferior alveolar nerve supplies the mandibular teeth and labial gingivae of the anterior mandibular teeth.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
