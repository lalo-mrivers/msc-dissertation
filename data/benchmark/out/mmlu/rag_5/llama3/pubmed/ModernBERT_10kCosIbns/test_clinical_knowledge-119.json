["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, there is no direct information that explicitly states which signs and symptoms are indicative of circulatory overload. However, we can make an educated inference by considering the general principles of circulatory control and the characteristics of circulatory insufficiency. The document [Integration and control of circulatory function] highlights the importance of intrinsic controls in maintaining stable long-term circulation, whereas extrinsic controls (nervous and hormonal) play a crucial role in acute arterial pressure control and fluid balance regulation. This suggests that signs of circulatory overload may be related to excessive fluid accumulation or increased peripheral resistance.\n\nFurthermore, [Fast diagnosis of hemodynamic disorders in patients with heart disease] discusses the importance of central venous pressure as an informative parameter for diagnosing blood volume disorders combined with cardiac failure. This implies that changes in central venous pressure might be indicative of circulatory overload.\n\nBased on these observations, I will consider the options provided and eliminate those that are unlikely to be related to circulatory overload. Option A (Hypothermia, hypotension, and bradycardia) is more characteristic of circulatory insufficiency rather than overload. Options B and C seem unrelated to circulatory overload.\n\nOption D (Dyspnoea, tachycardia, and distended neck veins) appears to be the most relevant option. Dyspnoea and tachycardia are common symptoms of cardiac failure or fluid overload, whereas distended neck veins can indicate increased central venous pressure. These signs are more indicative of circulatory overload than insufficiency.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
