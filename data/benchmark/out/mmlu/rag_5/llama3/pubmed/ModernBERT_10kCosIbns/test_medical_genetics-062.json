["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks for the likelihood of an individual carrying two specific alleles, each with a frequency of 0.2. This is a problem of probability estimation. The relevant document is 'Unique' alleles in admixed populations: a strategy for determining 'hereditary' population differences of disease frequencies, which discusses the concept of unique alleles and their frequencies in parental and admixed populations. However, this document does not provide a direct answer to this question. The closest relevant information can be found in 'Human population genetic studies using hypervariable loci.' This study shows that the frequency of an allele is a measure of its relative frequency in a population. In our case, each allele has a frequency of 0.2, which means the probability of an individual carrying one specific allele is also 0.2. Since we are looking for the likelihood of carrying two specific alleles, we need to consider the probability of both events occurring independently. This can be calculated by multiplying the probabilities: 0.2 * 0.2 = 0.04.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: 0.02\"\n}"]
