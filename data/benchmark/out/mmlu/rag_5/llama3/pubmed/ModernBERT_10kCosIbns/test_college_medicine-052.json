["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, we need to convert the athlete's oxygen uptake from liters per minute (L/min) to milliliters per minute (mL/min). 1 L = 1000 mL, so 3.0 L/min is equivalent to 3000 mL/min. Next, we multiply this value by the exercise duration in minutes (5 minutes), which gives us the total oxygen uptake in milliliters. Finally, we use the equation for energy expenditure from oxygen consumption: energy expenditure (in kJ) = 21.13 x oxygen uptake (in mL).\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
