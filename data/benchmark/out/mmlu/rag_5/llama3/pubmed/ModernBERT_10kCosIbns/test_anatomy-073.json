["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about an unfavourable fracture of the body of the mandible. We know that the mandible has different muscles attached to it, such as the digastric, lateral pterygoid, temporalis and medial pterygoid muscles. These muscles have specific actions on the mandible. For example, the digastric muscle pulls the mandible downwards, while the lateral pterygoid muscle pulls the condyle backwards. The temporalis muscle is responsible for elevating the mandible. Therefore, considering these muscle actions and the fact that we are dealing with an unfavourable fracture of the body of the mandible, we can deduce which fragment would be displaced.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
