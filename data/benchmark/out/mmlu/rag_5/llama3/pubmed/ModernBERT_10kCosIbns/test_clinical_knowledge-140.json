["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, we can infer that controlled drugs are those regulated by international conventions such as the Convention on Psychotropic Substances, 1971. The classification of drugs according to present international conventions and Danish legislation also suggests that controlled drugs are those classified under these conventions. Furthermore, the fact that the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) in the United States aims to control drug use's 'substantial and detrimental effect on the health and general welfare' implies that controlled drugs are those subject to this act.\n\nNow, let's examine the given options: A 30 milligram ampoule of Codeine Phosphate for injection is a controlled drug as it contains codeine, which is a narcotic under international conventions. B Sustained release Morphine tablet is also a controlled drug as morphine is a psychotropic substance regulated by the Convention on Psychotropic Substances, 1971. C A 12.5 microgram Fentanyl patch is a controlled drug as fentanyl is a synthetic analog of morphine and is subject to international control.\n\nHowever, D A 500 ml bottle of Morphine 10 mg in 5 ml in oral suspension does not seem to be a controlled drug based on the provided information.
