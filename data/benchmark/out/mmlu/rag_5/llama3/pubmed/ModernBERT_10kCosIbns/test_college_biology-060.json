["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the formation of the earliest cells. The relevant documents discuss the origins of the first cell and the emergence of life. According to the model proposed, proteins had to have been first informational macromolecules that were necessary and sufficient to lead to the emergence of life. This suggests that proteins may have arisen before nucleic acids. Additionally, the document 'Mechanisms of competency of early embryonic tissues' discusses the development of epidermis from ectoderm and the role of cell surface, adhesion, and cell affinity in early development, which further supports the idea that protein-based components may have emerged first.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
