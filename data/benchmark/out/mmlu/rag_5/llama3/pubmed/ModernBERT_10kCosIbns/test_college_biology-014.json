["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Comparing the relevant documents, we can see that Archaea and Eukarya share many basic features of their genetic machinery and central metabolism. This suggests a common ancestor. Additionally, at least one member of Archaea has proteins similar to TBP and TFIIB, which are used by Eukarya in transcription. This implies that Archaea may have evolved from a common ancestor with Eukarya. The observation that Bacteria do not use these general transcription factors further supports this scenario.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
