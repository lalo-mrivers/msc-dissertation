["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents discuss various aspects of respiratory system reactions, including lung ventilation, diaphragmal motoneurons, intercostal muscles, intrathoracic pressure, inspiratory occlusional pressure, and maximal rate of the initial increase in inspiratory pressure. The study on breath rate as a function of parameters of pulmonary function in body plethysmography mentions that in subjects with normal pulmonary function, resistance increased significantly by 25 and 45 percent at more rapid respiration rates (20-40/min). However, it is noted that this rarely accounts for false interpretations in everyday routine practice. The study also concludes that ventilation work of breathing and the index of ventilation work of breathing show a close correlation to breathing rate in all groups. No relationship of breathing rate to respiratory passage resistance was observed in patients with increased total resistance.\n\nThe modified measurement of respiratory resistance by forced oscillation during normal breathing method measures Rrs, which may be measured during slow or rapid spontaneous breathing, in normals and in obstructive patients, over a range of 3-9 Hz. Frequency dependence of Rrs was found in patients with obstructive lung disease but not in healthy nonsmokers.\n\nThe study on duration of respiratory periods of uniform respiratory rhythms in 35 patients with neurosurgical diseases shows that the mean duration of respiratory periods was between 8.60 and 71.51 seconds, increasing with age. There is no correlation between acid-base values, blood gas values, and the duration of respiratory periods.\n\nThe study on variability of the respiratory phase, respiratory pause, and numbers and durations of respirations during periodic breathing shows wide variability of mean values of respiratory phases, shorter respiratory pauses, and a very small scatter for single respirations. The respiratory rate in 32 out of 35 patients was higher than normal and is to be considered as tachypnoea.\n\nConsidering the above information, we can conclude that there is no specific mention of the normal respiratory rate for an adult male in any of these studies. However, it is mentioned that in healthy humans, lung ventilation, activity of diaphragmal motoneurons, and intercostal muscles were studied at resting breathing rates (mean 15-17/min). This suggests that a normal respiratory rate for an adult male may be around 16 breaths per minute.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: 14-16 breaths per minute.\""]
