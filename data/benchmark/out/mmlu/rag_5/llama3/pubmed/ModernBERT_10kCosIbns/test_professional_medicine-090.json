["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with a 1-week history of nasal stuffiness, occasional clear rhinorrhea, and a mild sore throat. She has no history of allergies, is not a smoker, and has unremarkable medical history. The physical examination reveals tenderness over the left maxillary sinus without purulent drainage, enlarged tonsils bilaterally, and pain with tapping of the left upper incisors. Left frontal sinus does not transilluminate. Based on the symptoms and physical examination findings, chronic sinusitis is a possible diagnosis. The patient's age, lack of allergies, and absence of smoking also suggest a more likely cause of chronic rather than acute sinusitis. Considering the patient's history of oral contraceptive use, it is unlikely to be a contributing factor in this case. Therefore, the most likely underlying mechanism of this patient's sinusitis is mucosal edema.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
