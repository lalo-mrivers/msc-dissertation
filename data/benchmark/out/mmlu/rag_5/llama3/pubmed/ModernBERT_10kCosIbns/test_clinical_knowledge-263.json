["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Phosphocreatine is a molecule that plays a role in energy metabolism. It is involved in protein phosphorylation and has membranotropic effects on cell membranes. It also affects the activity of certain enzymes such as pyruvate kinase. Phosphocreatine can be found in the cytoplasm, sarcolemma, and possibly other subcellular compartments. However, there is no mention of it being present in the mitochondria or having a specific function related to mitochondrial energy metabolism.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
