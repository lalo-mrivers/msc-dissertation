["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant document is 'Exercise: Part II. Translating the exercise prescription'. According to this document, it states that as intensity exceeds the anaerobic threshold, anaerobic glycolysis is inhibited, forcing a decrease in exercise intensity. This implies that at higher intensities, there is a greater proportional contribution of aerobic energy production.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
