["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe glucose transport into muscle cells primarily through facilitated diffusion mediated by GLUT1 and GLUT4 glucose transporters. The study also shows that exercise training can result in increased rates of insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in skeletal muscle, with the total number of skeletal-muscle plasma-membrane glucose transporters (R0), total muscle-homogenate and plasma-membrane GLUT4 protein, and rates of plasma-membrane vesicle D-facilitated glucose transport being higher in exercise-trained rats immediately after exercise training. Additionally, insulin administration results in translocation of glucose transporters from the microsomal-membrane fraction to the plasma membrane and an increase in the carrier-turnover number.\",\n\"answer_choice\": A"]
