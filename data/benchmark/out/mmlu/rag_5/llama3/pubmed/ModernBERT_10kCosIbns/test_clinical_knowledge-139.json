["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the 'normal' range of flexion at the knee joint. Let's look at the available documents. The [Spatial kinematics of the femoro-tibial articulation of the human knee: experimental characterization and surgical implication] study mentions that the entire flexion of the human knee joint was experimentally studied by means of spatial solid kinematic theory. This study used postmortem joints, initially intact, then with the menisci removed, and finally without the antero-external cruciate ligament. However, it does not provide a specific range of flexion.\n\nThe [Maximum isometric knee flexor and extensor muscle contractions: normal patterns of torque versus time] study mentions that isometric torque of the knee flexor and extensor muscles were recorded for 5 seconds at three knee joint positions, including 60 degrees for the extensor muscles and 45 degrees for the flexor muscles. However, it does not provide a range of flexion either.\n\nThe [Osteoarthritis of the knee: effects on gait, strength, and flexibility] study mentions that patients with symptomatic OA of the knee have poorer flexibility in both the affected and unaffected legs and demonstrate significantly less knee angular velocity and, to a lesser extent, knee range of motion during gait. However, it does not provide a specific range of flexion.\n\nThe [The intact, injured and repaired knee: in-vitro experimental biomechanics and level walking] study mentions that the simulator of joint flexion was built: it was composed of a hydraulic universal testing machine which allowed the main flexion-extension of the knee joint. However, it does not provide a specific range of flexion either.\n\nBased on the available documents, we cannot find a specific range of flexion mentioned.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
