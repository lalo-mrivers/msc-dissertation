["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the fluid that encases embryos of terrestrial vertebrates. The relevant documents discuss different groups of organisms, physiological traits, and morphological patterns, but none of them specifically mention the topic of this question. However, I can look for information related to embryonic development in the documents. In [Mechanical stresses and morphological patterns in amphibian embryos], it is mentioned that embryos have been dissected and shape alterations were studied. This suggests that there might be some sort of fluid or medium surrounding the embryo. Further investigation reveals that the document [Life and environment: from aquatic animals to terrestrial animals and to man] discusses physiological traits common to all terrestrial animals, including those related to environmental characteristics. It is likely that these traits include adaptations for preventing desiccation and injury, which would require a fluid-like substance to surround the embryo.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
