["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents provide information on the characteristics of angiosperms and gymnosperms. From the first document, it is mentioned that the genealogical splitting of gymnosperm and angiosperm lineages occurred before the early Carboniferous, which suggests that the two groups have distinct evolutionary histories. The second document provides a detailed analysis of rRNA sequence comparisons between angiosperms and gymnosperms. According to this study, the divergence of all main groups of extant gymnosperms occurred after the branching off of the angiosperm lineage. This implies that angiosperms are more closely related to each other than they are to gymnosperms.\n\nFrom these findings, it can be inferred that one characteristic that distinguishes angiosperms from gymnosperms is the enclosure of seeds within ovaries. Gymnosperms, on the other hand, produce seeds that are not enclosed in ovaries.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
