["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the provided documents, we can see that bacteriophage T4 has a genome size of 5,000 bp. A restriction enzyme recognizes a specific 4 base sequence in DNA and cleaves it at this site. We know from the document 'Cleavage of Nonglucosylated Bacteriophage T4 deoxyribonucleic acid by Restriction Endonuclease Eco RI' that Eco RI produces approximately 40 specific fragments from Glc- DNA ranging in molecular weights from 0.3 to 10.5 X 10^-6. Since we are dealing with a genome size of 5,000 bp and the restriction enzyme recognizes a specific 4 base sequence, we can expect the number of fragments to be less than 40.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B: about 4\"\n}"]
