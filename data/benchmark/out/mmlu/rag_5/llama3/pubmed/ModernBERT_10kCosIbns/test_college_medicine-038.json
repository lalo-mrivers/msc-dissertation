["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks what process of muscle contraction requires ATP besides the power stroke. The power stroke is described as a shortening process where myosin crossbridges slide along actin filaments by 12 nm in one cycle, which is believed to be coupled to the hydrolysis of one molecule of ATP. Therefore, we are looking for another process that also requires ATP. We can see from the provided documents that the contraction velocity and ATPase rate depend on the concentration of ATP, suggesting that some process consumes ATP during muscle contraction.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
