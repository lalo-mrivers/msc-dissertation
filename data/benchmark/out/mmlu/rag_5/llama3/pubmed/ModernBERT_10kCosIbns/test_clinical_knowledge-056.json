["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the effects of creatine supplementation on normal subjects. According to 'Elevation of creatine in resting and exercised muscle of normal subjects by creatine supplementation', low doses (1g or less) produced a modest rise in plasma creatine concentration, whereas 5g resulted in a mean peak after 1h of 795 mumol/l in three subjects weighing 76-87 kg. The same document states that supplementation with 5g of creatine monohydrate, four or six times a day for 2 or more days resulted in a significant increase in the total creatine content of the quadriceps femoris muscle measured in 17 subjects. No mention is made of side effects such as muscle weakness, gain in body mass, muscle cramps, or loss of electrolytes.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
