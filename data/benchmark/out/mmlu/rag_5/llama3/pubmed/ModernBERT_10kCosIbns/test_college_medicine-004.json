["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the acceleration required for the car to reach a velocity of 130 km/h. Since the distance is 50m, we can use the equation: Δv = √(2aΔx), where Δv is the change in velocity (130-0 = 130 km/h), a is the acceleration, and Δx is the distance (50m). Rearranging the equation to solve for a, we get: a = (√(2 * 130/50))^-2. This gives us an acceleration of approximately 26 m/s^2.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
