["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the organization of repetitive DNA sequences in the human genome. The presence of two repetitive DNA fractions, fast and slow intermediate DNA, is mentioned. Slow intermediate DNA sequences are finely interspersed with non-repetitive sequences, while fast intermediate DNA sequences are clustered in fragments greater than 24,000 nucleotide pairs or spaced with longer more complex sequences. The analysis also suggests that a great amount of the repetitive DNA sequence transcripts in heterogeneous nuclear RNA of HeLa cells are complementary to slow intermediate DNA sequences. These findings suggest that mobile regions of DNA capable of inserting themselves into an existing genome may be related to transposons, which are known to insert themselves into different positions within a genome.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
