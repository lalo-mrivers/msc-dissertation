["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the likelihood of an enzyme's activity being constant over a broad range of pH values. Since the activity is constant, it implies that there are no significant changes in the enzyme's structure or function due to pH changes. This suggests that any ionizing groups on the enzyme are not participating significantly in the reaction. Therefore, we can deduce that\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
