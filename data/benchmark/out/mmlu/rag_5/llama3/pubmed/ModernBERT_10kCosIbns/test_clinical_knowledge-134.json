["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents discuss the biomechanics of the normal and prosthetic knee joint.

The menisci increase the femorotibial contact area, thereby relieving some pressure. This information suggests that the knee joint is not a ball and socket joint due to its unique kinetics and instability.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
