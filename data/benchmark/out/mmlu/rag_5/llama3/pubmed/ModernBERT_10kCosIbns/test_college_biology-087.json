["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the relationship between sexual dimorphism and competition among primates. The provided documents discuss prosimian primates, sex determination mechanisms, and phylogenetic adaptation. Among prosimian primates, some species show significant differences in body weight between males and females, while others do not. The document suggests that this variability may be related to selective forces affecting male and female behavioral strategies. This information implies that intense competition for mates or resources is likely among primates that exhibit high sexual dimorphism, as it favors the most viable individuals.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
