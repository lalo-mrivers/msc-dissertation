["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The study reports the results of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial evaluating the effectiveness of a new drug for treating common cold.

Considering this, the clinically significance of these results is questionable.\", \"answer_choice\": B}"]
