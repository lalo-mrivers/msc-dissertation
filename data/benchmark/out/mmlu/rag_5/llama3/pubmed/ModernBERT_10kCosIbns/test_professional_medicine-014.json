["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 19-year-old male who was hit from behind below the right knee while playing football. The gait analysis reveals a lack of fluid motion. Standing flexion test results are negative. Cruciate and collateral knee ligaments appear intact. Foot drop on the right is noted.
