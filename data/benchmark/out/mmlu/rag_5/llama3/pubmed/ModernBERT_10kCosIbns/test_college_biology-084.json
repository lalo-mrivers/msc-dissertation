["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks for a characteristic unique to angiosperms. Among the given documents, one that stands out is 'Angiosperm origin and early stages of seed plant evolution deduced from rRNA sequence comparisons'. This document discusses the evolution of seed plants and the characteristics that distinguish angiosperms from other groups. One key finding is that monocotyledons (a type of flowering plant) emerged at the earliest stages of angiosperm evolution, suggesting that they may be paraphyletic, or a group that has evolved multiple times independently.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D\n}"]
