["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks which products of ADP degradation increase in concentration in the blood during multiple sprint sports. The relevant documents are about platelet sensitivity to ADP-aggregation, effects of an anabolic steroid and sprint training on selected histochemical and morphological observations in rat skeletal muscle types, biomechanics of sprint running, a biomechanical analysis of four sprint start positions, and intermuscular coordination in a sprint push-off. From these documents, we can infer that ADP degradation is related to platelet aggregability and energy production during exercise. During multiple sprint sports, the body undergoes increased energy expenditure, which may lead to an increase in products of ADP degradation.\n\nFrom the documents, we also know that ammonia is a product of ADP degradation (Effects of an anabolic steroid and sprint training on selected histochemical and morphological observations in rat skeletal muscle types). Additionally, urea is another well-known product of ADP degradation. Uric acid is not directly related to ADP degradation but can be indirectly related as it is also a waste product of energy production during exercise.\n\nTherefore, based on the available information, we can conclude that products of ADP degradation increase in concentration in the blood during multiple sprint sports.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C: Ammonia, urea and creatinine\""]
