["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, I understand that retrotransposons are a type of genetic element that replicate via an RNA intermediate. This is evident from the discussion of retroposon replication mechanisms and the comparison with retroviral-like genes. Additionally, the presence of reverse transcriptase (RT) gene in some retroposon sequences further supports this notion.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C: A DNA sequence that replicates via an RNA intermediate\""]
