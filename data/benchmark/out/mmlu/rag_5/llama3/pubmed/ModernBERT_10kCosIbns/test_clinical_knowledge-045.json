["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the main factors determining success in sport. We need to analyze the provided documents. The first document talks about sports and health from a sociological viewpoint. It highlights that the motivation for practicing sports is often driven by friends, not necessarily by goals of physical fitness or medical benefits. This suggests that personal relationships and social connections play a significant role in sports participation.\n\nThe second document discusses the health risks associated with different sport activities. While it's important to consider these risks, it doesn't provide any insights into what makes someone successful in sports.\n\nThe third document is about medical fitness for sports, particularly cardiovascular conditions. It provides guidelines on who can participate in sports and who should avoid them due to various medical conditions. However, it doesn't offer any information on the factors determining success in sport.\n\nThe fourth document examines risk factors of sports injuries in winter, which might be relevant if we're looking at injury rates or safety concerns. Finally, the fifth document explores genetic and environmental factors that influence physical fitness, including past sport activities. This suggests that individual differences in fitness levels can impact performance in sports.\n\nConsidering these documents, it seems that innate ability and capacity to respond to training stimulus (option D) might be a significant factor determining success in sport. The studies on former athletes' physical fitness also imply that some people may have an inherent edge in terms of physical abilities.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
