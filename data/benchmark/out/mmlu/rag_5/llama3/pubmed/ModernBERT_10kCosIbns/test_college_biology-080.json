["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the similarity between cancer cells grown in culture and normal cells grown in culture. We can start by analyzing the characteristics of normal epithelial cells mentioned in 'Transitional cell cancer: establishment and characterization of cell lines'. It is stated that each cell line grew in soft agar, exhibited rapid growth and multilayering, and could be grown to high cell densities in roller-bottle cultures. This suggests that these cells do not display contact inhibition. Additionally, from the article 'Adaptation of cells derived from human malignant tumours to growth in vitro', it is mentioned that some carcinoma cell lines have adapted fully to in vitro conditions, which implies that they can grow without requiring a surface for attachment.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
