["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about normal somatic cells of a human male. The given documents provide information on sexual development, testicular function, and genetic control of male differentiation. A key concept is that male development results from the suspension of female development and the imposition of male features, which requires normal functioning of the testis. This process involves the action of at least 18 genes regulating gonadal differentiation and hormone formation. The presence or absence of certain chromosomes or characteristics can be inferred based on this information. Therefore, the typical genetic composition of a human male's somatic cells is analyzed.\", \"answer_choice\": B}"]
