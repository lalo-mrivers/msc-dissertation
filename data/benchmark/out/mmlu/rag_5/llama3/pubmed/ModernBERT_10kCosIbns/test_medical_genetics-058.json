["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is regarding exons, which are building blocks of proteins. The provided documents discuss various aspects of exons, including their prediction, amplification, and structure. From the analysis of the documents, we can infer that some exons may consist of noncoding DNA (A) as they are not translated into amino acids. There is no information about the translational start site being located in the first exon (B) or the normal termination codon always being present in the last exon (C). The prediction of exons through an analysis of spliceable open reading frames suggests that coding exons can be translated in different forward reading frames (D).\",\n\"answer_choice\": A"]
