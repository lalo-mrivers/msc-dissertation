["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about peak flow recording. The relevant document is [Comparison of six peak flow meters for patients]. This study compares the performance of five peak flowmeters with a pneumotachograph and concludes that those with less influence of the flow pattern are preferred. Since the question does not specify any particular peak flow meter, it suggests that the reader wants to know the general principle for recording peak flow results. The key point is that the scatter between different measurements depends on the applied flow pattern.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
