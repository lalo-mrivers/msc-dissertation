["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"In the Adrenaline document, we can see that adrenaline was administered at five infusion rates (0.01-0.2 micrograms kg-1 min-1). The present study investigated the relationship between supraphysiological plasma concentrations of adrenaline and the resulting haemodynamic and metabolic effects. We also know that 1 in 1000 is equivalent to 0.18 mg ml-1. Therefore, we need to find the infusion rate that corresponds to this concentration.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: 100 micrograms/mL\"\n}"]
