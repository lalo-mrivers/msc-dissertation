["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking which condition must be true for evolution to have occurred. Evolution refers to changes that occur over successive generations, so the answer cannot be B or D as these conditions relate to changes within an individual's lifetime. Option C states that the frequencies of each allele remain constant, which does not allow for any evolutionary change to occur. Therefore, the only option left is A, which suggests that the frequencies of some alleles in a population's gene pool have changed over successive generations.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
