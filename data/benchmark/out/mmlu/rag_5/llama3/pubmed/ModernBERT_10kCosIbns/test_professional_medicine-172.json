["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The couple has a family history of α-thalassemia. The woman has a minimally decreased hemoglobin concentration, which suggests she may be a carrier of α-thalassemia. Genetic studies show that the woman has a single gene deletion. This means she is a heterozygous carrier of α-thalassemia. The man has microcytic anemia and a two-gene deletion, which means he is homozygous for α-thalassemia.\n\nWhen they have offspring, there are three possible genotypes: normal (nn), carrier (n-), and affected (-/-. The key to this question is the trans configuration of the two-gene deletions. Since the woman's deletion is on one gene and the man's deletion is on another gene, we need to consider the inheritance patterns.\n\nWhen the father's genotype (-/-) combines with the mother's carrier genotype (n-), there are three possible offspring genotypes: nn, n-, and -/-. The only affected offspring (-/--) will have two-gene deletions. Since the woman is a carrier of α-thalassemia, she can contribute either a normal gene or an affected gene to their offspring.\n\nWhen we combine these possibilities, we find that 50% of the offspring will be carriers (n-), and 25% of them will be affected (-/--) with two-gene deletions.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
