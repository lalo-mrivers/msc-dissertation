["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the frequency of AABBCC individuals from a mating of two AaBbCc individuals, we need to consider the possible genotypes that can result from this mating. Since both parents are heterozygous for all three loci (A/B and C), the offspring can inherit different combinations of alleles from each parent. This will lead to several possible genotypes. However, not all these genotypes will be AABBCC. We need to calculate the probability of each genotype and then sum them up to get the overall frequency.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
