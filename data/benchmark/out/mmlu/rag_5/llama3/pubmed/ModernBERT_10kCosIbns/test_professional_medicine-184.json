["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about a patient with a malignant mass located below the dentate line. The relevant document about carcinoma of anal-ductal origin suggests that recurrent perianal fistulas were treated locally for two years until biopsy proved the malignancy. Gross and histologic examination of the specimen removed by abdominoperineal resection demonstrated the anal ductal origin of this tumor. Recurrence was seen in less than a year.\n\nThe document [Malignant tumors of the anal canal] suggests that various treatment modalities, peculiarities of early diagnosis, causes of tumor advancement and end results of treatment of cancer of the anal canal are discussed.\n\nThe document [Anatomical study of para-aortic and pelvic lymph nodes in gynecologic malignancies] suggests that the lymphatic system of the pelvis was divided into six groups, depending on the relationship with the pelvic blood vessels. The pelvic nodes were distinguished as common, internal and external iliac, presacral, obturator, and parametrial.\n\nThe document [Correlation between side of palpable tumor and side of pelvic lymph node metastasis in clinically localized prostate cancer] suggests that lymph node metastases in patients with clinically localized palpable prostate cancer are most likely to be found on the same side as the palpable tumor.\n\nConsidering these documents, it is most appropriate to evaluate the superficial inguinal lymph nodes for possible metastasis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
