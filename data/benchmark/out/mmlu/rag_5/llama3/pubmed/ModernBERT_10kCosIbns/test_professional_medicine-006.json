["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 72-year-old woman with advanced ovarian cancer metastatic to the liver. She has been receiving chemotherapy for 2 years and is experiencing significant symptoms including crying and inability to get out of bed. Despite her pain being only 1-2 on a 10-point scale, it's clear that she is experiencing distress and depression. The patient is also taking oxycodone and fluoxetine for management of her symptoms.\n\nGiven the patient's history of major depressive disorder and current symptoms, reassurance alone may not be sufficient to manage her symptoms.
