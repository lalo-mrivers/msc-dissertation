["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the given documents, we can infer that the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) is located within the inner mitochondrial membrane. This is mentioned in the article 'Regulation of mammalian pyruvate dehydrogenase.' Additionally, the study on cryoelectron microscopy shows that PDC has an overall shape resembling a pentagonal dodecahedron and that E1 and E3 are attached to the E2-core complex by flexible tethers. This suggests that PDC is situated within the mitochondria, which contains the inner mitochondrial membrane.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
