["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about Cushing's Syndrome. We can look at the provided documents to find information related to this topic. The main points mentioned are: difficulties in diagnosing Cushing's syndrome, especially when features are incomplete; the importance of considering Cushing's syndrome in differential diagnosis even if only one feature is present; and the value of certain tests such as urinary free cortisol and cortisol response to insulin-induced hypoglycaemia in distinguishing cases with endocrine disease from those with Cushing's syndrome. None of these points suggest a deficiency of cortisol hormone, which contradicts option A. Enlarged extremities are not mentioned as a common feature, so option B is incorrect. The document does mention osteoporosis as one of the features that may be incomplete in Cushing's syndrome, making option C false. Finally, a moon face and buffalo hump are indeed characteristic features of Cushing's syndrome, as mentioned in [Differential diagnosis of essential obesity and Cushing's syndrome].\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
