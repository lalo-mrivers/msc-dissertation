["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking what variables must be known to determine the Doppler shift in perceived sound frequency. The problem statement discusses Doppler signals and their properties, but does not explicitly mention determining Doppler shifts. However, it provides information about the Doppler effect and its relationship to flow measurement. Based on this information, we can deduce that the Doppler shift is related to the velocity of the scatterers (flow), which in turn depends on the frequency of emitted sound, distance between source and detector, and speed of sound in the medium.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: I and IV\"\n}"]
