["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents discuss AMP-deaminase, which is an enzyme that deaminates branched-chain amino acids. The documents also discuss the metabolism of amino acids with ramified chain and the transport of amino acids into muscle tissue. We can see that when branched-chain amino acids are deaminated in muscle, the ammonia produced is mostly converted into urea and released from the muscle.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
