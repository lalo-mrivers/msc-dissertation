["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The passage does not explicitly state the requirement for a primer or enzyme for synthesizing an RNA/DNA hybrid from a single-stranded RNA template. However, we can infer that DNA polymerase is not required based on the studies on nucleic acid reassociation kinetics which indicate that the rate of reaction of excess double-stranded DNA with enzymatically synthesized asymmetric RNA tracers was measured. Additionally, the passage mentions the possibility of RNA-synthesis by E. coli RNA-polymerase using denatured DNA-templates from mouse liver, immobilized on nitrocellulose filters, which suggests that an enzyme other than DNA polymerase is involved in the synthesis of RNA. Therefore, we can conclude that a DNA or RNA primer and DNA polymerase are not required for synthesizing an RNA/DNA hybrid from a single-stranded RNA template.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
