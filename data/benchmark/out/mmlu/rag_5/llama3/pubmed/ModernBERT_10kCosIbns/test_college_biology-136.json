["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the progeny of a female fruit fly with gray body and normal wings mating with a male fruit fly with black body and vestigial wings. The presence of gray-bodied, vestigial-winged flies among the progeny indicates that the genes for gray body and normal wings are linked, but not fully penetrant (since vestigial wings appear). This suggests that there must be some recombination or shuffling of alleles between the linked genes to produce this phenotype. Considering the documents provided, specifically the Linkage analysis of five new genetic markers of the oriental fruit fly section, it is clear that linkage and crossing over are the primary mechanisms for generating recombinant offspring. Therefore, the best explanation for the gray-bodied, vestigial-winged flies among the progeny is through crossing over.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
