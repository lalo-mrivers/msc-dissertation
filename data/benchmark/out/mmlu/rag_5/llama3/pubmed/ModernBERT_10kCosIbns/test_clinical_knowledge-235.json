["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The given documents describe different types of exercise experiments. One study examines the effect of prolonged intermittent exercise combined with food deprivation on plasma metabolite concentration. Another study measures glucose turnover and its regulation during intense exercise and recovery in normal male subjects. The last study discusses energy expenditure following a bout of non-steady state resistance exercise, carbohydrate supplementation during exercise, and carbohydrate feeding during exercise. To answer this question, we need to focus on the studies that involve high-intensity exercise. The Glucose turnover and its regulation during intense exercise and recovery in normal male subjects study shows that plasma glucose increased during exercise, then abruptly rose to 6.91 +/- 0.40 mM/L at 4 min recovery then gradually declined. This indicates a frequent rise of 1-3 mM in blood glucose concentration.\",\n\"answer_choice\": A"]
