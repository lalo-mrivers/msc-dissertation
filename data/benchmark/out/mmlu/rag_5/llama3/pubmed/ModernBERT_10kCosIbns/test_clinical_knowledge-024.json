["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about processes that modify protein structure after translation has occurred. We can look at the provided documents to identify these processes. The Mechanism and regulation of eukaryotic protein synthesis document mentions phosphorylation as a way to control translation, but it doesn't specifically mention modifying protein structure. The Novel factors in protein biosynthesis document discusses ribosomes recognizing stop triplets, which is related to termination rather than modification of the translated protein. The Diversity of mechanisms in the regulation of translation in prokaryotes and lower eukaryotes document mentions alterations in mRNA structure and modulation of translation initiation factors, but doesn't provide information on modifying protein structure after translation. Based on this analysis, we can conclude that the answer is not phosphorylation, which is a way to control translation rather than modify protein structure.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
