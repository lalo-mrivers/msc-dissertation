["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Since nerve outgrowth begins at the growth cone, it's important to understand how exposure to cytochalasin B affects this process. Microspikes of the growth cone extend and retract to move the growth cone forward. This suggests that microfilaments in the microspike play a crucial role in the movement of the growth cone. Cytochalasin B is known to disrupt actin filaments, which are a type of microfilament. Therefore, exposure to cytochalasin B would likely cause the microfilaments in the microspike to undergo reversible depolymerization, allowing for further reorganization and re-extension.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
