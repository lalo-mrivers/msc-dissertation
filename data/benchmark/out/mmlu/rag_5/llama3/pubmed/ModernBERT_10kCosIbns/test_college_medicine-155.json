["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question states that the hormone is found both inside and out of cells when carrying out its function, increases the amount of nucleic acid in the cell while functioning, and is derived from a structure containing four hydroxycarbon rings. This suggests that the hormone may be involved in cellular processes such as gene regulation or protein synthesis. The fact that it is present outside of cells also implies that it may have an endocrine function. Based on these characteristics, I would suggest that the hormone may be a steroid hormone.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
