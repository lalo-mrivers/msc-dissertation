["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the electrons with a quantum number l = 2. This is related to the atomic structure of gold (Au). According to the periodic table, gold has an atomic number of 79 and belongs to group 11 (formerly IIB). The electron configuration of gold is [Xe] 4f14 5d10 6s1. The electrons with a quantum number l = 2 are part of the f-subshell, which in this case is occupied by 14 electrons.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
