["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the function of the frontal lobe of the brain's cortex. One of the relevant documents talks about the development of the frontal zone in monkeys and man, which mentions the formation of the fields of the frontal zone (8, 3, 10, 11, 12). This suggests that the frontal lobe is involved in cognitive processes. Another document discusses the heterosensory interaction of neurons in the cat frontal association cortex, which implies that the frontal lobe is responsible for processing and integrating multiple sensory inputs. The other documents do not directly address the question. Based on this information, it can be inferred that the frontal lobe is involved in higher-level cognitive processes.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C: Understanding others' speech.\""]
