["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the mutational mechanism in δβ-thalassaemia. The relevant documents mention delta-beta-thalassaemia as an interaction of beta-thalassaemia with delta-beta-thalassaemia, but they don't provide specific information on the mutational mechanism. However, we can infer that it's not a simple deletion or duplication based on the fact that there is an imbalance in globin chain synthesis. This suggests that the mutation may be affecting the production of one or both types of globins.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
