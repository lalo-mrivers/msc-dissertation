["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the digestion of HeLa nucleosomes by different endonucleases. The goal is to identify the target of digestion for a nucleosome dimer to yield monomers. Based on the information provided, it can be inferred that DNase I and other endonucleases like micrococcal nuclease (Mnase) are used to digest chromatin and produce oligomers. The text also mentions the structure of a DNase I-octamer complex, which provides insight into the enzyme's interaction with DNA. Considering these points, it can be concluded that the target of digestion for a nucleosome dimer to yield monomers is the linker DNA.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
