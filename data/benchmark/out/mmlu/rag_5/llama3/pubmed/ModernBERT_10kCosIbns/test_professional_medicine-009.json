["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the patient's history of passing a renal calculus with calcium as the primary cation, we can infer that he has a kidney stone related to hypercalcaemia. The patient's increased urine calcium excretion also suggests an issue with urinary calcium excretion. We can look at the provided documents for clues on how to approach this case.\n\nFrom the document 'Urinary calcium excretion in relation to kidney function in the adult', we see that there is a significant correlation between the glomerular filtration rate and mean urinary calcium concentration. This suggests that altered renal function could be contributing to the patient's hypercalcaemia.\n\nThe document 'Ionized calcium in patients with chronic renal failure' notes that in patients with first stage CRF, total serum calcium did not significantly decrease, but ionized calcium was within reference value limits. However, for patients with second and third stage CRF, total serum calcium was significantly lower, while ionized calcium remained unchanged.\n\nGiven the patient's history of passing a renal calculus, we can infer that he likely has some degree of chronic renal failure. Therefore, it is possible that his hypercalcaemia is related to his kidney function rather than an underlying endocrine disorder like hyperparathyroidism.\n\nFrom 'Hypercalcaemic crises in patients with chronic renal failure caused by ion-exchange resins, antacidotics and other calcium-containing drugs', we see that treatment with calcium-containing drugs can cause hypercalcaemia in patients with chronic renal failure. This suggests that the patient's hypercalcaemia may be related to his kidney function rather than an underlying endocrine disorder like hyperparathyroidism.\n\nConsidering these points, it is possible that the patient's hypercalcaemia is related to his altered renal function and increased urinary calcium excretion. Therefore, the most appropriate pharmacotherapy would likely involve managing his chronic renal failure rather than treating an underlying endocrine disorder.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D: Osmotic diuretic\"}"]
