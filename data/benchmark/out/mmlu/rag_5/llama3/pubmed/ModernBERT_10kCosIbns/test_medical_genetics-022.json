["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The pattern of inheritance is determined by the molecular basis of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency. The relevant documents mention that G6PD is one of the most polymorphic proteins known, with more than 300 different variants reported. It is also mentioned that numerous lines of evidence indicate that female heterozygotes have a selective advantage in malaria infections. This suggests that the inheritance pattern may be influenced by sex-linked characteristics. Additionally, the document mentions that the detection of female heterozygous glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency requires a combination of parameters, including mosaicism even in case of normal activity. This implies that there may be differences in gene expression between males and females. Therefore, considering these factors, it is most likely that the pattern of inheritance is X-linked recessive.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
