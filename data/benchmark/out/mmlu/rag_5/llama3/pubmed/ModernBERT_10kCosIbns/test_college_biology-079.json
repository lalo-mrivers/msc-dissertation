["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The cross between a tall violet plant (DDWw) and a dwarf white plant is a monohybrid cross. Since the allele for tall plants (D) is completely dominant to the allele for dwarf plants (d), we expect the tall trait to be expressed in all offspring that inherit at least one 'T' allele. Similarly, since the allele for violet flower color (W) is completely dominant to the allele for white flower color (w), we expect the violet trait to be expressed in all offspring that inherit at least one 'W' allele.\n\nThe possible genotypes of the offspring are DDWW, DdWW, ddWW, DDww, DdwW, dDww. Since the 'T' allele is dominant and the 'V' allele is also dominant, we expect the following phenotypic ratio: all tall violet.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
