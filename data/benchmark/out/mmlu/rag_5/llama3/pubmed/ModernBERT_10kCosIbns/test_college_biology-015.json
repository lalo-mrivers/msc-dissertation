["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question describes the release of proteolytic enzymes due to a rise in intracellular free calcium. This event is caused by fertilization. The events described entail cortical granule exocytosis which provides part of the lost calcium, and the loss of calcium at fertilization suggests that some of this calcium could be provided by cortical granules during exocytosis. Additionally, injecting EGTA prevents cortical vesicle discharge and formation of the fertilization membrane, confirming that the rise in intracellular free calcium triggers the cortical reaction.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
