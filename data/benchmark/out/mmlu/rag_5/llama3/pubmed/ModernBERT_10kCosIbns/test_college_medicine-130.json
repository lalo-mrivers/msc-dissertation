["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks why proteins are treated with a detergent (SDS) before being run through an SDS-PAGE procedure. The key here is that the question is about SDS-PAGE, which stands for Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis. This technique separates proteins based on their molecular weight. Therefore, we need to understand why SDS is used in this context. According to the provided documents, the SDS serves as a detergent. In the 'Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis of membrane proteins' document, it states that electrophoresis in the second dimension is 'in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate, thus separating proteins on the basis of molecular weight.' This suggests that the SDS helps to separate the proteins based on their size. Therefore, we can infer that the proteins are treated with a detergent before being run through the electrophoresis gel to allow them to be separated solely on the basis of their molecular weight.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
