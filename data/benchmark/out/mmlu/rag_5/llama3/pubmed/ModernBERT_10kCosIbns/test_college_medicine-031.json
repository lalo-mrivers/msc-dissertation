["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The second scientist believes that advantages each organism possessed were absent for a long time, randomly occurred, and when they were beneficial, that organism would rapidly populate the population over a short period of time. This suggests that evolution is driven by random genetic variation rather than selection pressures.\n\nTo strengthen this argument, we need to show that there are periods of stagnation followed by rapid evolutionary change. This would support the idea that evolution is a punctuated process rather than a gradual one.\n\nThe study that shows long periods of stagnant growth followed by short bursts of massive evolution (B) would be a strong evidence for the second scientist's argument.\", \"answer_choice\": B}"]
