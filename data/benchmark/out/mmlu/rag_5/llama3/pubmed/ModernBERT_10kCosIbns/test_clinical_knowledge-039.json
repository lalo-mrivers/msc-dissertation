["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking to find the rate of energy expenditure given the mean rate of oxygen consumption. The relationship between oxygen consumption (VO2) and energy expenditure is well-studied. A commonly cited conversion factor is 21 kJ/L, meaning that for every liter of O2 consumed, the body expends approximately 21 kJ of energy. Given the mean rate of oxygen consumption as 2 L/min, we can calculate the rate of energy expenditure by multiplying VO2 by this conversion factor.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
