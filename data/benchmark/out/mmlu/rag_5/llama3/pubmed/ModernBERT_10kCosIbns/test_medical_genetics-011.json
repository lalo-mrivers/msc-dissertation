["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the composition of normal adult haemoglobin (Hb A). From the documents provided, we can see that Hb F is discussed as a variable elevation in various conditions. However, this does not provide information on the composition of normal adult haemoglobin. We also have information on glycosylated minor components of human adult hemoglobin, including Hb A1a, Hb A1b, and Hb A1c. This suggests that there are different forms of haemoglobin beyond just the 'normal' form. The document on fetal haemoglobin levels in acquired and congenital haematological diseases and malignant tumours in adults provides information on Hb F values in various conditions, but does not specifically discuss normal adult haemoglobin. Finally, the document on hemoglobin A1 quantity in individual red cells of normal adults provides data on the weight of HbA1 in individual red cells, but this is not relevant to the composition of normal adult haemoglobin.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
