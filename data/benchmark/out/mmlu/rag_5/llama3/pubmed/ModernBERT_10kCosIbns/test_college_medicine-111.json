["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The problem is related to gas laws. We know that the volume of a gas at constant temperature is inversely proportional to the pressure. So, if we have a volume of 0.1L at 200atm, we can use the inverse relationship to find the volume at 1atm. This means that as the pressure decreases from 200atm to 1atm, the volume will increase proportionally.\", \"answer_choice\": B}"]
