["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the major concentrations of proprioceptive receptors providing information about position of the TMJ. The documents provided do not directly mention the TMJ, but they do discuss proprioception and its relation to joints. The Innervation of the temporomandibular joint document mentions that there are two types of mechanoreceptors in the human temporomandibular joint: one corresponding to the capsular form and the other corresponding to the Golgi tendon organ. This suggests that proprioceptive receptors may be present in the capsule and ligaments of the TMJ, as well as possibly in the medial or lateral pterygoid muscles.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
