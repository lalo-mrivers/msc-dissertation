["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The Hardy-Weinberg law is a mathematical model that describes the equilibrium frequencies of alleles in a population. It's based on several assumptions, which are: 1) there's no gene flow (genetic exchange with other populations), 2) the population size is large enough for random mating to occur, 3) there's no natural selection, and 4) matings are random. Therefore, we need to find the option that does not meet one of these conditions.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
