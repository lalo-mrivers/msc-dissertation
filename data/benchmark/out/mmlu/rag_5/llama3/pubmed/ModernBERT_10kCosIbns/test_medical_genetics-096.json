["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about high blood ammonia levels. One of the provided documents discusses normal values for blood ammonia in man, which are 27.4 +/- 10.2 mumol/l NH+4 in arterial blood and 20.9 +/- 9.8 mumol/l in venous blood. This information can be used to determine what is considered a high blood ammonia level. Additionally, one of the documents discusses human physiological response and adaptation to ammonia, which mentions that ammonia concentrations normally encountered industrially are not significantly different from those found in man. Therefore, it is likely that a high blood ammonia level would refer to values above the normal range discussed earlier.\n\nNow, let's analyze the potential choices: Galactosaemia (A) is a genetic disorder characterized by impaired galactose metabolism, which could lead to an increase in blood ammonia levels. Hurler's syndrome (B) is a lysosomal storage disease that may not be directly related to high blood ammonia levels. Ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC) deficiency (C) is a rare genetic disorder that affects the urea cycle and can lead to increased blood ammonia levels. Phenylketonuria (D) is a genetic disorder characterized by impaired phenylalanine metabolism, which may not be directly related to high blood ammonia levels.\n\nBased on the analysis, it is most likely that option C, ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC) deficiency, is correct.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
