["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"There is no direct information about which organ secretes insulin in the provided documents. However, we can infer that it's not the gastric parietal cells (A) or the walls of the large intestine (C) because there is no mention of these organs being involved in insulin secretion.
