["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the effect of endurance training on muscle capacity. From the first document 'Measuring exercise-induced adaptations and injury with magnetic resonance spectroscopy', we can see that endurance training increases the metabolic capacity of calf muscles, measured as the rate of phosphocreatine (PCr) recovery following submaximal exercise. This suggests that endurance training increases the ability to generate energy anaerobically.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
