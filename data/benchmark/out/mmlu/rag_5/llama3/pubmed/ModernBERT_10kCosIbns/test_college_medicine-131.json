["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the initial energy source for very high force contractions lasting 1-2 seconds. From the documents provided, we know that during muscle contraction, the rate of chemical reaction has a maximum at F=0 (Section III). This suggests that ATP stores are involved in providing the initial energy. Additionally, in the paper on myocardial oxygen consumption, it is stated that there is a constant linear relationship between tension development and oxygen uptake, implying that ATP stores are used to provide energy for contraction.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: ATP stores\"\n}"]
