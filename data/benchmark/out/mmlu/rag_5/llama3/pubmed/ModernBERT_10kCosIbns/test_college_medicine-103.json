["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the nature of mutations. According to the provided documents, mutations are errors in DNA that occur spontaneously at a low rate. This is supported by the mention of 'spontaneous' mutagenesis and 'repair mutagenesis' in one of the documents. Additionally, the document on 'Mechanism and kinetics of repair mutagenesis' discusses how DNA damage can lead to point mutations, suggesting that some mutations are caused by errors during the repair process. Therefore, option D best describes the nature of mutations.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
