["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the structure of genes, including atomic sites such as initiation codons, stop codons, acceptor sites, and donor sites. Exons are mentioned as higher-order gene elements that are combined into probable genes. The compositional properties of human genes suggest a relationship between GC levels in exons, intergenic sequences, and introns. Considering this information, the coding sequences of genes are referred to as exons.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
