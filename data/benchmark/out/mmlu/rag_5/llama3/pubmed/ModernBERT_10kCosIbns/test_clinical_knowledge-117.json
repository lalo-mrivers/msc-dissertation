["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking which of the given options can act as an intracellular buffer to limit pH changes when the rate of glycolysis is high. Upon reviewing the provided documents, I found that the article '31P nuclear magnetic resonance studies of bioenergetics and glycolysis in anaerobic Escherichia coli cells.' mentions that the ATP produced by glycolysis is hydrolyzed by the membrane ATPase to generate a delta pH. This implies that when the rate of glycolysis is high, there may be a significant change in pH levels. However, it does not specifically mention any of the given options as an intracellular buffer.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
