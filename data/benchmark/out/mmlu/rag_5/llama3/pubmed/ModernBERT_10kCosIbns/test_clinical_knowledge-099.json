["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To calculate the daily dose of Cotrimoxazole, we need to consider that it is prescribed every 12 hours. Since there are two doses per day (morning and evening), we multiply the single dose by 2. Then, we convert this value from milligrams (mg) to grams. The conversion factor is 1 g = 1000 mg, so we divide the total milligrams by 1000 to get the grams. Finally, we calculate the daily dose as twice the single dose multiplied by the conversion factor.\", \"answer_choice\": B}"]
