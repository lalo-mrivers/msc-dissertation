["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents discuss sperm penetration and fertilization. In the first document, human spermatozoa failed to penetrate zona-free mouse or rat ova in vitro. However, when bovine serum albumin (BSA) was added to the culture medium, human spermatozoa retained their morphological integrity and motility, and attachment and penetration of human oocytes occurred. This suggests that capacitation is necessary for fertilization. In the second document, boar spermatozoa were preincubated in a modified KRB or isolated genital tract before introduction into medium containing ovarian oocytes. The results suggest that capacitation of epididymal spermatozoa was better than that of ejaculated spermatozoa. In the third document, human spermatozoa may become capacitated in vitro within 3-4 hours. Finally, the fourth document discusses the distribution and morphology of bovine spermatozoa in the oviduct before and after ovulation, including changes in their surface membranes and neighbouring epithelium during capacitation.\n\nThe combination of these findings suggests that fertilization occurs in a structure where capacitation can occur, such as the Fallopian tube.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
