["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the expected incidence of affected homozygous females given that an X-linked recessive disorder is in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium and the incidence in males equals 1 in 100. We know from the relevant documents that the frequency of mutant alleles in females at equilibrium is related to the mutation rate and mean selection coefficient in females. Since the disorder is recessive, affected homozygous females have two copies of the mutated allele. The probability of this event is equal to the square of the frequency of the mutated allele in females. Given that the incidence in males equals 1 in 100, we can infer that the frequency of the mutated allele in males is 1/100. Since the disorder is X-linked and recessive, the frequency of the mutated allele in females will be roughly half that of males. Therefore, the frequency of the mutated allele in females is approximately 1/200. The probability of affected homozygous females is thus the square of this value, which is approximately (1/200)^2 = 1/4000.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
