["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the selection and mutation at an X-linked locus document, we can see that the frequency of mutant alleles in females is related to the mutation rates and mean selection coefficients. Since the frequency of males affected with an X-linked recessive condition is 0.10 (one in ten), we know that the frequency of carriers (heterozygous females) is half of this value, or 0.05. To find the expected frequency of affected females, we need to consider the estimation of the frequency of recessive X-chromosome-associated traits among females document. According to this document, the estimation of the frequency of female carriers of recessive conditions associated with the X chromosome is possible when the frequency of the affection among men is known. Since the frequency of males affected with an X-linked recessive condition is 0.10, we can use this information to estimate the frequency of affected females.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A: 0.01\"\n}"]
