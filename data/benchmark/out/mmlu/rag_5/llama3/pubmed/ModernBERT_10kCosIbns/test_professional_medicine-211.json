["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the single nucleotide difference found in the patient's molecular testing for FBN1. Since it does not change the amino acid at that locus, we can rule out options A and D. The presence of this same nucleotide change in 15 of 200 individuals without Marfan syndrome suggests that it is a polymorphism rather than a disease-causing mutation. Additionally, since the mother has the same single nucleotide change as the patient but does not have clinical evidence of Marfan syndrome, we can conclude that this sequence variant is unlikely to be disease-causing.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
