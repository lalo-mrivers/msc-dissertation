["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the process of palatal shelf elevation in rat fetuses. According to Palatal shelf elevation in the Wistar rat fetus, shelf elevation occurs at day 16.4 +/- 0.1 and is facilitated by turgor pressure due to binding of water to mucopolysaccharides. The study suggests that this intrinsic force elevates the shelves, which then fuse with the nasal septum. In Palate morphogenesis. III. Changes in cell shape and orientation during shelf elevation, it is proposed that an active contraction of specific palate cells could also aid the process of shelf elevation. Finally, Experimental induction of premature movement of rat palatal shelves in vivo shows that physical forces can elevate palatal shelves prematurely.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
