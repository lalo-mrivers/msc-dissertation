["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents suggest that DiGeorge syndrome is caused by a deletion in chromosome 22. Specifically, it says 'consistent deletions and microdeletions of 22q11' are etiologic in the vast majority of cases. Additionally, molecular studies detected DNA deletions in all 14 patients with DGS. Two loci tested, D22S75 and D22S259, are deleted in all 14 patients. A third locus, D22S66, is deleted in eight DGS probands tested. Physical mapping using somatic cell hybrids places D22S66 between D22S75 and D22S259, suggesting that it should be deleted in the remaining six cases.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
