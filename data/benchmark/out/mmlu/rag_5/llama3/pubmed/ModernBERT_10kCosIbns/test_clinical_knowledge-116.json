["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking which option is not associated with an increase in the work of breathing. We need to look at the documents provided to identify what increases the work of breathing.\n\nFrom 'Interrelationships of the volume and time components of individual breaths in resting man', we know that VT, TI and TE have significant correlations. Specifically, VT and TI have a highly significant positive correlation (mean r = +0-704), indicating that inspiratory flow rate is held relatively constant from breath to breath.\n\nFrom 'Variability of the respiratory phase, respiratory pause, and numbers and durations of respirations during periodic breathing', we know that tachypnoea (respiratory rate higher than normal) can increase the work of breathing.\n\nHowever, none of the options provided explicitly state a decrease in the work of breathing. Therefore, we need to look for an option that is not typically associated with an increase in the work of breathing.\n\nOption D, 'A respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute', seems unusual as it's a relatively low respiratory rate. Typically, an increase in the work of breathing would be associated with increased respiratory rates or other physiological changes that require more energy to breathe.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that Option D is not associated with an increase in the work of breathing.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
