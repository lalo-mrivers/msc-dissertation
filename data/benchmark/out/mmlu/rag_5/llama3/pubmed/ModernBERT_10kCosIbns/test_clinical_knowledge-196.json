["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the given documents, we can see that hypertonic solutions are defined as having a higher concentration of solutes than the normal human cell. This is evident from the study on 'Volume therapy with hypertonic saline hydroxyethyl starch solution in cardiac surgery' which states that the ideal solution for volume therapy remains controversial and that the present study examines the effects of a new hypertonic saline hydroxyethyl starch solution compared to a 6% hydroxyethyl starch solution. Similarly, the document on 'Cardiac contractility and blood flow distribution following resuscitation with 7.5% hypertonic saline in anesthetized dogs' states that the animals were resuscitated with either HTS (n = 8) at 5 ml/kg or LR (n = 7) at a dose required for equivalent restoration of cardiac output. This suggests that HTS is a type of hypertonic solution.\",\n\"answer_choice\": A"]
