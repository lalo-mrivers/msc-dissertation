["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the first point of entry of water at the roots of a monocot plant. The relevant documents are [Dynamic characteristics of growth of the root system of a plant and methods of determining it], [Electron microscopy study of the microorganism topography on plant roots], The effects of root shape and biology on bone growth, and Histochemical studies in stomatal apparatus of Phaseolus mungo Linn. II. Localization of phosphorylase. Among these documents, [Histochemical studies in stomatal apparatus of Phaseolus mungo Linn. II. Localization of phosphorylase] seems to be the most relevant as it is about plant roots and water entry.\n\nWithin this document, it talks about the cytoplasm of cells and starch. This suggests that the first point of entry of water at the roots of a monocot plant is indeed within the cytoplasm of cells., \"answer_choice\": B}"]
