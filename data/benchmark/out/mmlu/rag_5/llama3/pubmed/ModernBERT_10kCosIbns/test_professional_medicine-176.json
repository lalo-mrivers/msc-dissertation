["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with a 5-day history of diarrhea after completing his third course of antibiotics for mastoiditis. Physical examination reveals vague generalized abdominal pain on palpation. Culture on Hektoen enteric agar is positive.

The symptoms of weight loss, nocturnal diarrhea, and absence of tenesmus are also indicative of an organic cause.
