["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents discuss the metabolism of free fatty acids (FFAs) and their transport in the blood. In 'Turnover of individual free fatty acids in man', it is mentioned that FFA are transported as lipoproteins, but this information only applies to specific situations. The other documents do not provide direct information on how most of the FFA are transported. However, 'Enzymatic microdetermination of plasma and serum free fatty acids' mentions that fat-free human serum albumin (HSA) is added to standards to reduce initial reaction rates but does not affect end-point fluorescence levels. This suggests that albumin plays a role in transporting FFA.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: bound to albumin\"\n}"]
