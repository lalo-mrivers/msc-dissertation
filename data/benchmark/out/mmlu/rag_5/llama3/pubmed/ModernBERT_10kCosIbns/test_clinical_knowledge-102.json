["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"There are no documents provided that directly address blocked catheters after transurethral resection of prostate with irrigation. However, we can consider the information from 'Radioisotope investigation of continuous bladder irrigation after transurethral resection.' The study suggests that continuous bladder irrigation is safe and effective after transurethral resection, as long as techniques are sterile. Since the patient has a blocked catheter, it's likely that the goal is to complete bladder washout. Given this context, we can infer that a solution for completing bladder washout would be suitable.\n\nComparing this information with the available options, we find that 'Solution R' and 'Solution G' are not mentioned in any of the provided documents. Therefore, it's unlikely that these solutions would be recommended for completing bladder washout after transurethral resection with irrigation.\n\nOn the other hand, normal saline is a common solution used in many medical procedures, including irrigation. It's possible that this could be used to complete bladder washout in this scenario.\n\nIn conclusion, although there isn't a direct match between the provided documents and the specific situation presented, it seems reasonable to infer that normal saline might be an appropriate choice for completing bladder washout after transurethral resection with irrigation.\", \"answer_choice\": B}"]
