["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the developmental defects that occur due to mutation of homeotic cluster genes in Drosophila. The provided documents highlight the importance of homeotic genes in regulating development and the expression patterns of these genes. Specifically, the documents discuss the role of Hox-4 genes in murine development and their similarity to Drosophila AbdB homeotic genes. Additionally, the papers on Adh locus evolution and trans-regulation of homeotic genes in Drosophila provide context for understanding the function of homeotic genes. Based on this information, we can infer that mutation of homeotic cluster genes may result in developmental defects.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
