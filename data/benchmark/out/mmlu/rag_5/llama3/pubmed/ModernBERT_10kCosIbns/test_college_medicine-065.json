["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the structure of DNA, including the base pairing between purines (A/G) and pyrimidines (C/T). There is no information about RNA or genetic determination. The stability of parallel-stranded DNA homoduplexes does not impact the ratio of purines to pyrimidines. Considering that DNA polymerase activity is involved in the formation of phosphonester bonds, it's clear that the answer is not determined by base sequence in RNA or genetic determination. Therefore, the only plausible option is A: variable.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
