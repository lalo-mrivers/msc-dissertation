["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"After reviewing the relevant documents, we see that the functional model of the nephron mentions active transportation of sodium in the loop of Henle being limited to the thick ascending limb. This implies that the descending loop of Henle is not involved in this process. The other options are not explicitly mentioned as permeable substances in the descending loop of Henle. Therefore, we can conclude that the correct answer is related to passive transport.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B: H2O\"\n}"]
