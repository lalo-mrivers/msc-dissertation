["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the most likely cause of acute urinary retention of urine. The provided documents talk about different types of urinary retention, but they don't directly discuss acute urinary retention. However, we can look for information that might be relevant to this scenario. The document 'Acute retention of urine: is trial without catheter justified?' talks about patients who had an episode of acute retention of urine in men and the outcome of a trial without catheter. This suggests that acute urinary retention may not always require definitive treatment, but rather a trial period to see if micturition is re-established. There is no mention of haematuria, drinking alcohol, or kidney stones as causes of acute urinary retention. The document 'Postoperative urinary retention' mentions that some patients who had spinal anesthesia with tetracaine and adrenaline experienced postoperative urinary retention, but it's not clear if this is related to acute urinary retention.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
