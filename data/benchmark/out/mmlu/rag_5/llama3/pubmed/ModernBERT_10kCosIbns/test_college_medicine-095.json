["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the structure of triacylglycerides. The relevant documents describe triglycerides as containing isotopically-labelled fatty acids incorporated by incubation in vitro with the relevant enzyme systems.

Therefore, the correct answer must include 'glycerol' in its description.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
