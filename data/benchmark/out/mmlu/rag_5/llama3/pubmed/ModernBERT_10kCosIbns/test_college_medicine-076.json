["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe motor endplate potentials and the release of neurotransmitters. The study on miniature end-plate potentials suggests that the occurrence of these potentials is not Poisson-distributed, indicating quantal release interdependencies. This implies that an action potential arriving at the motor endplate causes the release of a specific neurotransmitter, which is not specified in the text.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
