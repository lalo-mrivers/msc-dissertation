["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"There is no direct mention of Moshe Szyf or colleagues' work on prenatal maternal stress in the provided documents. However, we can infer that 'epigenetic influences' are related to genomic imprinting (mentioned in the document 'Relevance of genomic imprinting to human diseases'). Epigenetics is a field that studies heritable changes in gene function without altering the underlying DNA sequence. The mention of prenatal diagnosis and genetic counseling suggests that fetal development is relevant. Putting these together, I'm looking for an answer choice related to epigenetic influences on fetal development.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A: developmental epigenetics\""]
