["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"When the efferent arteriole is constricted with a vascular clamp, it increases resistance to blood flow. Since the afferent arterial pressure remains constant at 100 mm Hg, the glomerular capillary pressure will increase due to increased hydrostatic pressure from the constriction. This would lead to an increase in filtration coefficient (Kf).\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
