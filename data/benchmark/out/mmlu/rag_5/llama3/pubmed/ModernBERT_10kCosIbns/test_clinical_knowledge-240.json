["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to find the relationship between oxygen uptake and energy expenditure. From the provided documents, we can see that oxygen consumption (VO2) was measured in several studies, including one where VO2max was determined during maximal exercise on a bicycle ergometer. We also know that 1 liter of O2 is equivalent to approximately 21 kJ of energy. Since the athlete's steady-rate oxygen uptake averages 3.0 l/min for 5 minutes of exercise, we can calculate the total amount of oxygen consumed: 3.0 l/min * 5 min = 15 l. Then, we multiply this value by the equivalent energy per liter of O2 (21 kJ/l) to get the total energy expenditure: 15 l * 21 kJ/l â‰ˆ 315 kJ. Finally, since this is a steady-rate oxygen uptake, we can assume that the energy expenditure is approximately linear with respect to time and oxygen consumption.\", \"answer_choice\": C}"]
