["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the movement of lactate and hydrogen ions from muscle tissue. In 'Comparison of efflux rates of hydrogen and lactate ions from isolated muscles in vitro', it is shown that the rate of efflux of hydrogen ions exceeds that of lactate ions by factors of about 14 and 50 for diaphragm and sartorius muscles respectively. This suggests a difference in the mechanisms of transport for these ions. In 'Metabolic intermediates and lactate diffusion in active dog skeletal muscle', it is mentioned that lactate release (La) was measured, but no demonstrable relationship existed between La and either the muscle lactate concentration or muscle-venous lactate concentration gradient. This implies that the movement of lactate out of the muscle may not be solely dependent on a concentration gradient. Therefore, considering these points, it is likely that lactate leaves the muscle via simple diffusion.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
