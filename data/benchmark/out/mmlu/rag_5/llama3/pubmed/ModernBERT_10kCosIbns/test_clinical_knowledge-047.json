["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents discuss steroids, their structures, and activities. The 'soft steroids' mentioned in the first document are designed to be rapidly inactivated by metabolism after performing their therapeutic function. This design approach is based on the 'inactive metabolite approach'. Synthetic modification of natural products is discussed in the second document, with reference to the development of systemic and topical anti-inflammatory agents. There is no direct mention of performance-enhancing steroids or their structures. However, the third document discusses the development of biologically active, totally synthetic steroid hormones since 1941, which could be related to performance-enhancing steroids. The fourth document focuses on the analysis and identification of steroids rather than their structure.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C\n}"]
