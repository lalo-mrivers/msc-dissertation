["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has pulmonary embolism which is a known cause of pulmonary arterial hypertension. The question asks for the most specific indicator of pulmonary arterial hypertension on physical examination. We need to look at the documents provided and see if there's any information about the physical examination findings in patients with pulmonary embolism. In [Thromboembolic pulmonary arterial hypertension], it is mentioned that during acute pulmonary embolism, when the heart and lungs are normal, the mean pulmonary artery pressure never exceeds 40 mmHg. This suggests that a higher pulmonary artery pressure may be present if there's some degree of cardiac or pulmonary disease. In [Pulmonary hypertension secondary to minor pulmonary embolism], it is mentioned that patients with pulmonary embolism had significantly higher pulmonary arterial pressures than normal subjects, which implies that the patient in this case may have an elevated pulmonary artery pressure. Therefore, a sign indicating pulmonary arterial hypertension would be a louder P2 compared to A2 (B).\", \"answer_choice\": B}"]
