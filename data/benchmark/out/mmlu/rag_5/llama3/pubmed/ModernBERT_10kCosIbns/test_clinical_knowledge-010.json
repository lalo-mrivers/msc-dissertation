["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks for the compatible blood types that can be given to a person with a blood group B (rhesus negative). Since the patient has a B antigen, we need to consider the ABO system. Blood type O individuals lack both A and B antigens, so their RBCs will not react with the B antibodies present in the patient's serum. On the other hand, blood types AB and B share the same B antigen as the patient, making them incompatible. Therefore, the only compatible blood type is blood type O.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
