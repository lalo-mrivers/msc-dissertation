["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 37-year-old woman who was found unconscious on her apartment floor. She has a history of drug use (opiates and cocaine) which may have contributed to her condition. Her physical examination shows erythema, warmth, and induration of the upper back, buttocks, and posterior thighs, which suggests that she may have had a prolonged period of lying down or immobility. Her laboratory results show elevated creatine kinase activity (10,300 U/L) which is consistent with muscle damage. She also has pigmented granular casts in her urine, which are often seen in patients who have been unconscious for an extended period. Given these findings, I believe that the patient is at increased risk for rhabdomyolysis-induced acute tubular necrosis.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
