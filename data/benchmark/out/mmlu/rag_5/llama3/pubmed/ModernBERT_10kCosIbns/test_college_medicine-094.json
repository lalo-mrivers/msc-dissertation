["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about muscle lactate production. From the provided documents, it can be seen that lactate metabolism is dependent on the free [NAD+]/[NADH][H+] ratio of cytoplasm. Pyruvate dehydrogenase plays a role in aerobic lactate synthesis by cardiac muscle. It is stated that pyruvate is present in about one-tenth the amount of lactate, and both lactate and its redox partner pyruvate provide information on the metabolic state of tissue. Muscle lactate production increases during normal physiological conditions with increased lactate concentration.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
