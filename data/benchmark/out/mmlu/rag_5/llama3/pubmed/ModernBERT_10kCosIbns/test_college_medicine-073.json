["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"When 10.0 mL of 0.1 M HCl is added to the solution, it will react with the OH- ions present in the solution to form water and release free Mg2+ ions. As a result, the concentration of free Mg2+ ions increases. The Ksp for Mg(OH)2 remains the same because the reaction does not affect the formation constant of the precipitate.\n\nThe pH of the solution will decrease due to the addition of HCl, which will also help in the dissolution of more Mg(OH)2.\n\nNo precipitation occurs as the solution becomes less alkaline and the solubility of Mg(OH)2 increases. The concentration of water molecules remains constant.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
