["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks which substance releases most energy when completely oxidized in the body. Glucose is a simple sugar that provides quick energy to cells through glycolysis. Palmitic acid is a fatty acid that requires more steps and ATP for its complete oxidation, while leucine is an amino acid that also requires multiple steps. The only alcohol mentioned is ethanol, which has no significant role in energy production. Therefore, considering the biochemical pathways involved in energy metabolism, glucose seems to release most energy when completely oxidized.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
