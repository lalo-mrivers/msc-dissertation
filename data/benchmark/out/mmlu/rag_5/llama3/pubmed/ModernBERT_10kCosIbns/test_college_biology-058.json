["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking when the first groups of animals developed lung tissue adequate to support their respiratory requirements without the use of supplementary gas exchange organs. The relevant documents do not explicitly answer this question. However, we can analyze the information provided in the documents.\n\nDocument 1: 'The roles of ventilation and perfusion in lung metabolism.' This document talks about the study on canine lungs following bronchial and/or pulmonary arterial occlusions. It does not provide any information about when animals developed lung tissue adequate to support their respiratory requirements without supplementary gas exchange organs.\n\nDocument 2: 'Postnatal development of the denervated lung in normoxia, hypoxia, or hyperoxia.' This document discusses the study on postnatal development of rat lungs under different oxygen conditions. It does not provide any information about when animals developed lung tissue adequate to support their respiratory requirements without supplementary gas exchange organs.\n\nDocument 3: 'Techniques for drug delivery to the airways, and the assessment of lung function in animal models.' This document provides information on techniques used to assess lung function in animal models, but it does not provide any information about when animals developed lung tissue adequate to support their respiratory requirements without supplementary gas exchange organs.\n\nDocument 4: 'Adaptation of the growing lung to increased oxygen consumption. II. Morphometric analysis.' This document discusses the study on the effect of increased O2 consumption on the lungs of growing animals. It does not provide any information about when animals developed lung tissue adequate to support their respiratory requirements without supplementary gas exchange organs.\n\nDocument 5: '[The role and functions of the lung in equilibrium of the internal milieu. Protein metabolism and enzyme systems].' This document provides information on protein metabolism and enzyme systems in the lung, but it does not provide any information about when animals developed lung tissue adequate to support their respiratory requirements without supplementary gas exchange organs.\n\nSince none of the documents explicitly answer the question, we cannot determine which group of animals developed lung tissue adequate to support their respiratory requirements without supplementary gas exchange organs. Therefore, we should choose an option that is supported by scientific evidence or commonly accepted facts.\n\nThe first groups of animals to develop lung tissue adequate to support their respiratory requirements without supplementary gas exchange organs were likely the amphibians. This is because amphibians are one of the earliest groups of vertebrates to evolve lungs, and they developed functional lungs before other groups like reptiles and mammals.\",\n\n\"answer_choice\": \"A: amphibians\""]
