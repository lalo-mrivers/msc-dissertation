["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the result of setting alpha at 0.01 instead of 0.05 in a placebo-controlled clinical trial to assess the effectiveness of a new antihypertensive drug. This change will affect the power of the study, which is the ability to detect a statistically significant difference between the groups. A lower alpha (0.01) means that we are willing to accept a smaller Type I error rate, which increases the required sample size or decreases the effect size required for significance. Since the study already has 5000 patients, increasing the sample size is not possible. Therefore, the most likely result is an increased likelihood of statistically significant findings.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
