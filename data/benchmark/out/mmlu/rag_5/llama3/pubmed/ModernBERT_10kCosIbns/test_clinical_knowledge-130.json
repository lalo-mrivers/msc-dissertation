["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks when a muscle fiber relaxes. From the provided documents, we can find relevant information about muscle relaxation. In the document 'An electromyographic study of muscle relaxants in man', it is mentioned that stress relaxation is characterized by a remaining higher resting tension. This suggests that the relaxation process may be dependent on the functional conditions underlying the event. In the document 'Stress relaxation compared with relaxation after contraction in smooth muscles', we can see that the time courses of relaxation after contraction and of stress relaxation are different, but both have a sigmoid shape. This implies that muscle fibers relax when...\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
