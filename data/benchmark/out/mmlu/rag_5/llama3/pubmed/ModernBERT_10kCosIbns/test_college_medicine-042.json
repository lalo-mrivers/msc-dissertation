["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the tissue that secretes human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) and its function. From the given documents, we know that hCG is secreted by the blastocyst. According to 'Appearance of hCG in pregnancy plasma following the initiation of implantation of the blastocyst', the first significant rise in plasma hCG occurs 9-13 days after ovulation, indicating that hCG appears in the maternal circulation after the initiation of implantation of the blastocyst. This suggests that the blastocyst is responsible for secreting hCG. Additionally, 'Human chorionic gonadotropin and maternal recognition of pregnancy' mentions that hCG appears to be essential for sustained secretion of progesterone by the corpus luteum, particularly during the first three weeks after fertilization. This implies that hCG has a function in maintaining pregnancy.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
