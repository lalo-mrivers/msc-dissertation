["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks what happens when an action potential arrives at the motor endplate. The relevant documents discuss the neuromuscular junction and the release of neurotransmitters. According to the document 'Drug interactions at the motor endplate', agonists applied either iontophoretically or in the bath produce currents at the endplate, which can be accounted for by postulating independent binding and conformation change in 2 equivalent receptor subunits. This suggests that an action potential arriving at the motor endplate causes release of acetylcholine.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
