["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the best description of the Golgi tendon organ. The relevant documents discuss the morphology and function of the Golgi tendon organ as a sensory receptor that responds to force applied to a muscle's tendon. The mechanical events described in the first document suggest that it may function as a biological force transducer under static loading conditions. The studies on motor units activating single Golgi tendon organs (Heterogeneity of motor units activating single Golgi tendon organs) show that individual Golgi tendon organs can signal the contraction of multiple motor units with different physiological properties. This suggests that the Golgi tendon organ is sensitive to muscle force and can detect changes in muscle length. The responses of isolated Golgi tendon organs also support this idea, as they respond to stretch and have a threshold force required for sustained afferent discharge.\n\nBased on these findings, the best description of the Golgi tendon organ is a proprioceptive sensory receptor found at the junction between muscle and tendon.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
