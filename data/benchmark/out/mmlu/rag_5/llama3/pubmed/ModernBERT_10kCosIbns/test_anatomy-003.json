["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking which structure is derived from ectomesenchyme. We can analyze the provided documents to find the relevant information. The document 'Course of development of isolated rat embryonic ectoderm as renal homograft' mentions that isolated head-fold stage rat embryonic ectoderm grafted under the kidney capsule gives rise to a new mesenchyme with the capacity to differentiate into mesodermal tissues. This suggests that ectomesenchyme is involved in the formation of mesodermal tissues. The question asks about which structure is derived from ectomesenchyme, and it is likely that the answer would be related to mesodermal tissues.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
