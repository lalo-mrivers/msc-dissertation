["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents provide information on pre-mRNA processing and gene expression in eukaryotes. The primary transcript is processed into secondary pre-mRNAs by extragenic cleavage and intragenic splicing, giving rise to functional mRNA. This process involves chemical modifications such as methylation, capping, and polyadenylation. According to the text, the 3' Poly A tail is added during this processing stage.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
