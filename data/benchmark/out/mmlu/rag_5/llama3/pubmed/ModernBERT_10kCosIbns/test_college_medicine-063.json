["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking which phases are common to cells undergoing meiosis and mitosis. According to the provided documents, we can see that the preleptotene condensation stage was described in human foetal testis and could be related to the processes of meiotic initiation. Mitotic factors from mammalian cells induce germinal vesicle breakdown and chromosome condensation in amphibian oocytes, suggesting that the factors that regulate the breakdown of nuclear membrane and chromosome condensation during mitosis, meiosis, appear to be very similar, if not identical, throughout the animal kingdom. Temperature limits of mitosis in mammalian cell cultures suggest that different strains of cells reacted to the increase or decrease in temperature in a dissimilar way, but cell division did not end with the temperature fall by over 10 degrees. Biochemistry of meiosis highlights some physiological stages and metabolic characteristics specific to meiosis.\n\nFrom these documents, we can see that preleptotene condensation stage is related to meiotic initiation, mitotic factors induce germinal vesicle breakdown and chromosome condensation in amphibian oocytes, temperature limits of mitosis suggest cell division does not end with the temperature fall by over 10 degrees. This information suggests that both meiosis and mitosis have G2 phase as a common phase.\n\nBased on this analysis, we can conclude that cells undergoing meiosis and mitosis share some common phases.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C: II and III only\""]
