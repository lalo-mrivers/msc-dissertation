["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question states that MAPs (most notably MAP2 and MAP tau) act to stabilize microtubules. Since a mutant is developed that vastly reduced function across all families of MAPs, leading to increased microtubule degradation, it can be inferred that the microtubules are no longer being stabilized. Microtubules play a crucial role in the process of neuronal morphogenesis and axonal transport. Therefore, the most affected cellular activity would likely be\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: Meiosis\"\n}"]
