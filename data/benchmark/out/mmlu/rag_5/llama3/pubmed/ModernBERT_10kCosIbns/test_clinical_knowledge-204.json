["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the provided documents, it can be inferred that peripheral neuropathy can have various presentations. The first document discusses a morphological study of human peroneal nerves and mentions diabetes as one of the risk factors. The second document provides an overview of peripheral nerve disorders and their diagnosis. The third document highlights the treatment options for acute and chronic polyneuropathies, including plasma exchanges and intravenous human plasma immunoglobulins. The fourth document discusses vasculitic neuropathy, which can present as a distal symmetric polyneuropathy or an overlapping multiple mononeuropathy. Finally, the fifth document emphasizes the importance of clarifying the etiology of peripheral neuropathy.\n\nConsidering these documents, it can be deduced that sensory loss may not necessarily follow a stocking distribution in all cases of peripheral neuropathy. The tone is also unlikely to be increased bilaterally in the legs, as polyneuropathies often present with weakness and sensory loss rather than an increase in tone. Reflexes are typically decreased or absent in peripheral neuropathy, rather than being very brisk with reinforcement.\n\nThe correct answer is A: Sensory loss is demonstrated in a stocking distribution.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
