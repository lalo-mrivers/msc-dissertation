["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the muscles active during quiet inspiration. We need to find relevant information from the given documents. Document [Relationship between the control of the duration of inspiration and the resting ventilation pattern in conscious man] mentions breathing patterns, but not specific muscles. Documents [Respiratory responses to simultaneous static and rhythmic exercises in humans], [Synchronous electric activity with inspiration in the vastus lateralis muscle of the anesthesied dog breathing spontaneously], and [Respiratory ventilation during muscular contraction in man] provide information about respiratory responses, but do not directly address quiet inspiration. Document [The functional organization of the respiratory phase-switching mechanisms] does not mention specific muscles either. Therefore, we cannot find direct answers from these documents. Let's look at general knowledge about breathing patterns. Quiet inspiration is characterized by slow and shallow breathing. The main muscle responsible for this type of breathing is the diaphragm. Intercostal muscles also play a role in quiet inspiration, but they are not the primary movers. Based on our analysis, we can conclude that...\", \"answer_choice\": D}"]
