["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for the statistical power of the study. Statistical power is the probability that a statistically significant difference will be detected between two groups (in this case, Drug X and standard therapy) when there truly is a difference. The investigators have set the probability of wrongly finding that Drug X is more effective than the standard therapy as 1% (α error), and the probability of wrongly finding that the effectiveness of the two drugs is the same as 10% (β error). This suggests that the study is designed to detect a significant difference between the two groups. Therefore, the statistical power of the study would be high.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D\n}"]
