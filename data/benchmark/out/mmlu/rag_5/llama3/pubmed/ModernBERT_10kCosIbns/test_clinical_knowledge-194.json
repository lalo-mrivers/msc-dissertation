["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant document that describes the resynthesis of phosphocreatine after exercise is 'ATP and phosphocreatine changes in single human muscle fibers after intense electrical stimulation'. This study shows that PCr content in type I fibers at rest was 72.3 +/- 4.50 mmol/kg dry muscle, and after exercise, it was depleted. After the 60 s of recovery the PCr content in type I fibers was significantly higher compared with type II fibers, but, after 5 min of oxidative recovery, the PCr levels were equal in the two fiber types.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
