["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, we need to evaluate the family history. The patient has a brother and maternal uncle with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) who died at ages 28 and 17 years, respectively. This suggests that there is a significant risk of DMD in the patient's family. Next, we look at the patient's creatine kinase concentration, which is 120 U/L. According to the documents, values higher than 250 mU/ml are compatible with being a carrier of DMD in 99% of cases. However, normal values do not distinguish between healthy and carrier populations. Therefore, the patient's creatine kinase concentration alone does not provide conclusive evidence for or against her being a carrier. Finally, we consider the mother's serum muscle creatine kinase concentration, which is 300 U/L. This suggests that the mother is a carrier of DMD.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
