["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the provided documents, it can be seen that the Golgi apparatus is characterized by various enzymes such as NADH- and NADPH-cytochrome c reductases, glucose-6-phosphatase, thiamine pyrophosphatase, acid phosphatase, 5'-nucleotidase, and galactosyltransferase. These enzymes have different partition patterns in aqueous polymer two-phase systems compared to those associated with microsomes or lysosomes. This suggests that these enzymes are inherently associated with the Golgi apparatus and not due to contamination from other organelles. Additionally, the markers for the Golgi apparatus are immunologically identical with those of microsomes and behave differently in sucrose density gradient centrifugation. Furthermore, glycosylation of certain secretory proteins is thought to occur within the Golgi apparatus, as revealed by immunolabeling and cytochemistry techniques.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
