["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The concept of metabolic deviations suggests that metabolism is influenced by systems rather than individual components. The documents also emphasize the dynamic character of metabolite patterns as a function of physiological or environmental conditions and highlight the importance of feedback mechanisms in maintaining homeostasis. Additionally, the discussion on time hierarchy and non-equilibrium in metabolic systems shows that metabolism is characterized by complex interactions between biochemical reactions with different characteristic times. Therefore, it can be inferred that metabolism is determined by the interactions between various systems, components, and feedback mechanisms rather than a single factor.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
