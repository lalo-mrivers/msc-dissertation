["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the initial energy source for very high force contractions lasting 1-2 seconds. In the 'Myocardial oxygen consumption in isometric contraction of various strengths due to paired stimulation and quick-release' paper, it's mentioned that the oxygen consumption during isometric contraction was dependent solely upon the magnitude of active tension developed, and not on the rate of tension development or on the duration of contraction. This suggests that the energy source is related to the force rather than the duration. The 'Energy and muscular contraction' paper explains how the conversion of chemical energy into mechanical energy occurs through ions movement and conformational changes of enzymes involved in the process. For very high force contractions, it's likely that the initial energy source comes from a fast-twitching muscle fiber system, which relies heavily on phosphocreatine stores. This is supported by the 'Muscle as a thermodynamic machine' paper, where estimates of efficiency of transduction vary between 45 to 66%, suggesting that ATP stores are sufficient but not necessarily the primary energy source for high-force contractions.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
