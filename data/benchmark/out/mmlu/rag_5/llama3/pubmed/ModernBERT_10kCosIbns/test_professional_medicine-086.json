["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a healthy 4-year-old girl with a grade 2/6 systolic ejection murmur along the upper left sternal border. Additionally, she has a soft mid-diastolic murmur along the lower left sternal border. The presence of S2 that does not vary with respiration suggests that the murmur is functional. Given these findings, we can consider functional murmurs and exclude organic murmurs such as Aortic stenosis (C), Coarctation of the aorta (C) which would be associated with other signs of cardiac failure or hypertension. Mitral valve prolapse (D) could also be excluded due to the absence of other abnormal findings. Therefore, considering the age and clinical presentation, the most likely diagnosis is Atrial septal defect (B).\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
