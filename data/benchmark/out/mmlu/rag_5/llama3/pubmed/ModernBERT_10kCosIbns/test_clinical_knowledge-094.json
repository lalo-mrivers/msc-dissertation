["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe chemical cyanosis as an oxygen transport deficiency. Chemical cyanosis can be evaluated by methemoglobin determinations or oxygen saturation readings. No changes would have been made in medical management of patients if the decisions had been made on the basis of oxygen saturation level of less than 90%. This suggests that a patient with cyanosis may have an oxygen saturation level below 90%. Therefore, we can eliminate options A and B as they indicate normal or above-normal oxygen saturation levels. Options C and D both include the possibility of low oxygen saturation levels, but option C specifically states '80% or below', which is consistent with the information provided.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
