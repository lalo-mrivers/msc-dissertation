["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The key attribute in successful marathon running can be inferred by analyzing the relevant documents. Marathon running requires endurance and stamina, as evident from the changes in serum electrolyte levels during marathon running that suggest a highly significant fall in serum magnesium concentration with an increase in both potassium and sodium levels. Similarly, cardio-respiratory and perceptual recovery from a marathon run shows that aerobic capacity was not a limiting factor in the recovery from a marathon run, but muscle soreness and stiffness seem to be related to the increased perceptual ratings following a marathon run. The study on oxygen uptake measurements during competitive marathon running also suggests that energy expenditures requiring 68-100% of VO2 max were confirmed. Therefore, stamina is likely the key attribute in successful marathon running.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
