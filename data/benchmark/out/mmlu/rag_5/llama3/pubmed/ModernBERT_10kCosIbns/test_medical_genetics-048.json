["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the proportion of genes shared by first cousins. We need to consider the genetic information provided earlier. The relevant document is 'Application of a recombination model in calculating the variance of sib pair genetic identity.' This article discusses the calculation of the variance in the proportion of genes identical by descent shared by two sibs, which includes siblings and half-siblings (like first cousins). The standard deviation for the 22 human autosomes is reported to be 0.040. We can't directly use this information for first cousins, but we can infer that the proportion of genes shared between first cousins would likely be less than the proportion shared between full siblings.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: 1.0/16\"\n}"]
