["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Anaerobic metabolism refers to the generation of ATP through energy transformation mechanisms that do not involve oxygen. According to the documents, anaerobic phosphorylation was first detected in anaerobic energy-yielding reactions and soon found in respiratory and photosynthetic energy production. The mechanism by which energy derived from metabolites was converted into phosphate-bond energy in the latter processes appeared to differ from that of anaerobic energy transmission. Anaerobic metabolism does not require oxygen, but rather uses alternative mechanisms such as phosphorylated compounds to generate ATP.\", \"answer_choice\": C}"]
