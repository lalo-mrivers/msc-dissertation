["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to the document 'Branching of sensory axons in the dorsal root and evidence for the absence of dorsal root efferent fibers', it is stated that there are more dorsal root axons than dorsal root ganglion cells. This suggests that the excess fibers must branch in the dorsal root, indicating that the dorsal roots of all spinal nerves contain sensory neuronal processes.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
