["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the propagation of action potentials in neurons, ion channels, and synaptic transmission. The point at which an impulse is transmitted from one neuron to another is described as a 'synaptic connection' where neurotransmitters and hormones act via G-protein-coupled pathways for neuromodulation. This process involves changes in membrane permeability, the flow of ions across the membrane, and the generation of action potentials.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
