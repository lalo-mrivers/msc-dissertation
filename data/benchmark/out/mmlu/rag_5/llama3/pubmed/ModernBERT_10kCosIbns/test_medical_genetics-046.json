["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the phenomenon where one genotype can give rise to different physiological or morphological states in response to environmental conditions during development. The provided documents talk about gene interactions, Mendelian inheritance, and genetic variations. From the principles of genetics applied to medicine, we know that genes and environment interact continuously throughout life to regulate human structure and function. This implies that the same genotype can give rise to different physiological or morphological states in response to environmental conditions. Therefore, the answer is likely related to developmental plasticity.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
