["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant document for this question is 'Measuring exercise-induced adaptations and injury with magnetic resonance spectroscopy'. According to this study, endurance training resulted in a 14% increase in metabolic capacity. Metabolic capacity was measured as the rate of phosphocreatine (PCr) recovery following submaximal exercise. Therefore, endurance training increases the muscle's capacity to recover phosphocreatine after exercise.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C: burn fat and carbohydrate.\""]
