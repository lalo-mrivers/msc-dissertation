["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Since the mice are genetically modified to lose their hearing, we can't directly compare their responses to human audiograms. However, we can analyze the study 'A model describing nonlinearities in hearing by active processes with saturation at 40 dB' that suggests a dynamic range in neurophysiology and psychoacoustics up to 40 dB. This value is not explicitly mentioned as absolute threshold but it can serve as a reference point.\n\nComparing this value to the given power levels, we see that 80% power is above the 40 dB mark, while 70% and 60% are below it. Therefore, it's unlikely that the absolute threshold corresponds to either of these power levels.\n\nThe study 'Comparison of unaided MCLs and use-gain of hearing aids' provides information on minimum audible level (MCL) for narrow bands of noise, but it does not directly apply to this specific experiment or provide a clear benchmark for absolute threshold.\n\nConsidering the available studies and data, we cannot determine the exact power level corresponding to the absolute threshold. However, based on the reference point provided by the 'nonlinearities in hearing' study, it's plausible that the absolute threshold might be below 60% power.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: Not enough information given.\""]
