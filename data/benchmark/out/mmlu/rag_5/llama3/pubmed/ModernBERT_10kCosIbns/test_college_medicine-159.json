["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the provided documents, anaerobic metabolism refers to the generation of ATP without the use of oxygen. This is stated explicitly in the document 'The roots of bioenergetics' as 'storage of energy in ATP was first detected in anaerobic energy-yielding reactions'. Additionally, in the document 'Homeostatic regulation of cellular energy metabolism', it is mentioned that under conditions of constant energy demand, changes in the intracellular phosphate concentration cause an adjustment in the [ATP]/[ADP] to maintain a constant [ATP]/[ADP][Pi] and constant respiratory rate. This suggests that anaerobic metabolism is not dependent on oxygen.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
