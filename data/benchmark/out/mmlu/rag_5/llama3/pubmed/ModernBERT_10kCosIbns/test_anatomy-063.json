["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about blood flow from the right ventricle. We can look at the relevant documents for clues. The first document talks about the establishment of blood flow from the right ventricle to the pulmonary artery during diastole, which suggests a connection between the two. The second document describes a modified Langendorff technique that shows a small amount of fluid reaching the surface of the heart via the interstitial space, which implies that some fluid is flowing out of the right ventricle. Finally, the fourth document talks about angiographic measurements of right ventricular volumes and ejection fraction, which suggests that blood flows from the right ventricle into the pulmonary arteries.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
