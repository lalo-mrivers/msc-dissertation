["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the provided documents, we know that pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) is located within the inner mitochondrial membrane. Therefore, it is not possible for PDC to be located in the sarcoplasm (A), as this would imply it is extramitochondrial. We also know that PDC catalyzes the conversion of pyruvate to acetyl CoA (B). The other options, C and D, do not match the function described in the documents.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
