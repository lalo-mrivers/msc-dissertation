["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks what stabilizes the unique coiled structure of an alpha helix. From the provided documents, we can see that Presta and Rose proposed that a necessary condition for helix formation is the presence of residues at the N- and C-termini (called NTBs and CTBs) whose side chains can form hydrogen bonds with the initial four amides and the last four carbonyls of the helix. Side chain-backbone hydrogen bonding also contributes to helix stability in peptides derived from an alpha-helical region of carboxypeptidase A. Additionally, the energy contribution of solvent-exposed ion pairs to alpha-helix structure is useful for deciphering how proteins fold and for predicting folded structures of proteins from their sequence. This suggests that hydrogen bonding between the peptide backbone atoms plays a significant role in stabilizing the unique coiled structure of an alpha helix.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
