["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, we need to determine the number of moles of ethane. The given mass is 84g, so we'll divide it by the molecular weight of ethane (C2H4). Molecular weight = 12amu + 4*1amu = 30amu. Now, 1 mole of C2H4 has a mass of 30amu. So, to find the number of moles, we'll divide 84g by 30amu.\n\nmoles = mass / molecular weight\n= 84g / 30amu\n= approximately 2.8 mol\n\nNext, we need to determine the limiting reagent. In this case, it's oxygen, since there is a fixed amount of ethane but an unlimited amount of oxygen. The balanced reaction will have a stoichiometry of:\n\n1 C2H4 + 3 O2 â†’ 2 CO2 + 2 H2O\n\nNow, let's calculate the number of moles of oxygen required for the reaction:\n\nmoles = mass / molecular weight\n= (mass of oxygen) / (molecular weight of oxygen)\n= (mass of oxygen) / 32amu (since oxygen has a molecular weight of 16amu * 2)\n\nWe'll assume that the given amount is in grams, so we'll convert it to moles:\n\nmoles = mass / molecular weight\n= 84g / 32amu\n= approximately 2.6 mol\n\nNow, let's compare the number of moles of oxygen required with the available amount:\n\nAvailable moles = 2.8 mol (ethane) * 3 (stoichiometry) = 8.4 mol\n\nRequired moles = 2.6 mol (oxygen)\n\nSince the required moles are less than the available moles, we can conclude that oxygen is not limiting.\n\nNow, let's calculate the number of moles of CO2 produced:\n\nmoles = 1 mole ethane * 1/1.5 (stoichiometry) = approximately 0.67 mol\n\nFinally, we'll multiply this by the molecular weight of CO2 to get the mass:\n\nmass = moles * molecular weight\n= 0.67 mol * 44amu (since CO2 has a molecular weight of 12amu + 16amu * 2)\n= approximately 29.48g\n\nThe given options are A: 78g, B: 528g, C: 264g, and D: 156g. None of these match the calculated value of approximately 29.48g. The correct answer would be a value close to this.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
