["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The key to understanding sensory adaptation is to identify the concepts mentioned in the provided documents. In 'Informational and neural adaptation curves are asynchronous', it is stated that informational adaptation occurs more rapidly than neural adaptation, indicating that the process of adapting to a stimulus happens at different rates for the entire organism versus individual sensory neurons. This suggests that adaptation can occur at multiple levels, from peripheral sense-organs to central transmission structures. In 'An hypothesis on information, memory and perception', it is postulated that uncertainty about an external event produces neural activity, which implies that adaptation may be related to changes in uncertainty or familiarity with a stimulus. Finally, 'Adaptation and affect: toward a synthesis of Piagetian and psychoanalytic psychologies' discusses the concept of assimilation and accommodation as being theoretically independent, but still influencing each other. Considering these concepts, we can infer that sensory adaptation refers to the process by which an organism adjusts its perception or response to a stimulus over time.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
