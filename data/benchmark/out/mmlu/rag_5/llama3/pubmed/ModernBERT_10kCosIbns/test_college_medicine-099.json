["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to the document 'Muscle structure and function--an explanation', contraction takes place by a sliding filament mechanism produced by cross-bridges which form between thick and thin filaments. Control is exercised by tropomyosin and troponin. When the calcium concentration is low, these proteins interfere with the formation of cross-bridges and prevent contraction, but when the calcium concentration is increased, they no longer interfere and contraction proceeds.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: calcium binding to troponin.\""]
