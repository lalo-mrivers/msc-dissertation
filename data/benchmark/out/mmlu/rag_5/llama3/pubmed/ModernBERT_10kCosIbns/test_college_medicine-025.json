["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the result of a point mutation and deletion on the original DNA sequence, we need to analyze the possible mutations that can occur at each position. The original sequence is 5’ – GGATCCTCATG – 3’. A point mutation could be a substitution, insertion or deletion of a single nucleotide.\n\nThe first base 'G' could undergo a substitution, insertion or deletion, resulting in options A, B or C for the first two bases. However, since the question specifies both a point mutation and a deletion, we need to consider deletions that occur at any position.\n\nA deletion could occur at the 5th or 6th position (GGATC-CTCATG), resulting in option D. Therefore, the correct answer is D: 5’ – GGATCCATG – 3’.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
