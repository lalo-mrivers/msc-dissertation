["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks which molecule does not form part of DNA. We can look at the given documents to find out what makes up DNA. From the 'DNA - a computer model' document, we know that DNA is composed of nucleotide bases. The 'Chemical synthesis of restriction enzyme recognition sites useful for cloning' and '3'-Mercapto-2',3'-dideoxynucleotides are high effective terminators of DNA synthesis catalyzed by HIV reverse transcriptase' documents also mention DNA being composed of nucleotides. Therefore, we can conclude that the molecule that does not form part of DNA is an amino acid.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
