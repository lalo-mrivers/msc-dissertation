["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks how many micrograms is each dose of Ropinirole, which is prescribed as 1.5 mg divided into three doses. To find the answer, we need to convert milligrams (mg) to micrograms (mcg). There are 1000 mcg in 1 mg. So, if we divide the total amount of Ropinirole by the number of doses, and then multiply it by 1000, we will get the answer.\n\nFirst, let's find the total amount of Ropinirole in micrograms: 1.5 mg * 1000 mcg/mg = 1500 mcg\n\nNext, let's divide this amount by the number of doses: 1500 mcg รท 3 = 500 mcg per dose\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
