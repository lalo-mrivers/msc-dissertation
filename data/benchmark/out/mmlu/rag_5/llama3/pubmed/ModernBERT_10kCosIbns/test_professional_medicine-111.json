["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 40-year-old female secretary with a 2-month history of fatigue, generalized aching and weakness of the proximal muscles of all four extremities. The symptoms started with difficulty getting in and out of her car, but have progressed to difficulties combing her hair. She also has aching of the joints in her hands that responded partially to ibuprofen. Physical examination shows cracking of the skin on both hands, tender muscles on upper arms and legs, elevated creatine kinase concentration (600 U/L), and elevated lactate dehydrogenase concentration (800 U/L). The symptoms are more related to muscle weakness rather than pain, which makes fibromyalgia less likely. Myasthenia gravis is also unlikely because the patient's symptoms are not triggered by specific activities or emotions. Polymyositis is a possibility given the elevated enzyme levels and muscle tenderness. Scleroderma is an autoimmune disorder that primarily affects the skin and blood vessels, which does not seem to fit with this patient's symptoms.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
