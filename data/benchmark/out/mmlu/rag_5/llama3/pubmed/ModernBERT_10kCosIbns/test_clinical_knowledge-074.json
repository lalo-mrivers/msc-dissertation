["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about muscle lactate production. According to the document 'Aerobic lactate synthesis by cardiac muscle', aerobic lactate synthesis is absolutely dependent upon the availability of extracellular pyruvate. This suggests that when pyruvate is present, it can be converted into lactate through the reaction catalyzed by lactate dehydrogenase. The other options do not provide a direct link between pyruvate and lactate production.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
