["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question states that Acute Myeloid Leukemia is a malignant cancer in which myeloid progenitor cells become rapidly dividing and retain their semi-stem cell state. This means that the abnormal stem cell will differentiate into myeloid cells, not lymphoid or T cells. Among the options, B: Platelet does not seem to fit as platelets are formed from megakaryocytes, not myeloid progenitor cells. Therefore, we need to look at options A and D. The question also states that under normal circumstances, which of the following cell types would arise from this stem cell? This implies that we are looking for a normal or physiological response. In this case, option C: T cell is unlikely as it is not a typical myeloid progenitor cell outcome. Option A: NK cell is an immune cell type and is also not a direct product of myeloid progenitor cells. Therefore, the correct answer is D: Lymphoid progenitor.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
