["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about techniques to demonstrate protein binding to specific DNA sequences. The relevant documents describe various methods for studying protein-DNA interactions. The first method uses a polymerase chain reaction assisted binding site selection method (BSS) to determine the recognition-sequences for DNA-binding proteins. This involves immobilizing the protein on nitrocellulose filters and exposing it to a pool of double-stranded oligonucleotides carrying random sequences. Oligonucleotides retained by the DNA-binding protein are liberated, amplified by PCR, and cloned for determination of the DNA sequence selected by the protein.\n\nAnother method is DNAse footprinting, which involves partial degradation of a 5' end-labelled, double-stranded DNA segment in the presence and absence of the binding protein. The protective 'footprint' of the binding protein on the DNA sequence can be visualized by electrophoresis and autoradiography.\n\nA third method uses gel mobility-shift assay for DNA-protein interaction to isolate specific genomic DNA sequences recognized by DNA-binding proteins. This involves restriction enzyme digestion, size fractionation, DNA-protein binding, ligation, transformation of Escherichia coli, and screening of recombinant clones for inserts containing specific DNA-protein binding sequences.\n\nFinally, a simple method is offered for detection of DNA-binding proteins, which involves electrophoretic separation in sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gel containing labeled DNA, followed by washing the gel to remove SDS and allow protein renaturation. Protein-free DNA is washed out, remaining with the DNA-binding proteins that restored their original characteristic.\n\nGiven these methods, Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (D) seems to be a technique that could be used to demonstrate protein binding to specific DNA sequences.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
