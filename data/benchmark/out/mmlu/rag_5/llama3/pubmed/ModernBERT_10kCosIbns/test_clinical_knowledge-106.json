["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the sex of a child. The relevant documents mention nothing about the number of X chromosomes from the mother (A) or recessive allele on the X chromosome (B). The sex ratio is mentioned in the secondary sex ratio document, but it doesn't imply that the sex of a child is dictated by the inheritance of one factor only. Cytogenetic tests are used to prove paternity in cases of incest, which involves the study of chromosomal markers, not the mother's X chromosomes. Therefore, options A and B can be ruled out.
