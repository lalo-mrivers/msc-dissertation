["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to [The external pterygoid muscle. Functional aspects], the study aimed to evaluate the lateral pterygoid muscle as a single unit compared to its function. It highlights that every block was fixed in solution of 10% formalin and dissections were made to show every components of articulation. The purpose of the study was to examine the anatomic function of the lateral pterygoid muscle.\n\nFurthermore, [Longitudinal growth of the lateral pterygoid muscle in human fetuses] reveals that the lower head of the muscle is always longer than the upper one. This indicates that there might be a difference in the attachment sites or functions of the two heads.\n\nLooking at [Histological observations on structure of endomysium, perimysium and epimysium of lateral pterygoid muscle in rat], we can see that the lateral pterygoid muscle consists of two parts. The superior head originates from the basisphenoid and is mainly inserted into the articular disk and capsule. The inferior head originates from the lateral pterygoid processus and is mainly inserted into the condylar processus of the mandible.\n\nFinally, considering [Electromyography after lateral pterygoid myotomy in monkeys], we can see that the activity characteristics of the lateral pterygoid muscle were recorded as early as four days postoperatively. By the end of the second postoperative month, bilateral lateral pterygoid muscle activity was demonstrated in all animals.\n\nBased on these findings, it seems clear that the lateral pterygoid muscle is attached to the condylar process and protrudes the mandible.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
