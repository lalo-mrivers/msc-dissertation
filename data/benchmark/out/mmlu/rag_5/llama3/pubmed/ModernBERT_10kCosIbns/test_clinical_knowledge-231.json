["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe physiological responses to exercise. The 'Physiological responses to maximal intermittent exercise' study compares endurance-trained runners and games players during a multiple sprint test. It reports higher peak power output and speed for games players, but also greater decrement in mean power output and higher blood lactate levels after the test. This suggests that games players may rely more heavily on anaerobic metabolism during high-intensity exercise.\n\nThe 'Cardiovascular limitations of active recovery from strenuous exercise' study shows that cycling recovery can lead to arterial hypotension, elevated heart rate, and reduced forearm hyperaemia. This is different from passive rest, where no such changes occur. The study suggests that this may be due to plasma fluid loss and additional vasodilation.\n\nThe 'Quantification of T- and H-responses before and after a period of endurance training' study shows that endurance training can influence not only the excitability of motoneurons but also the response of muscle receptors to stretch.\n\nBased on these studies, it is likely that the first fibre types to fatigue during all-out exercise such as sprinting are Type IIa fibres or Type IIX fibres. These fibre types are more suited for high-intensity, short-duration exercises and rely more heavily on anaerobic metabolism.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
