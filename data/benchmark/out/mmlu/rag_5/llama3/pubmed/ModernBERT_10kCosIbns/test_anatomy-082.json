["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the circulation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) around the brain. The relevant document is 'Cerebrospinal fluid flow. I. Physiology of cardiac-related pulsation.' It states that in the spinal canal, oscillating caudad motion precedes flow from the third to the fourth ventricle by about 50-100 ms and is superimposed on a bulk flow, which moves simultaneously in opposite directions in separate subarachnoid channels; it is directed mainly caudally in the anterior cervical subarachnoid space. This suggests that CSF circulates around the brain between the arachnoid and pia maters.\", \"answer_choice\": C}"]
