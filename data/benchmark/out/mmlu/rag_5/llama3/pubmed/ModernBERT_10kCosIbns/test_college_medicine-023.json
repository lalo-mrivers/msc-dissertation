["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks which process uses the gradient of material to control the direction in which the material moves across the cell membrane. From the given documents, we can see that there is a mention of 'membrane fluidity gradient model of cell transport' which suggests that the movement of materials across the cell membrane is controlled by the difference in membrane fluidity between the two sides of the membrane. This means that the direction of movement is determined by the gradient of material.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
