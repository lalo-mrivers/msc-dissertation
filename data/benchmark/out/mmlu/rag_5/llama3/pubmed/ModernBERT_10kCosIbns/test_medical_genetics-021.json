["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents discuss X-inactivation patterns in humans. The report on a male with two contiguous inactivation centers on a single X chromosome suggests that the duplicated region is not subject to X-inactivation, despite the presence of two XICs. This implies that X-chromosome inactivation does not necessarily result in the same X chromosome being inactive in all cells of a female. Additionally, the study on X-autosomal translocations and the methylation patterns at the hypervariable X-chromosome locus DXS255 suggest that there is more complexity to X-inactivation than previously thought.\",\n\"answer_choice\": A\n}"]
