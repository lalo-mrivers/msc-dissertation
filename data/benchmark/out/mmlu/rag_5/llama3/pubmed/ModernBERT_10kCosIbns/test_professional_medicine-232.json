["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has mild asthma that is exacerbated by allergens. He uses his albuterol inhaler one to two times daily for wheezing and chest tightness. Given his physical activity level, it's possible that exercise may be contributing to the increased symptoms. The patient also has a history of atopic allergies to pollen and cats.\n\nThe patient does not have any concerning symptoms such as gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), productive cough, or fever. His vital signs are normal, except for scattered rhonchi and wheezes with forced expiration.\n\nBased on the patient's history and physical examination, it's likely that his asthma is primarily driven by inflammation. Inhaled corticosteroids are a good choice to control inflammation and prevent exacerbations.\n\nThe peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) of 240 L/min suggests that the patient's airway obstruction is mild to moderate. Given this, adding a long-acting bronchodilator may not be necessary at this time.\n\nIncreasing the use of albuterol inhaler may provide temporary relief but will not address the underlying inflammation.\n\nA chest x-ray is not necessary for this patient as there are no concerning symptoms or physical examination findings that would suggest pneumonia or other pulmonary pathology.\n\nFexofenadine therapy is not indicated at this time, as the patient's symptoms are primarily related to asthma and not allergies.\n\nInitiation of a daily corticosteroid inhaler is the most appropriate management for this patient. It will help control inflammation and prevent exacerbations.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
