["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents describe the effects of bleeding on cardiovascular and metabolic changes. The first study discusses the haemodynamic and metabolic responses to acute haemorrhage. It suggests that bleeding causes an elevation in total peripheral resistance and reduction in tissue perfusion, leading to a decrease in oxygen consumption and alkalosis secondary to impaired carbon dioxide production. When bleeding ceases, these changes partially reverse. This provides information on the effects of bleeding on cardiovascular and metabolic changes. The second study discusses tissue oxygenation during hypovolaemic shock. It highlights that correction of cardiac index and arterial PO2 does not necessarily ensure a normal tissue PO2. Tissue PO2 levels provide an excellent index of peripheral perfusion.\n\nThe third study examines the haemodynamic and metabolic effects which follow the infusion of blood in experimental hypovolaemia. It suggests that initial reinfusion is associated with rapid improvement in haemodynamic and metabolic status, but mean arterial pH falls because carbon dioxide production increases. Maximum metabolically effective tissue perfusion was probably attained in phase II.\n\nThe fourth study examines the influence of hypovolaemic shock on the arterial blood flow and metabolism of the liver. It suggests that during hypovolaemic shock, the flowrate of the hepatic artery decreases.\n\nThe fifth study discusses the effects of hypoxia and hypotension on oxygen delivery in the brain. It highlights that failure of microvascular re-perfusion is not supported by these findings.\n\nBased on these studies, we can conclude that bleeding causes cardiovascular and metabolic changes that are reversible when bleeding ceases. The degree of blood loss before it affects heart rate and blood pressure is unclear from this information.\n\nThe answer choice options provided do not directly relate to the effects of bleeding on cardiovascular and metabolic changes in hypovolaemic shock. Therefore, we cannot determine a percentage of blood loss based solely on these studies.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
