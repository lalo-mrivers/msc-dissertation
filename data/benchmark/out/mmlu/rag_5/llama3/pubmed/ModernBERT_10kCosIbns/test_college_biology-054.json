["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking which factor does NOT promote linkage disequilibrium. Linkage disequilibrium occurs when the combination of alleles at two or more loci deviates from the expected frequency based on their individual frequencies. Factors that promote linkage disequilibrium include epistasis, coadapted gene complexes, and genetic drift. Asexual reproduction is a mechanism of evolution that does not directly affect linkage disequilibrium. Random mating is also unlikely to have a significant impact on linkage disequilibrium, as it refers to the random combination of alleles during meiosis.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
