["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The problem is about the Doppler effect. When an object moves relative to an observer, the frequency of a sound emitted by that object changes. The formula for this change is: f' = f * (v + v0) / (v - v0), where f' is the perceived frequency, f is the normal frequency, v is the velocity of the camera platform, and v0 is the velocity of the actor inside the car. We are given that the normal frequency is 800 Hz, the velocity of the actor is 108 km/h, and the velocity of the camera platform is 72 km/h. The first step is to convert all velocities into meters per second: 108 km/h = 30.4 m/s, 72 km/h = 20 m/s.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
