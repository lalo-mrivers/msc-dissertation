["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents provided discuss various aspects of microorganisms, including their growth conditions, biotechnological applications, and biochemical mechanisms. Chemosynthetic bacteria are mentioned as deriving energy by oxidizing or reducing inorganic substances such as ammonia, sulfur, or hydrogen. This information is consistent with the process of chemosynthesis, where bacteria use chemical reactions to generate energy. Based on this understanding, it can be inferred that chemosynthetic bacteria derive energy by oxidizing or reducing inorganic substances.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A: oxidizing inorganic substances such as ammonia, sulfur, or hydrogen\"\n}"]
