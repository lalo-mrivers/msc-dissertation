["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"After reviewing the provided documents, I noticed that none of them specifically discuss statistics or data related to informal carers. However, one of the papers mentions a project designed to establish the extent to which carers are equipped to fulfill their role in terms of equipment, facilities, skills, levels of personal health and the extent of support available to them from agencies outside the home. This suggests that there may be some information about the carers' situation, but not necessarily statistics related to age groups or percentages.\n\nI also noticed that one of the papers mentions the importance of training informal carers in skills they require, which could indicate that these individuals are actively involved in providing care. However, this does not provide specific data on the percentage of over 65s who are providing informal care.\n\nBased on this analysis, I will rely on external sources for information on statistics related to informal carers, as none of the provided documents contain such data.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
