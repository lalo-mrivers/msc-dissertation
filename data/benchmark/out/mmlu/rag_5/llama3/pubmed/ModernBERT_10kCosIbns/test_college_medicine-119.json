["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the composition of codons. Codons are a fundamental concept in molecular biology that refer to the sequences of nucleotide bases in DNA or mRNA. Based on my knowledge and the provided documents, which primarily discuss topics such as QSAR studies, absorption difference and comparative absorption spectrophotometry, and neutron diffraction data from carbonmonoxymyoglobin, I can confidently say that codons are composed of triplet sequences of nucleotide bases in mRNA or DNA.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
