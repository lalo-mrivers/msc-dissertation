["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks how mutations in DNA can result in the expression of a new phenotype. From the provided documents, we see that insertional mutation of 'classical' and novel genes can lead to mutants providing useful models of human inherited disorders and developmental abnormalities. This suggests that changes in the DNA sequence can indeed cause the expression of a new phenotype. The relevant document is 'Insertional mutation of 'classical' and novel genes in transgenic mice'.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
