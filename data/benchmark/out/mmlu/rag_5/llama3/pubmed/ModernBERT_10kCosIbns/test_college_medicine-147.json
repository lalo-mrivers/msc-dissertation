["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe glycogen breakdown during exhaustive exercise. Exercise-induced catabolic responses in various muscle fibres state that during exercise the most active muscle fibres do not contribute to the mobilization of protein resources, but rather, they store energy as glycogen. Regulation of muscle carbohydrate metabolism during exercise explains that muscle carbohydrate utilization is regulated primarily by two factors: delivery of substrate to the glycolytic pathway and formation of triosephosphate by phosphofructokinase. Muscle glycogen depletion patterns in fast twitch fibre subgroups of man during submaximal and supramaximal exercise indicate that glycogen was depleted the most in ST fibres, least in FTb fibres, and intermediate in FTa fibres. Non-exercising muscle metabolism during exercise shows that glycogen decrements were observed in non-exercising muscles during exercise. All these findings suggest that glycogen breakdown is not activated by insulin, cortisol or pH, but rather it's an energy-dependent process.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
