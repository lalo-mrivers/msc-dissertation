["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents mention pressure injuries. In the 'High pressure injection injury of the hand' document, there is no specific information about how long it takes for pressure damage to be visible after being on an operating table for four hours. However, in the 'The effectiveness of a pressure clinic in preventing pressure sores' document, we can see that interface pressures are routinely measured to ensure that appropriate cushioning is provided, and thermography is also used to ensure that the blood flow to the skin is not compromised.

The 'Surgical management of severe pelvic crush injuries' document doesn't provide specific information about pressure damage either.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
