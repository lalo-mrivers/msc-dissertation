["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks for an organism belonging to the nekton. Nekton refers to a group of aquatic animals that are capable of independent movement. This can be found by looking at the relevant documents provided. Since none of the documents provide information about the nekton, we will look at the documents' topics to see if any mention the nekton. The first document discusses nitrogen fixation in some isolates of Nostoc linckia, which is a type of algae. The second and fourth documents discuss genes related to neural development and mitochondrial DNA sequences, respectively. The third document talks about early neural development in Xenopus embryos. None of these topics mention the nekton. Therefore, we will have to look at our general knowledge to answer this question.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
