["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The reaction involves 2-bromobutane, which is a alkyl halide. In the presence of ethanol, an SN2 reaction occurs, resulting in the substitution of bromine with a hydroxyl group. This leads to the formation of 2-butene as the major product and 1-butene as the minor product. The key factor that determines why 2-butene is the major product is the nucleophile, ethanol, attacking the most stable carbon atom (carbon 2) in the alkyl halide.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
