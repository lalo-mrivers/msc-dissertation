["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question describes a sound wave emitted by a source with certain properties (velocity, intensity, frequency, and wavelength) in one medium. When the sound exits this medium and enters a denser medium, some of these properties might change. The question asks what property remains unchanged. We need to consider how each property changes when a sound wave transitions from one medium to another.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
