["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, we need to understand the anatomy of the neck. The relevant documents describe the position of the head depending on the function of the neck muscles. We also know that there are various vital structures in the neck, including great vessels and food and air passages. In terms of palpation, we can start from the chin and move upwards to the sternal notch. The hyoid bone is located at the level of the thyroid cartilage. The cricoid cartilage is located lower down, just above the trachea.
