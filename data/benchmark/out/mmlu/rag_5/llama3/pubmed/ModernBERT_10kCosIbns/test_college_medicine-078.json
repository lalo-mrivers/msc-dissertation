["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The scientist is stimulating a group of neurons in the hypothalamus. She observes a sharp rise in membrane potential when she first stimulates them (depolarization), with a difference of 100mV. When she tries another stimulation immediately after the first, there is no response. However, when she increases the amount of voltage she supplies to the second shock, she observes a similar response to the first. This suggests that the neurons are refractory and need time to recover from the initial depolarization. Therefore, the second shock would be characterized as low-frequency stimulation.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
