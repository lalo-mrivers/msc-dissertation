["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the mapping of human chromosomes. The documents provided discuss the status of the gene map of human chromosomes, developments in laboratory diagnosis of chromosomal abnormalities, and molecular cytogenetic study of short arm aberrations in human D, G group chromosomes. However, there is no direct evidence that suggests mapping of human chromosomes has been restricted to sex chromosomes because of small family sizes. Similarly, large numbers of DNA markers are not mentioned as a factor that contributed to the success of chromosome mapping. The question does not specifically ask about linkage groups or the involvement of DNA in coding for genes. Therefore, based on the provided information, it can be inferred that option C is incorrect, and options A and D are unlikely to be correct. Option B is a plausible answer because the development of laboratory techniques has made possible the detailed analysis of human chromosomes, leading to a better understanding of chromosome mapping.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
