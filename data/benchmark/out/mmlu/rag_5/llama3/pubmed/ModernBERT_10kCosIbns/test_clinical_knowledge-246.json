["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant document for this question is 'Insufficient dietary carbohydrate during training: does it impair athletic performance?' It states that scrutiny of the literature does not strongly support the hypothesis that short-term or long-term reductions in dietary carbohydrate energy impairs training or athletic performance. Additionally, there is no indication that a low intake of carbohydrates affects resting muscle pH. Therefore, options A and B can be eliminated. The document does suggest that a high carbohydrate diet may optimize training adaptations and performance, which implies that a low carbohydrate diet may impair high intensity exercise performance, supporting option C. Finally, the question about greater reliance on muscle glycogen during exercise is not directly addressed in the document, so option D cannot be confirmed or ruled out based on this information alone.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
