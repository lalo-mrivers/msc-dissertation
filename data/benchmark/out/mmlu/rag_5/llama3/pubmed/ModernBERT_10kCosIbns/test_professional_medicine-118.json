["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient underwent a radical thyroidectomy and had moderate hemorrhaging during the operation, which required ligation of several vessels on the left side of the neck. The postoperative serum studies show low calcium levels (7.5 mg/dL), which is consistent with hypocalcemia.
