["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the stages of mitosis. Prophase is one of the stages mentioned. According to the documents, during prophase, the nucleoli dissolve. There is no mention of nuclear membrane formation in this stage. Cytokinesis is when the cytoplasm and organelles separate, which doesn't match what's asked. Telophase involves the formation of an equatorial plate, but again, not related to nucleoli dissolution. Anaphase is when sister chromatids separate, but still not related to nucleoli. Therefore, Prophase - Dissolution of nucleoli matches.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
