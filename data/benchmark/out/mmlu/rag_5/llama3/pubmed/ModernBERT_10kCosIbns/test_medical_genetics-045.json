["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the normal range of maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein (MSAFP) levels throughout pregnancy. According to [Maternal plasma alpha-fetoprotein in normal and complicated pregnancies], a curve with the 90th percentile in normal pregnancy was established. Since lower than average means below the 5th centile, we look for information about situations where MSAFP levels are below this threshold. In [Clinical studies on maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein (MSAFP) of 532 cases--the median value, pregnancy outcomes and clinical evaluation], it is mentioned that 33 cases (6.2%) had low MSAFP (0.5 â‰¤ MOM). One possible cause of low MSAFP is twin pregnancies. Therefore, the correct answer is likely D: Twin pregnancies.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
