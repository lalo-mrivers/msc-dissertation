["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the percentage of variation in body mass index explained by known SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms) in genome-wide association studies. The evidence from twin and family studies suggests that heritability is greater than 50%, indicating a significant genetic component to BMI. However, the known SNPs do not account for the majority of this heritability, which suggests that there are many more genetic variants contributing to BMI that have not yet been identified or studied.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
