["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is complaining of chronic pelvic pain after undergoing a hysterectomy 6 months ago. A CT scan was ordered to investigate the cause of the pain, which revealed a surgical sponge left in her pelvis. This suggests that the sponge must have been left behind during the original surgery and not as a result of any subsequent event.

The legal concept that applies in this case is that the sponge could not have been left unless there was negligence.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
