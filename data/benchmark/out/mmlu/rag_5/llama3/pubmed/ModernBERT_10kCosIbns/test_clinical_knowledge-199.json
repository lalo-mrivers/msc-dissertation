["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"There is no information provided about the fibers mentioned (e.g. chymotrypsin, trypsin, nylon, polyester) that would directly relate to fast-twitch fibers. Therefore, we must look for information on muscle fibers and their characteristics. In the relevant documents, there is a mention of protein fibers (casein and vegetable proteins), which are spun into solutions and can be affected by chemicals and physical forces (e.g., deformation). Fast-twitch fibers are a type of skeletal muscle fiber. Based on this information, we must look for general knowledge about fast-twitch fibers to make an educated guess.\", \"answer_choice\": D}"]
