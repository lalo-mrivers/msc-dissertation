["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"During the mammalian cardiac cycle, blood is transferred from the more compliant venous side to the less compliant arterial side. This process involves changes in pressure between these two compartments. The relevant document for this question is 'Aspects of cardiac venous flow measured by the continuous infusion thermodilution technique'. According to this document, submaximal atrial pacing led to a significant increase in flow in all veins. The mean increase in flow per heart beat was 1.41 ml in the coronary sinus (CS), 0.93 ml in the great cardiac vein (GCV), and 0.58 ml in other veins (OV). This means that there is an increase in blood transfer from the venous side to the arterial side, which would lead to an increase in arterial pressure.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: little effect on venous pressure and a large increase in arterial pressure\""]
