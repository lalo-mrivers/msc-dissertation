["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about autozygosity mapping, which is a technique used to map disorders that show a specific pattern of inheritance. Based on the provided documents, none of them directly relate to autozygosity mapping or the pattern of inheritance mentioned in the question. However, one of the documents discusses a two-locus model for the inheritance of a familial disease, which involves the interaction between genes at just two linked loci. This could be related to the concept of autozygosity mapping, but it is not directly applicable to this specific question.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe key to solving this problem lies in understanding that autozygosity mapping is used to map disorders that show autosomal recessive inheritance. This type of inheritance is characterized by a pattern where the disorder only appears when an individual inherits two copies of the mutated gene, one from each parent (homozygous state).\\r\\n\\r\\nIn contrast, dominant inheritance occurs when an individual inherits just one copy of the mutated gene and still expresses the disorder.\\r\\n\\r\\nBased on this understanding, we can infer that autozygosity mapping is used to map disorders that show autosomal recessive inheritance.\", \"answer_choice\": B}"]
