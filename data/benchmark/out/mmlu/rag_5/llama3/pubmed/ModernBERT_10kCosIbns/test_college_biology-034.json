["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The given DNA strand has the sequence 5' CGA TTG 3'. To find its complementary sequence, we need to consider the base pairing rules between A/T and G/C. According to these rules, a C in one strand is paired with a G in the other, an A in one strand is paired with a T in the other, and so on. Therefore, the complementary sequence would be one where Cs are replaced by Gs, As are replaced by Ts, and vice versa.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
