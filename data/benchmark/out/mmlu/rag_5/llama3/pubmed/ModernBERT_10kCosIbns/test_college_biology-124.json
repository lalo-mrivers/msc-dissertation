["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about a fixed action pattern. A fixed action pattern is a type of behavior that is characterized by a stereotyped sequence of movements that are performed in response to a specific stimulus. The documents provided describe different types of behavioral patterns, such as movement sequences, inhibition, and spatial orientation. However, they do not specifically mention a fixed action pattern. Therefore, the answer must be found in one of the given options. Options A and D seem unrelated to the concept of a fixed action pattern. Option B mentions sensory feedback, which is an important aspect of a fixed action pattern. Option C describes a motor response that can be terminated spontaneously, which is also consistent with the definition of a fixed action pattern. Therefore, the correct answer is likely either B or C.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
