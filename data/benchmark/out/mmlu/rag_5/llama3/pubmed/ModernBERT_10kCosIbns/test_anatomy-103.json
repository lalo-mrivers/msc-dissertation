["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about which bones develop by endochondral ossification. We need to look for relevant information on the process of endochondral ossification from the provided documents. Endochondral ossification is described in [Osteon structure of the enchondral layer of labyrinthine bone. A comparative anatomical study]. The document states that the endochondral layer consists of woven, alamellar, fine-fibred type of bone which is called \\\"embryonic skein bone\\\" (embryonaler Str√§hnenknochen). This suggests that bones formed through endochondral ossification have a specific structure. We also need to consider other documents related to the formation of bone centers and the construction of skeletal organs, as they might provide insights into the development of certain bones.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D: The ribs, sternum, clavicle and vertebrae\"}"]
