["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the benefits that mycorrhizal fungi confer to many plants. From the provided documents, we can infer that mycorrhizal fungi are involved in nutrient absorption and may play a role in nitrogen fixation. However, the document 'Study of nitrogenase activity...' suggests that mycorrhiza did not play any role in stimulating the nitrogen fixing system. Instead, it was mentioned that phosphate is accumulated in particularly large quantities as polyphosphate, which probably explains the linear relations of phosphate absorption and oxygen uptake in certain conditions. Therefore, one of the benefits that mycorrhizal fungi confer to many plants is the provision of access to phosphorus.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
