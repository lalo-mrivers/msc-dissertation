["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the abnormality associated with a palpable left parasternal impulse. The relevant information comes from the 'Origin of ventricular reflexes caused by coronary arteriography' document. According to this document, the degree of bradycardia was not influenced by the origin of the sinus node or the AV node arteries, while there was a good correlation with the injection into the artery which supplied the inferior wall of the left ventricle. This suggests that the parasympathetic receptors are located mainly in the inferior wall of the left ventricle. A palpable left parasternal impulse is likely to be indicative of hypertrophy of this ventricle.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
