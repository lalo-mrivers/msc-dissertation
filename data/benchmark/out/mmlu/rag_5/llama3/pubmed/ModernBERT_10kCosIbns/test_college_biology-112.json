["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The optimality theory is often advanced as an axiom that natural selection tends ideally to maximize inclusive fitness of the individual or some other suitable quantity. The concept of 'fitness' is a consequence of the adaptedness of an entity to its environment, and it is manifested as persistence of those attributes. Adaptationist programmes have dominated evolutionary thought, but they may not consider adequately competing themes such as random fixation of alleles, production of non-adaptive structures by developmental correlation with selected features, or current utility as an epiphenomenon of non-adaptive structures.\n\nThe idea that beneficial traits are always worth the cost to the organism in energy and physiology is a simplification, as there may be trade-offs among competing selective demands that exert brakes upon perfection. The optimality theory should consider these complexities and nuances.\n\nMoreover, frequency-dependent selection may not lead to a 'simple optimum' at the end of the selective process, since all individuals may not have the same strategy and the mean fitness of the population may not be maximized. Therefore, the optimality theory should take into account these complexities as well.\n\nIn conclusion, the optimality theory as applied to a given trait is best represented by the idea that beneficial traits are not always worth the cost to the organism in energy and physiology, and that there may be trade-offs among competing selective demands that exert brakes upon perfection.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
