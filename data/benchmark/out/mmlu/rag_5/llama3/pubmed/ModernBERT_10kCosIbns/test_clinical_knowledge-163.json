["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about mutations, which are errors in DNA. According to the provided documents, mutations can occur spontaneously at a low rate (Mechanism and kinetics of repair mutagenesis). Additionally, it is mentioned that environmental agents may cause mutations in humans, but this does not necessarily imply that all mutations occur only in the presence of carcinogens. Mutations do not always have to be harmful, as the presence of genetic controls can influence the outcome. Therefore, option D appears to be the most accurate representation of spontaneous mutation occurrence.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
