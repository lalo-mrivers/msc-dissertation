["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks how lactate and hydrogen ions leave the muscle. From the provided documents, we can see that hydrogen ions have a much faster efflux rate than lactate ions. This is evident from the study 'Comparison of efflux rates of hydrogen and lactate ions from isolated muscles in vitro.' The difference in efflux kinetics suggests that the methods for removing these substances are different.\n\nThe study 'Metabolic intermediates and lactate diffusion in active dog skeletal muscle' also shows that during contractions, there is an increase in lactate release (La), but this is not associated with hypoxia. Instead, blood flow (Q) has a major influence on La.\n\nThese studies suggest that hydrogen ions may leave the muscle via simple diffusion, as their efflux rate is much faster than lactate ions. Lactate, on the other hand, may require an active transport mechanism or be transported through a protein transporter molecule, given its slower efflux rate and association with metabolic activity.\n\nTherefore, based on these findings, it can be inferred that hydrogen ions primarily leave the muscle via simple diffusion.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
