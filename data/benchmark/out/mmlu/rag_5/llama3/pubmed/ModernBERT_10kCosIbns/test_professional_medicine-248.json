["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 72-year-old woman who has smoked 20 cigarettes daily for the past 38 years. She begins using eyedrops for glaucoma and develops shortness of breath three days later while walking up a flight of stairs. The eyedrops are likely to contain apraclonidine, timolol, or latanoprost as they are commonly used to treat glaucoma. Apraclonidine is unlikely to cause shortness of breath, whereas timolol and latanoprost are both beta blockers that can cause respiratory depression leading to shortness of breath. Epinephrine is not a typical ingredient in eyedrops for glaucoma and would not be expected to cause shortness of breath in this patient.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
