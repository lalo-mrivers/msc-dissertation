["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has a 6-day history of fever, severe muscle pain, and diffuse, painful swelling of his neck, underarms, and groin area. The symptoms began after returning from a camping trip in New Mexico. He appears ill and lethargic and can barely answer questions. His physical examination shows generalized scattered black maculae and an erythematous, solid, tender mass on the underside of the upper extremity just above the elbow; the mass is draining blood and necrotic material. This suggests a severe bacterial infection, possibly due to gram-negative bacteria such as Klebsiella or Proteus spp., which are common causes of septicemia in tropical regions. The patient's symptoms are consistent with sepsis syndrome, characterized by hypotension, tachycardia, and disseminated intravascular coagulation. Therefore, the most effective antibiotic for this patient's disorder will likely target these types of bacteria.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B\n}"]
