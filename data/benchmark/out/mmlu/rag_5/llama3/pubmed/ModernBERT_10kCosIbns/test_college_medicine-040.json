["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the teacher's observation of her students' behavior. The teacher noticed that performance on quizzes has increased significantly but tardiness has only decreased slightly. This suggests that the reward system was more effective in improving academic performance than it was in reducing tardiness. This could be due to the fact that the reward for good grades (getting above a 90% on three quizzes) is contingent upon specific academic behavior, whereas the reward for being on time is not. Therefore, the students may have been more motivated to improve their grades because they were reinforced for doing so. In contrast, tardiness may be a more automatic behavior that is less susceptible to change through rewards alone.\", \"answer_choice\": B}"]
