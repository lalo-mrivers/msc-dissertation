["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking which ultrasound finding would NOT raise suspicion of a chromosome abnormality. According to the provided documents, specific anatomical fetal malformations identified by ultrasound increase the risk for fetal chromosome abnormalities. Risks of abnormal chromosomes in the fetus are present with both single and multiple anomalies including amniotic fluid volume although the risk is increased with specific anatomical systems and multiple malformations. Duodenal atresia, holoprosencephaly, congenital heart disease, diaphragmatic hernia, and omphalocele were mentioned as specific multiple ultrasound anomalies with abnormal amniotic fluid volume. Hydrops fetalis was also mentioned as a single anomaly associated with an increased risk of chromosomal abnormalities. Monozygotic twins are not typically associated with chromosome abnormalities. Therefore, the finding that would NOT raise suspicion of a chromosome abnormality is D: Monozygotic twins.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
