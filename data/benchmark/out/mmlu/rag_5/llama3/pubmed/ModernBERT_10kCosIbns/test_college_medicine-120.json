["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents suggest that high intensity running can be used for making comparisons in soccer. The measurement of lactate is a major aid for controlling the capacity of an athlete and for establishing individual training schedules. Additionally, the site of blood sampling or the distribution of lactate in the blood affects the results. The study found a significant correlation (r = 0.61, p less than 0.05) between the amount of high intensity running during the match and lactate concentration in the blood. This implies that the blood lactate concentration will increase as the players become more fatigued throughout the game.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
