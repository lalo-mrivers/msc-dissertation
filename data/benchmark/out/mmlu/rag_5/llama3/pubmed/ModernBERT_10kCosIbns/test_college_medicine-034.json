["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, we can see that human body responses to thermal environment include physiological autonomic responses. In hot environments, peripheral vasodilation increases thermal conductance and sweat secretion for evaporative cooling. This indicates that the body compensates for increased environmental temperature by increasing thermal conductance and heat loss through evaporation.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
