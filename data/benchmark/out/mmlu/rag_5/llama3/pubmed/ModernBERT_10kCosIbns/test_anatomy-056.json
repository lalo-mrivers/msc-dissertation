["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The document mentions that the PO afferent fibres have separate representations in the brainstem--in trigeminal sensory nucleus principalis (Vp) and rostral subnucleus oralis (Vo), in trigeminal subnucleus interpolaris (Vi), and in caudal trigeminal subnucleus caudalis (Vc) and C1 dorsal horn. The infraorbital nerve section at different ages shows that PO afferent fibres have three separate representations in the brainstem. There is no direct information about the infraorbital nerve, but it can be inferred from other studies.\",\n\"answer_choice\": A"]
