["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided, it is clear that this patient has recurrent low back pain. The fact that the pain recurs every 2-3 months suggests a chronic condition rather than an acute one. Given the patient's history of gestational diabetes and current BMI of 37 kg/m2, there may be an underlying metabolic or systemic issue contributing to her symptoms. The physical examination reveals no abnormalities, which further suggests that the cause of her pain is not likely to be mechanical in nature. Therefore, ordering imaging studies (x-rays or MRI) may not be the most appropriate next step. Similarly, administering an epidural injection of methylprednisolone without a clear underlying diagnosis would be premature.
