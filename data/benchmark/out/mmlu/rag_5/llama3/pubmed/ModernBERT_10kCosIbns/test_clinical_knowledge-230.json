["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about alterations in neurotransmitters that influence fatigue development. The relevant documents mention CRH (corticotropin-releasing hormone) and its possible deficiency in chronic fatigue syndrome patients. This suggests a connection between CRH and fatigue. However, the provided options do not include CRH, so we need to focus on the other neurotransmitter combinations mentioned in the documents. Acetyl choline is mentioned in [Interorgan metabolic correlations during muscular activity and fatigue]., but there's no clear connection to fatigue development. Noradrenaline is also not explicitly linked to fatigue. Dopamine is mentioned in [Effect of sodium oxybutyrate, phenamin, transamine and L-dopa on the processes of work capacity recovery under conditions of minimal rest], as well as in the other documents, but there's no clear evidence that it directly influences fatigue development. Serotonin is not explicitly linked to fatigue either. Glutamate is only mentioned as a general neurotransmitter involved in various processes. Considering all this information, we can eliminate options A and C. Option B mentions dopamine and acetyl choline, which are both indirectly linked to fatigue through their involvement in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. Option D mentions dopamine and serotonin, which have no clear connection to fatigue development.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
