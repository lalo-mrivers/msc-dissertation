["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question describes an enzyme that participates in synthesis of an unknown product using two reactants. The reaction involves switching a nitrogen group from one reactant to the other. Based on this information, we can infer that the enzyme is involved in a process that modifies or transfers a group between molecules. This is consistent with the definition of transferase enzymes, which catalyze reactions that involve the transfer of a chemical group from one molecule to another.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
