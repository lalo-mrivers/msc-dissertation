["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents discuss variations in bronchial movement, respiratory function tests, breathlessness in patients with chronic airflow limitation, bronchoconstriction induced by repeated forced vital capacity manoeuvres, and the beneficial effect of nasal breathing on exercise-induced bronchoconstriction. None of these texts directly discuss bronchial breathing or its characteristics. However, they do provide information about bronchial movement, respiratory function tests, and airway responses to different stimuli. Therefore, it is necessary to look for indirect clues about bronchial breathing. The closest text that can be used as a clue is the one discussing variations in bronchial movement. It states that during full inspiration, bronchial walls may be completely extended and appear normal, but on radiographs taken on expiration, weakness of the bronchial wall may be revealed which otherwise would be missed.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
