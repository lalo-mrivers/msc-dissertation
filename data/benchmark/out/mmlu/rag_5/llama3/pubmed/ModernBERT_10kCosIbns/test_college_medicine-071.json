["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents discuss the physiological responses to different types of exercise, including maximal dynamic exercise. In 'Physiological responses to maximal intensity intermittent exercise', it is stated that the oxygen uptake was measured immediately after the last sprint in each protocol. This suggests that the measurement was taken shortly after the exercise ended, but does not specify exactly how long after the exercise ended the measurement was taken. Therefore, we cannot determine from this document when maximal dynamic exercise becomes predominantly aerobic.\n\nIn 'Hormonal and metabolic responses to exercise in subjects of high and low work capacities', it is stated that eight normal subjects exercised for 20 minutes at 750 kpm/min on a cycle ergometer, which represented 35% and 85% of the maximal oxygen uptake for the fit and unfit subjects respectively. This suggests that the exercise was prolonged aerobic exercise rather than maximal dynamic exercise.\n\nIn 'Depressed systolic and diastolic cardiac function after prolonged aerobic exercise in healthy subjects', it is stated that 11 healthy untrained volunteers (aged 28.9 +/- 4.6 years) during 60 minutes of aerobic ergometric exercise with constant heart rates of 130 to 140 beats/minute. This suggests that the exercise was prolonged aerobic exercise rather than maximal dynamic exercise.\n\nIn 'Quantification of exercise capability and evaluation of physical capacity in man', it is stated that a multi-stage exercise test on a treadmill or bicycle ergometer will provide a measurement of the rate of work an individual is able to tolerate without symptoms or electro-cardiographic abnormalities. This suggests that the exercise was prolonged aerobic exercise rather than maximal dynamic exercise.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided in these documents, we cannot determine when maximal dynamic exercise becomes predominantly aerobic.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
