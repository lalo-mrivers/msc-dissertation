["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about excretory organs. The passage about 'Excretion in insects: function of gut and rectum in concentrating and diluting the urine' provides information about insect excretory systems. Insects have a different type of excretory system than mammals, with Malpighian tubules secreting a fluid that is unlike blood composition. This information can be used to eliminate options A and D as they relate to mammalian kidneys.\n\nThe passage also mentions the rectum in insects being involved in concentrating and diluting urine, which allows for selective reabsorption of electrolytes. This information can help eliminate option B as desert mammals would not produce hypoosmotic urine compared to freshwater fishes.\n\nOption C is true according to the passage about 'Excretion in insects: function of gut and rectum in concentrating and diluting the urine'. Malpighian tubules do allow insects to excrete waste through the exoskeleton.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"]
