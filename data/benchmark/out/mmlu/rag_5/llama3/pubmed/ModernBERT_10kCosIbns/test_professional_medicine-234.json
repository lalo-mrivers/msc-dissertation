["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the properties of a killed vaccine relative to a live vaccine. We need to look for the characteristics that make a killed vaccine suitable for this newly identified virus. The relevant documents mention that vaccines can be produced using different approaches, including attenuation or inactivation. Killed vaccines are inactivated whole organisms, whereas live vaccines use attenuated agents. Since the question mentions a new severe respiratory illness caused by a newly identified virus, we should focus on the properties of killed vaccines.\n\nThe documents highlight the advantages of live attenuated viruses in achieving long-lasting immunity after one or two administrations. However, for this newly identified virus, we are looking for a rationale to develop a killed vaccine. The relevant document on 'Strategies for exploiting the immune system in the design of vaccines' mentions that a vaccine needs to achieve four goals: activation of antigen-presenting cells, overcoming genetic variability in T cell responses, generation of high levels of T and B memory cells, and persistence of antigen for recruitment of B memory cells. Killed vaccines may be more suitable for this newly identified virus because they can provide the necessary antigens for the immune system to respond effectively.\n\nIn comparison, live vaccines have their own advantages, such as inducing long-lasting immunity after one or two administrations. However, the question asks about the most appropriate rationale for developing a killed vaccine, which means we should focus on the properties that make a killed vaccine suitable for this newly identified virus. The concern about reversion to virulence is not directly related to the choice between killed and live vaccines.\n\nThe other options do not provide a clear rationale for developing a killed vaccine for this illness. Developing rapid protective immunity or lifelong immunity may be achieved through different approaches, such as using attenuated agents in live vaccines. Generating mucosal immunity can be achieved through various mechanisms, including the use of mucosal adjuvants or oral vaccines.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate rationale for developing a killed vaccine for this newly identified virus is to avoid the concern for reversion to virulence.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
