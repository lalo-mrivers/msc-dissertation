["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the question, we know that the neonate was born at 36 weeks' gestation via cesarean delivery due to fetal heart rate decelerations. The amniotic fluid was stained with light particulate meconium, and the infant's vital signs show mild subcostal and intercostal retractions. Chest x-ray shows prominent pulmonary vascular markings and fluid in the intralobar fissures. Considering these findings, we can rule out Group B streptococcal sepsis (A) as the most likely diagnosis since there is no mention of a positive blood culture or signs of systemic infection.\n\nThe presence of meconium-stained amniotic fluid (B) and the patient's physical examination findings are consistent with meconium aspiration syndrome, which is a possible diagnosis. However, we should also consider respiratory distress syndrome (C) given that the infant was born via cesarean delivery and has signs of mild respiratory difficulty.\n\nTransient tachypnea of newborn (D) is less likely given the presence of meconium-stained amniotic fluid and the patient's physical examination findings.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the most likely diagnosis is meconium aspiration syndrome (B).\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
