["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the development of the bones of the viscerocranium. After reviewing the provided documents, I found that [Osteosynthesis and plastic surgery of the visceral cranium] mentions that the skull is restored with due consideration for anatomical function and cosmetic factors. This suggests that the viscerocranium develops in relation to overall cranial development. The document [A critical analysis of the growth in length of the cranial base] discusses the basicranium chondrifies and ossifies in a posteroanterior sequence, but ceases growth in an anteroposterior sequence. This indicates that the viscerocranium grows and develops in relation to the overall cranial base.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C\n}"]
