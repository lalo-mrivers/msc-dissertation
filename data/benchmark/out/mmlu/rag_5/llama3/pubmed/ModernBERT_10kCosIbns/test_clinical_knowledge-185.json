["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks how many chromosomes human somatic cells contain. We can look at the last document which talks about the use of human repetitive DNA to target selectable markers into only the human chromosome of a human-hamster hybrid cell line (AL). It mentions that the sole human chromosome, number 11, has been targeted. This suggests that there is more than one human chromosome in these cells. Looking at the 'status of the gene map of the human chromosomes' document, we see that it talks about the specific chromosome that carries each of about 210 gene loci. This implies that there are many more than just one or two human chromosomes. Finally, looking at the 'De novo chromosome formation in rodent cells' document, we see that a hybrid cell line was produced by the fusion of an EC3/7 mouse cell with a Chinese hamster ovary cell. The fact that the marker centromere separated from the dicentric chromosome and formed a full-sized chromosome suggests that there are multiple human chromosomes.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D\n}"]
