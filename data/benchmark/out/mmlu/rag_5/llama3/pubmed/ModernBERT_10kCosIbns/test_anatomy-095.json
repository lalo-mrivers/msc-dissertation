["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents suggest that the phrenic nerves are involved in innervation of the heart (document 2), which is also supported by the fact that the division of the phrenic nerves in dogs leads to disorders of the rhythm, abnormalities in the electrocardiogram, and degenerative changes in the intramural nerve apparatus of the heart. Additionally, electrical stimulation of the phrenic nerve gives rise to early potentials in the contralateral sensory-motor cortex of cats (document 4). Given these findings, it is likely that the phrenic nerves play a role in controlling the diaphragm's function.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
