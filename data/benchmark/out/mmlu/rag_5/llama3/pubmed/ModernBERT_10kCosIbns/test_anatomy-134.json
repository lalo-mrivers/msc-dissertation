["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about which structures should be visible on a dental panoramic radiograph. The documents provide information about the uses of panoramic radiography and the types of images that can be obtained from this type of imaging. From the documents, we can determine that panoramic radiographs have inherent distortions in size, but these distortions can assist clinicians in determining the site of impacted teeth. Additionally, panoramic radiographs are used to view internal structures for diagnosis of caries, periapical lesions, and periodontal disease. This information suggests that panoramic radiographs provide a broad overview of the entire mastication organ and neighboring structures, including the maxillary sinus and hard palate.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
