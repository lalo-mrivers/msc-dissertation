["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the differential distribution of substances in the egg. The provided documents are about bacterial contamination of hen's eggs, factors necessary for normal morphogenetic function of anuran endoderm, characterization of poultry egg production, influence of hormonal extracts on hens producing eggs with non-calcified or partially calcified shells, and gas exchange of the fertile hen's egg. There is no direct evidence from these documents to support any of the answer choices A-D. Therefore, we cannot conclude that differential distribution of substances in the egg most typically results in differences in gene expression which may establish a pattern in the embryo as the cells divide (A), amplification of specific genes during development (B), development of polyploid tissues (C), or loss of specific genes during development (D).\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"None\"\n}"]
