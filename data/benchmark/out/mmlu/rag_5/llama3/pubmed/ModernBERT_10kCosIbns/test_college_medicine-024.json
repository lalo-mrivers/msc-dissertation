["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about what is embedded in the inner membrane of the mitochondrion. The relevant documents mention that the mitochondrial genome is simple yet complex, and it highlights recent advances in our understanding of mitochondrial gene organization and expression. It also talks about the binding of DNA of nonmitochondrial origin by the membrane structures of the mitochondria. This suggests that there are components or particles on the inner membrane that can bind to DNA. Further reading reveals that these particles are called 'elementary particles of transcription' which contain specific centers for binding to DNA.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
