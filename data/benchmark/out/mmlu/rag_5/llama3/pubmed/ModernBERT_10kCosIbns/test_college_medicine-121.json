["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the provided documents, it can be seen that neurons play a crucial role in the central nervous system. The concept of neuronal types is studied by classifying similar neurons across different brains. Recent studies have revealed that the central nervous system is surprisingly plastic, allowing for remarkable responses from remaining neurons under specific conditions. This plasticity is achieved through the action of neurotransmitters and synaptic connections.\n\nConsidering the function of neurons, we can infer that they are capable of transmitting signals through action potentials, which involve changes in membrane potential. The flow of sodium into the neuron depolarizes the membrane during an action potential (option B).\n\nHyperpolarization at the end of an action potential is a mechanism by which neurons limit their firing rate (option A), but this does not preclude the possibility of subsequent action potentials.\n\nThe transmitting neuron secretes neurotransmitters from its terminal, not dendrites (option C). The axon hillock reaches threshold potential, initiating an action potential (option D).\n\nGiven these points, it appears that the correct option is...\",\n\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
