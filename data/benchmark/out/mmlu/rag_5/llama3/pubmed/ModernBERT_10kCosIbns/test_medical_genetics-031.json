["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Assuming Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, we can calculate the genotype frequency of heterozygotes by using the formula: p^2 + 2pq + q^2, where p and q are the frequencies of the two alleles. Given that the frequency of the two alleles are 0.6 and 0.4, we can plug in these values into the formula to get: (0.6)^2 + 2(0.6)(0.4) + (0.4)^2 = 0.36 + 0.48 + 0.16 = 0.96. Since the genotype frequency of heterozygotes is half of this value, it will be: 0.96/2 = 0.48.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
