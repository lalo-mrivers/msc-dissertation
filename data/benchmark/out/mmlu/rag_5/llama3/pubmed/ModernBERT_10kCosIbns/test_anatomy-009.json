["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the provided documents, we can see that the primary motor cortex is responsible for controlling movement. Specifically, the studies on somatotopic mapping of the primary motor cortex in humans (document 2) and invasive recording of movement-related cortical potentials in humans (document 4) both demonstrate that this region is involved in controlling voluntary movements.\n\nDocument 1 describes the organization of the motor region of the cerebral cortex, including the concept of neuronal assemblies. These assemblies are distributed along radiate fibres and radial vessels, do not form regularly alternated rows, and each assembly has a central axis perpendicular to the tangent line drawn on the cortical surface.\n\nGiven this information, it's clear that the primary motor cortex is responsible for controlling movement. Since the documents don't specifically mention which limb muscles are involved in this process, we can look at document 3, which discusses the mechanisms of participation of the sensomotor cortex in controlling movements. This study suggests that specific lemniscal signals concerning the movements filter inflow of teleceptive information to the neuronal modules and determine exact torographical relations of cortical motor outputs.\n\nTaking all of these factors into account, we can conclude that primary motor cortex activity results in contraction of contralateral limb musculature.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
