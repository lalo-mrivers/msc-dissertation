["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the mechanism that eventually suppresses the release of cortisol after a stress response. The relevant information can be found in [Participation of the hypothalamus in regulation of the pituitary-adrenal system in accordance with the feedback principle] and [Dynamics and mechanics of corticosteroid feedback at the hypothalamus and anterior pituitary gland]. According to these documents, cortisol inhibits the release of CRF from the hypothalamus, which is a negative feedback loop. This means that once cortisol levels rise after a stress response, it eventually suppresses its own release by inhibiting the release of CRF.\", \"answer_choice\": C}"]
