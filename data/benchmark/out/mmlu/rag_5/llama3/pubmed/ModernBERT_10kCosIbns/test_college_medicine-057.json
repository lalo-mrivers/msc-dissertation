["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The molecule binds to cytochrome oxidase A3, which is the final enzyme in the electron transport chain. This means that oxygen reduction is blocked, leading to a blockage of aerobic respiration. As a result, cells would not be able to pass electrons to oxygen, and aerobic metabolism would cease. This would lead to an inability for cells to produce ATP through oxidative phosphorylation, potentially causing cell death.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
