["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about Selective Androgen Receptor Modulators (SARMs). Based on the provided documents, it can be inferred that SARMs are compounds that interact with androgen receptors. The first document discusses the binding of androgens to specific macromolecules in the brain, which suggests that there may be multiple ways for androgens to bind to these receptors. The second document uses a CoMFA technique to study the binding of progestins and androgens to their respective receptors, suggesting differences in receptor selectivity between these hormones. The third document discusses the activation of specific genes by androgens, but not glucocorticoids or progestins, which implies that there may be distinct mechanisms for each hormone's action. Finally, the fourth document suggests that a single androgen receptor is unlikely to account for all effects induced by androgens.\n\nConsidering these points, it seems likely that SARMs could mimic the effects of natural steroid hormones (option A) or inhibit them (option D). However, based on the documents, there is no direct evidence to support the antagonistic effect of SARMs (option B), as this would require a receptor antagonist rather than a modulator.\n\nTherefore, the most logical answer choice would be option C: non-steroid drugs that act on androgen receptors mimicking the effects of natural steroid hormones.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
