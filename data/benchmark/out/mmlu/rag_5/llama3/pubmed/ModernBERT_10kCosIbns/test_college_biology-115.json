["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about a competitive inhibitor of an enzyme. A competitive inhibitor competes with the substrate molecule for the same enzyme's binding site. The documents describe enzymes' interactions with substrates and inhibitors, including transition-state theory and conformational rigid substrate. This suggests that the answer lies in the comparison between substrate and inhibitor. According to the first document, it is predicted that the substrates which resemble the natural species in structure of functional groups but possess conformational flexibility will be bound more tightly and converted slowly than the natural substrate. The similarity with inhibitors is apparent.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C\n}"]
