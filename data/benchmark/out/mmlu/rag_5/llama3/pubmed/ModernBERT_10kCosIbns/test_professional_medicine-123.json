["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 17-year-old boy who was found with a 'blank stare' and flat facial expression at a party. He then became catatonic, showing rigidity during the examination. Later on, he became hostile and attempted to assault the physician. This suggests that the patient may have ingested a drug that caused an acute reaction. The patient's physical exam shows normal vital signs, including pulse and blood pressure. However, his behavior changes suggest that the problem is not just physiological but also psychological.\n\nConsidering the symptoms and behaviors described, it seems that the patient may have ingested a dissociative anesthetic, which can cause catatonia, rigidity, and hostility.\n\nThe text [Drug use leading to death (author's transl)] discusses the sudden deaths of juveniles due to drug use. It mentions the possibility of indirect connection between drug use and the juvenile's death through accidents or suicidal actions. However, this information does not directly relate to the patient's condition.\n\n[Drug abuse and suicidal tendencies] discusses the suicidal development in juvenile drug consumers with polytoxicomanic drug-anamnesis. While it provides some insight into the psychological effects of drugs on adolescents, it is not directly relevant to the patient's condition either.\n\nThe text [Identification, assessment, and referral of adolescent drug abusers] does not provide any information that would help in identifying the ingested drug or its symptoms.\n\nHowever, the text 'Medical treatment of the adolescent drug abuser' discusses the pharmacologic properties of abused substances and their methods of administration. It also mentions the pediatrician's role in diagnosis and treatment of substance abuse, including recognizing stigmata in newborns of prenatally ingested drugs as well as treating neonatal drug withdrawal syndromes.\n\nIn this case, considering the patient's symptoms, behavior, and history, I think that PCP (phencyclidine) is the most likely ingested drug.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: PCP (phencyclidine)\""]
