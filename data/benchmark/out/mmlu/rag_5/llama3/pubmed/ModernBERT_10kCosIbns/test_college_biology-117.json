["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks for the best explanation why net primary productivity in terrestrial ecosystems tends to increase toward the tropics. A closer look at the provided documents reveals that none of them directly address this topic. However, we can infer some insights from the document 'Geographical dimensions of terrestrial net and gross primary productivity'. The paper discusses a model predicting net primary productivity from temperature and precipitation averages. This suggests that factors such as temperature and water availability might play a role in explaining the trend.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
