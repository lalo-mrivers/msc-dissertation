["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The manipulation of the first cleavage plane involves separating two blastomeres. The gray crescent is a structure containing the maternal chromosomes that play a crucial role in determining the developmental fate of the embryo. Since only one blastomere contains the gray crescent, it is likely that this blastomere will inherit the developmental potential and continue to divide and grow. In contrast, the other blastomere without the gray crescent may not have the necessary genetic information to support further development.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
