["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The passage mentions the study of mouse cellsurface proteins and human cell-surface proteins integrating along a fused mouse-human cell plasma membrane. This suggests that two different cell types were brought together to study their surface proteins. Therefore, it is likely that the technique employed was either producing a heterokaryon or producing a hybrid cell. However, the passage does not provide any information about the process of fusion, which favors the possibility of a heterokaryon.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
