["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks which statement is not true. The statements provided are related to glycogen breakdown, muscle fibers, liver function, and insulin's role. To determine the correct answer, I need to evaluate each statement individually.\n\nStatement A: Muscle glycogen is broken down enzymatically to glucose-1-phosphate - This is a true statement as muscle glycogen is indeed broken down into glucose-1-phosphate through the action of enzymes such as glycogen phosphorylase and debranching enzyme.\n\nStatement B: Elite endurance runners have a high proportion of Type I fibres in their leg muscles - This is also a true statement, as elite endurance runners tend to have a higher percentage of slow-twitch (Type I) muscle fibers in their leg muscles, which are better suited for long-distance running.\n\nStatement C: Liver glycogen is important in the maintenance of the blood glucose concentration - This is another true statement, as the liver plays a crucial role in regulating blood glucose levels by storing and releasing glucose from glycogen stores.\n\nStatement D: Insulin promotes glucose uptake by all tissues in the body - However, this is not entirely accurate. While insulin does promote glucose uptake in many tissues, it does not do so in all tissues. Some tissues, such as the brain, are relatively insensitive to insulin's effects on glucose uptake.\n\nBased on these evaluations, Statement D appears to be the one that is not true.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
