["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents suggest that the ATP store in muscle is depleted rapidly during near maximal intense exercise. According to the document 'Skeletal muscle energy metabolism and fatigue during intense exercise in man', the muscle store of ATP will be depleted in < 1s, which means it can only supply energy for a very short period. This information is supported by another document 'ATP and phosphocreatine changes in single human muscle fibers after intense electrical stimulation' which shows that ATP levels decrease rapidly during exercise.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
