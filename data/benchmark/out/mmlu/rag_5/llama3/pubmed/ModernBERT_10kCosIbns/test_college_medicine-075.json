["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about Selective Androgen Receptor Modulators (SARMs). From the provided documents, it can be seen that SARMs are likely to be non-steroid drugs that act on androgen receptors. This is because the documents mention a receptor mechanism that detects relative concentrations of androgens and estrogens, which suggests that there may be multiple ways to interact with these receptors. Additionally, the document discussing progestin and androgen receptor binding using the CoMFA technique mentions differences in sterics and electrostatics correlating to binding affinity between androgen and progesterone receptors, which further supports the idea of non-steroid drugs acting on androgen receptors.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
