["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Enzymes are effective in facilitating chemical reactions because they lower the activation energy, thereby speeding up the conversion of reactants to products. This is evident from the documents, particularly [Evolutionary optimization of the catalytic efficiency of enzymes]. The optimal kinetic design of the reaction mechanism involves equal magnitude of forward and reverse rate constants, which suggests that the enzyme operates in a way that reduces the activation energy required for the reaction to proceed.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
