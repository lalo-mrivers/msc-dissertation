["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking how several different proteins can be produced from the same gene. We know that post-translational modifications of proteins can lead to diverse protein products. Additionally, we have documents on amino acid composition and recombinant DNA methodology for protein engineering. It's likely that alternative RNA splicing or post-translational modifications are playing a role here.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
