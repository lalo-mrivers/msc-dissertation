["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, we can analyze the effects of exercise on various physiological parameters. In this case, we are given information about oxygen uptake, blood pressure, arterial blood gases, and arterial concentrations of glucose, insulin, and growth hormone during different types of exercise. The documents also mention that blood pressure rose more in obese individuals during exercise than in lean ones.\n\nConsidering the scenario where men between 20-30 years old perform a 15-minute session on a treadmill with an average pulse of 175/min during the last two minutes, we can deduce that the physical exertion is moderate to high. Given this information, it's likely that some physiological parameters will increase in response to exercise.\n\nOne parameter that might decrease during exercise compared to pre-exercise levels is stroke volume. According to the documents on endurance training of older men, stroke volume increases with training, but decreases with acute exercise or stress.\n\nAdditionally, another factor that could influence stroke volume is the individual's physical fitness level. Fitter individuals tend to have lower stroke volumes at rest and during exercise compared to less fit ones.\n\nHowever, pulse pressure is unlikely to decrease significantly with exercise. In fact, studies show that pulse pressure tends to increase in response to exercise due to increased cardiac output and peripheral resistance.\n\nSystolic blood pressure typically increases during exercise as the heart pumps more blood to meet the oxygen demand of muscles. Hence, it's also unlikely to decrease during the last minute of a 15-minute session on a treadmill.\n\nTotal peripheral resistance is another factor that might increase during exercise due to vasoconstriction and increased sympathetic tone.\n\nBased on these observations, we can conclude that stroke volume is most likely to be decreased during the last minute of exercise compared to pre-exercise levels.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
