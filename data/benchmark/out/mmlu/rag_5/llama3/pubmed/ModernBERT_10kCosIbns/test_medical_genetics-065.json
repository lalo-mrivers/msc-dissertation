["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the usefulness of simple tandem repeat polymorphisms in humans. The relevant documents discuss the use of trimeric and tetrameric tandem repeats as highly polymorphic markers for personal identification in the medical and forensic sciences, but do not specifically mention solving criminal and paternity cases or estimating relationships between humans and Neanderthals.\n\nThe document 'Isolation and chromosomal assignment of 100 highly informative human simple sequence repeat polymorphisms' reports the isolation and mapping of 100 highly informative simple sequence repeat (SSR) polymorphisms, which have heterozygosities greater than 0.50 and can be amplified using identical PCR conditions.\n\nBased on this information, it is reasonable to conclude that simple tandem repeat polymorphisms in humans are most useful for...\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
