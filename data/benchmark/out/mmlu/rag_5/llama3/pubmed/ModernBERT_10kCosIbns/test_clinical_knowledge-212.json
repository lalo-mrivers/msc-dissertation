["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks which of the following is true about Paget's Disease. We have to go through each document to find relevant information that supports one of the options. In 'Spinal manifestations of Paget's disease', we see that spinal canal stenosis, paraplegia or paraparesis are syndromes that affect the spine as a result of Paget's disease. This suggests that spinal cord compression is indeed a complication. We also have other documents like '[The neurologic complications of Paget's disease]', '[Biological exploration of Paget's disease]', '[Anatomopathology of Paget's disease. Combined approach by conventional methods and ultrastructural study]', and 'Pathologic fractures of the hand in Paget's disease', which do not provide direct information about spinal cord compression. Therefore, option B is true.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B\n}"]
