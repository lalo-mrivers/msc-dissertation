["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the given documents, we can infer that the transcription of DNA to a molecule of messenger RNA occurs in the nucleus (document 4: \\\"Transcription of rat liver deoxyribonucleic acid in vitro at low ionic strength\\\" mentions that RNA polymerase is in excess over DNA and that double-stranded DNA is required for stable initiation complexes, which suggests that transcription takes place in the nucleus. Similarly, document 6: \\\"On pre-messenger RNA and transcriptions. A review.\\\" states that activated transcriptons produce pre-mRNA, which are colinear with the DNA of the transcriptional unit, indicating that transcription occurs in the nucleus.).\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
