["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has a long history of varying physical symptoms without definitive causes. Despite extensive diagnostic studies, consultations with many physicians, and several surgical explorations, no clear cause was found. The patient also gives dramatic and exaggerated descriptions of her present and past symptoms and makes conflicting statements about her history.
