["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents discuss the concept of redox potential of tissues, organs, and whole patients. Lactic acidosis is a condition where anaerobic synthesis of lactate occurs as an emergency reaction to supply minimum energy to tissues with insufficient oxygen supply. The rate of blood lactate accumulation is determined by the balance between lactate production and clearance. Muscle lactate production and efflux are important factors that influence this balance.\",\n\"answer_choice\": A"]
