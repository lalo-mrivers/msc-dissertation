["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe Neonatal Respiratory Distress Syndrome (NRDS) as a complication caused by inadequate surfactant production. Surfactant is necessary for facilitating oxygen diffusion across alveolar membranes. In the 'Mucus rheology and transport in neonatal respiratory distress syndrome...' document, it states that surfactant deficiency could alter the properties of respiratory mucus in such a way that it would be poorly cleared from airways and promote airway luminal obstruction. This suggests that surfactant plays a crucial role in maintaining alveoli in an open state.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
