["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about modifying protein structure after translation has occurred. The options provided are lipidation, attachment of more amino acids via peptide bonds, glycosylation, and phosphorylation. Upon reviewing the relevant documents, I noticed that there is no mention of attaching more amino acids via peptide bonds as a means to modify protein structure. This process would imply elongating or modifying the primary sequence of the translated protein, which is not described in any of the provided texts.\n\nInstead, the texts focus on mechanisms regulating translation initiation and termination, as well as post-translational modifications such as lipidation (Ayerst Award Lecture 1976), glycosylation, and phosphorylation (Intracellular messengers and the control of protein synthesis). Phosphorylation is mentioned as a means to regulate translation globally.\n\nGiven this information, I conclude that attachment of more amino acids via peptide bonds is not used to modify protein structure after translation has occurred.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
