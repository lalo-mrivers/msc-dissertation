["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 16-year-old boy with a 3-day history of abdominal pain and vomiting. He has decreased appetite during this period. The pain initially started on the right side but now has become generalized. His temperature is high, pulse is rapid, and blood pressure is elevated. On physical examination, there is guarding with diffuse rebound tenderness, suggesting an acute abdomen. A CT scan shows a perforated appendix, which is a surgical emergency.\n\nThe most important factors that help identify the high-risk patient with an acute surgical abdomen are pain for less than 48 hours, pain followed by vomiting, and guarding and rebound tenderness on physical examination (White et al.). The patient's symptoms, including abdominal pain and vomiting, suggest an early missed diagnosis in the emergency clinic.\n\nThe presence of these features demands careful evaluation and a liberal policy of admission and observation. Laboratory tests such as white blood cell counts, body temperature, and abnormal abdominal roentgenograms may add confirmatory evidence but are not particularly helpful as screening devices.\n\nIn this case, the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings suggest an acute surgical abdomen due to a perforated appendix. The goal is to rapidly and accurately diagnose the patient preoperatively and provide a timely referral to the appropriate surgeon or gynecologist (Guidelines for rapid assessment of abdominal pain indicative of acute surgical abdomen).\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
