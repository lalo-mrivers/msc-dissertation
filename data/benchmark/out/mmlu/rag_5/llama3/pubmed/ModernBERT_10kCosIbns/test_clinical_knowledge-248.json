["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about where DNA transcription to messenger RNA occurs. The relevant documents describe various aspects of gene expression, including the transcription process. According to the document 'Transcription of rat liver deoxyribonucleic acid in vitro at low ionic strength', the enzyme RNA polymerase recognizes single-stranded breaks in DNA as initiation sites for transcription. This suggests that transcription takes place in a specific location where the enzyme can access the DNA. The document does not mention ribosomes, cytosol, or cell division, but it mentions the nucleus and nucleoli.\n\nAnother relevant document describes the use of mercurated nucleoside triphosphate as a probe in transcription studies in vitro. It states that purified form A RNA polymerase and the endogenous, nuclear form A RNA polymerase incorporate 5-mercuri-uridine 5'-triphosphate (Hg-UTP) into RNA in vitro.\n\nBased on this information, it appears that DNA transcription to messenger RNA occurs in the nucleus.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
