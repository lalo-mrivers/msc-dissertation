["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks which of the given disorders does not show X-linked inheritance. We can start by looking at the provided documents. From the document 'Problems in diagnosis and delineation of inherited disorders in highly inbred populations', we know that Martin Bell Syndrome is an X-linked disease. This gives us a hint that some of the disorders mentioned might be X-linked.\n\nFrom the same document, we also learn that in inbred communities, individuals affected with X-linked diseases are often born to parents who are related. This further supports the possibility that at least one of the given disorders is X-linked.\n\nLooking at the options, A: Duchenne muscular dystrophy, B: Tay-Sachs disease, C: Haemophilia A, and D: Haemophilia B, we know from various sources (not provided in this document) that A: Duchenne muscular dystrophy and C: Haemophilia A are X-linked disorders. This leaves us with two possibilities: B: Tay-Sachs disease or D: Haemophilia B.\n\nAccording to the document 'Identifiying inherited disease through the family history', autosomal recessive inheritance is characterized by a pair of alleles, one from each parent. This type of inheritance does not involve sex chromosomes and therefore cannot be X-linked. Comparing this with our options, we see that B: Tay-Sachs disease is an autosomal recessive disorder, which makes it the correct answer.\n\nFinally, we can rule out D: Haemophilia B as an option since it is also mentioned in the document 'Problems in diagnosis and delineation of inherited disorders in highly inbred populations' as an X-linked disease.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
