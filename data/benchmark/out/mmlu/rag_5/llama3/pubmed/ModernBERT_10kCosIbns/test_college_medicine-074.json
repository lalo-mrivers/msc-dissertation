["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the expected phenotypic ratios of the offspring when an affected male with MERRF syndrome reproduces with a normal female. From the documents, we know that MERRF is caused by a mutation in the tRNA(Lys) gene of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). This mutation can be present at varying levels in the mother's cells and is not always inherited by her offspring. The level of the mutated mtDNA in the mother's cells affects the probability of transmission to the offspring. If the mother has a high percentage of the mutated mtDNA, it is likely that all her children will inherit some amount of the mutation. However, if the mother has a lower percentage of the mutated mtDNA, there may be a mix of affected and unaffected offspring. Therefore, we need to consider the level of the mutated mtDNA in the mother's cells when predicting the expected phenotypic ratios of the offspring.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
