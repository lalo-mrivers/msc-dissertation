["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about enzyme assay for identifying carriers. From the given documents, we can see that R factors are plasmids conferring resistance to antibacterial agents. Enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay (ELISA) is mentioned as a method for qualitative identification of mutants and antigens. Since R factors are responsible for the epidemic spread of multiple drug-resistance, an enzyme assay could be used to identify carriers of R factors. This would involve detecting the presence of specific enzymes or proteins related to the plasmid.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
