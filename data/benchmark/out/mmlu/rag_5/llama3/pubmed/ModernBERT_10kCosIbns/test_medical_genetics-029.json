["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the probability that each child of two parents affected with an autosomal recessive disorder will also be affected. Since it's an autosomal recessive disorder, the parents are both carriers and each has one copy of the recessive allele. The child can inherit one copy from each parent or none at all. Since the parents are both affected, they must have inherited two copies of the recessive allele (one from each parent). Therefore, each child will also inherit two copies of the recessive allele if they receive the recessive allele from both parents. This means that each child has a 100% chance of being affected with the disorder.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B\n}"]
