["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has a palpable nodule in the right lobe of the thyroid gland. The serum TSH concentration is within the reference range, which suggests that the nodule may be autonomous or toxic. Ultrasonography confirms the presence of a solid 1-cm nodule. To further evaluate the nodule, we should first consider the diagnostic program proposed by us, starting with in-vitro diagnostics specific for the thyroid gland. The sequence of description (BEJ, T4-test, T3-test, FT4-index, RIA-T3 and RIA-TSH) results in a diagnostic step program that can help classify functional disturbances of the thyroid gland. In this case, we should perform the RIA-T4 test to determine if the nodule is autonomous or toxic.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
