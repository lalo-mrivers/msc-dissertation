["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The provided documents suggest that during multiple sprint activities, fatigue occurs due to the depletion of creatine phosphate (CP) stores. This is evident from the Fatigue and changes of ATP, creatine phosphate, and lactate during the 400-m sprint document where CP concentrations had decreased by 89% after 400 meters. Additionally, the Constituents of human muscle in isometric fatigue study shows that changes in CP and lactate were large after fatigue at intermediate tensions.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
