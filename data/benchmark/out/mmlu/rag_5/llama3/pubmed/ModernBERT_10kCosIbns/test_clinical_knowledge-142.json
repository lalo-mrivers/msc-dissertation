["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The study on the origin of contractile force in skeletal muscle explains that the instantaneous tension response (T1) after a step change in length appears to have its origin in compliance within the coil region of S-2, which is formed through helix melting at the moment of force generation. This suggests that the trigger to initiate the contractile process is not related to potassium binding, ATP binding or tropomyosin/troponin binding. Therefore, calcium binding to troponin is the most likely trigger.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
