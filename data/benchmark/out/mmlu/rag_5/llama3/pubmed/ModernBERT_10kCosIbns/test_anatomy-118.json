["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the provided documents, it can be seen that univentricular hearts are characterized by a single ventricular chamber. In the case of double outlet right ventricle with subpulmonary ventricular septal defect and related hearts (the Taussig-Bing group), the atrioventricular bundle lies in the inferior wall of the defect on the left side beneath the summit of the ventricular septum. This suggests that the atrioventricular valve is not a semilunar valve, as option A describes. The text also mentions that all leaflets of the posterior cusp were shorter than the anterior cusp, and that the intermediate leaflet was wider and higher than the other two. This indicates that the right atrioventricular valve is not prevented from everting by papillary muscles, as option B suggests. Furthermore, it can be inferred that the right atrioventricular valve does not complete during systole, as option C implies, since this would contradict the normal physiological functioning of the heart. Finally, the text states that all leaflets of the posterior cusp were shorter than the anterior cusp, which means that the right atrioventricular valve does not prevent blood returning from the pulmonary trunk as the heart relaxes, as option D suggests.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
