["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the presence of two or more cell lines from different zygotes in a single individual. The relevant documents mention triploidy, mosaicism, and chimaerism. Mosaicism refers to the presence of cells with different genetic content within an embryo, which can occur after irregular chromosome distribution following tripolar cleavage division. Chimaerism is also mentioned as occurring when embryos resulting from multipronuclear zygotes do not reflect the genetic content of the whole embryo. Diploidy and aneuploidy are terms related to chromosomal abnormalities, but they do not directly relate to the presence of cell lines from different zygotes. Therefore, the correct answer is D: chimaerism.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
