["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the structure and replication of adenovirus DNA. The question asks about the normal pairing of adenine with another nucleotide base in DNA. Since this is a basic characteristic of DNA structure, we can look for information on the composition of adenovirus DNA. In one of the documents, it is mentioned that both molecular ends of type 2 as well as of type 5 DNA terminate with the sequence ...pCpC...pGpApTpG3', which suggests that adenine is not paired with uracil (since this is characteristic of RNA, not DNA). The other options are all possible pairing partners for adenine in DNA: cytosine, guanine, and thymine. Therefore, we can conclude that adenine normally pairs with...\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
