["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks which agent will induce polyploidy in a dividing eukaryote. Polyploidy is the process of increasing the number of chromosomes in an organism. The relevant documents discuss polyploidy in plants and animals, including laboratory mice. From these documents, we can infer that spontaneous chromosome doubling or the formation and sexual functioning of cytologically non-reduced gametes are modes of polyploid evolution. However, these processes occur naturally and may not be induced by external agents. In contrast, the document 'Deleterious mutations and the origin of the meiotic ploidy cycle' suggests that haploid behavior can be an evolutionarily attainable stable trait when a certain condition holds. This does not directly relate to inducing polyploidy. The other documents do not provide direct information on agents that induce polyploidy. Therefore, we must rely on general knowledge of eukaryotic cell biology and the context of the question.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
