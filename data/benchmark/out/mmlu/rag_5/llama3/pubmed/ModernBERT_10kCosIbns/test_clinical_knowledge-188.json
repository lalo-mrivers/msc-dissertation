["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the provided documents, it can be inferred that glycolysis is a complex biochemical process with multiple enzymes involved. The document 'A simulation study of oscillating glycolysis' describes the feedback control of PFK by adenylates, which allows the system to oscillate. This suggests that phosphofructokinase (PFK) plays an important role in glycolysis and may be rate-limiting. Additionally, the document 'Mathematical analysis of multienzyme systems' discusses the kinetics of the master enzyme phosphofructokinase. This further supports the idea that PFK is a key enzyme in glycolysis and likely rate-limiting.\", \"answer_choice\": D}"]
