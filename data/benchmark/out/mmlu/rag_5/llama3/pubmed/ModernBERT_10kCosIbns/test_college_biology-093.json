["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking which statement about fungi is NOT true. The relevant documents provide information on the genetic aspects of opportunistic fungi, their spectrum, histological aspects, evolutionary relationships within the fungi, and molecular evolution of human pathogens. From these documents, we can infer that fungi are eukaryotic (document [Genetic aspects of opportunistic fungi]), they have different types of cell walls depending on the genus (documents [Spectrum of opportunistic filamentous fungi] and [Histological aspects of mycoses provoked by opportunistic fungi]), some are filamentous (document [Spectrum of opportunistic filamentous fungi]), and most are not photosynthetic (document [Evolutionary relationships within the fungi]). Therefore, we can conclude that none of the given statements about fungi are NOT true.\", \"answer_choice\": C"]
