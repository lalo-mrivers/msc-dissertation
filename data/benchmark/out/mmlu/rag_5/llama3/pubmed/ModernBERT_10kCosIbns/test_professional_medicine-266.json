["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with sudden onset of pain and swelling of her right knee, no history of injury. She has mild osteoarthritis for which she takes ibuprofen occasionally. The examination shows warmth, erythema, and effusion, with exquisite tenderness on minimal range-of-motion testing. Synovial fluid aspiration reveals clear fluid with positively birefringent rhomboids under polarized light microscopy. Given the presence of positively birefringent rhomboids, it is likely that the patient has an inflammatory reaction in her knee joint. The most common cause of this type of inflammatory reaction is gouty arthritis. Gouty arthritis is characterized by deposition of monosodium urate crystals, which are positively birefringent under polarized light microscopy. Therefore, the most likely cause of these findings is the deposition of ammonium urate.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
