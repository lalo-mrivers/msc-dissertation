["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about an allele that is masked. After reviewing the provided documents, I didn't find any direct reference to a 'masked' allele. However, the concept of an allele becoming extinct or having its frequency change over time due to various factors (mutation rate, selection, and random genetic drift) is discussed in some of the papers. This led me to focus on the persistence of common alleles in two related populations or species (document 3). The term 'masked' doesn't seem to be used explicitly, but it might imply an allele that is not expressed or has its effect suppressed.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
