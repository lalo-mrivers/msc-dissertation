["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the net production of ATP via substrate-level phosphorylation in glycolysis. Glucose is converted to pyruvate through glycolysis, which involves substrate-level phosphorylation that produces ATP. Glycogen is not directly related to this process. The key point is the number of ATP molecules produced from glucose.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: 3 from glucose and 2 from glycogen.\""]
