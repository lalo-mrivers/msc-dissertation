["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The ratio of purines to pyrimidines is determined by the sequence of DNA. Since the question refers to a double-stranded molecule of DNA, we can analyze the provided documents related to DNA structure and properties. The first document describes the computer model of DNA-histone functioning like a computer, which mentions informational gates and electronic wave transmission between nucleotide bases. This suggests that the sequence of DNA affects the ratio of purines to pyrimidines. Additionally, the stability of pyrimidine oligodeoxyribonucleotides released during degradation of deoxyribonucleic acid with formic acid-diphenylamine reagent also implies a relationship between the sequence and the ratio.\n\nThe third document discusses the formation of phosphonester bonds catalyzed by DNA polymerase, which involves 3'-fluo- ro-2',3'-dideoxythymidine 5'-(alpha-methylphosphonyl)-beta,gamma-diphosphate and 2'-deoxythymidine-5'-(alpha-methylphosphonyl)-beta,gamma-diphosphate. Although this document is primarily about enzyme activity, it highlights the importance of DNA sequence in determining the ratio.\n\nThe last document describes alternating d(G-A) sequences forming a parallel-stranded DNA homoduplex with stable double-helical structure. This implies that the sequence affects the structure and properties of DNA, including the ratio of purines to pyrimidines.\",\n\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
