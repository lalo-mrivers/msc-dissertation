["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about an object resting on a plane with an angle of incline, acceleration due to gravity, and coefficient of friction. The problem can be broken down into two parts: the component of the force acting down the plane (gravity) and the force resisting motion along the plane (friction). The key is to determine how these forces combine to produce the net force on the object. Since the angle of incline is given, we can use it to calculate the component of gravity acting down the plane using the sine function. Then, we need to subtract the frictional force from this component to find the net force and acceleration.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
