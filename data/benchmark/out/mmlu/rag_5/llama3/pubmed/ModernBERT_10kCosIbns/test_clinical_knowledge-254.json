["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to the provided documents, we know that plethysmography follows the principle of the relaxed wall of the vessel. The pressure is adjusted in a finger cuff and by means of a pneumatic regulation is varied in such a way that the light plethysmogram of the adequate finger does not show any more pulsations. This indicates that the pressure recorded is the pressure in the finger arteries, which corresponds to the pressure in the arm above the level of the heart. Therefore, measuring the blood pressure in an arm that is above the level of the heart will underestimate the blood pressure.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
