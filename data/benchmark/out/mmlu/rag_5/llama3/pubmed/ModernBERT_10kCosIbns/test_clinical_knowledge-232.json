["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The article 'Glyconeogenic and oxidative lactate utilization in skeletal muscle' suggests that the two primary fates of lactate in skeletal muscle are oxidation and glycogen synthesis. Since we are looking for the main fate of lactate that leaves muscle and enters circulation, we can rule out options A (conversion to urea in the liver) and B (conversion to glucose in the heart). The article also mentions that oxidation is quantitatively the most important means of disposing of lactate, whether in exercising or nonexercising muscle. Additionally, 'A novel role for epinephrine is considered that may be important for the mitochondrial oxidation of lactate', suggesting that oxidation of lactate is not only important but also influenced by epinephrine. Therefore, we can conclude that the main fate of lactate that leaves muscle and enters circulation is likely to be oxidation.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
