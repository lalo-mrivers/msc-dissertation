["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking which tissue in an actively photosynthesizing plant would have the highest rate of oxygen production. From the provided documents, we can infer that plants are able to evolve oxygen through a process called water oxidation or oxygen evolution. This process occurs within chlorophyllous cells, specifically in the palisade mesophyll and spongy mesophyll layers.\n\nWe can also see from the [Model of an ecological system closed as regards gas metabolism and with a periodically working autotrophic component] that the conditions required to maintain the stability of the atmosphere include equal quantities of oxygen and carbon dioxide consumed and produced by the components of the system during any time period. This suggests that oxygen production is closely linked to photosynthesis, which occurs in chlorophyllous cells.\n\nTherefore, it is reasonable to conclude that the tissue with the highest rate of oxygen production would be the one where most of the photosynthetic activity occurs.\", \"answer_choice\": B}"]
