["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about reflexes, specifically the plantar reflex, ankle reflex, and knee reflex. We need to look at the provided documents for information on these topics. The first document discusses reflex action and drive-controlled reflexes, which doesn't seem directly relevant to this question. The second document is about behavior theory and response, but it also mentions reflex theory. The third document talks about electrophysiologic tests of human reflexes, including the F wave, H reflex, T reflex, tonic vibration reflex, and blink reflex. None of these are specifically related to the plantar, ankle, or knee reflexes.\n\nThe fourth document discusses conditioned avoidance reflex and intersignal movements, which is not relevant to this question either. Therefore, we need to look for information on the root values of the ankle and knee reflexes in the third document, which mentions electrophysiologic tests. The text does not explicitly mention these specific reflexes, but it talks about F waves, H reflexes, T reflexes, tonic vibration reflexes, and blink reflexes.\n\nFrom this information, we can infer that the root values of the ankle and knee reflexes are not mentioned in the provided documents. Therefore, we cannot determine their root values from these texts.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
