["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The experiment involves asking subjects to learn a series of facts, then recalling them. The factors that might affect the outcome are: compensation amount ($10 or $20), learning time (15 minutes or 30 minutes), and recall location (same room or unfamiliar setting). Therefore, the dependent variables in this experiment are the measures that will be affected by these factors. Specifically, it is likely that the number of facts the subjects can recall (III) will vary depending on the combination of compensation amount, learning time, and recall location.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: I and III and IV only\"\n}"]
