["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the effect of low external pH on mitochondria's ability to manufacture ATP. The relevant documents discuss various aspects of mitochondrial function, including proton electrochemical gradient and phosphate potential, oxygen exchange reactions catalyzed by mitochondrial adenosine triphosphatase preparations, involvement of phosphate-modified ATP analogs in the reactions of oxidative phosphorylation, demonstration and quantitation of catalytic and noncatalytic bound ATP in submitochondrial particles during oxidative phosphorylation, and 31P NMR saturation-transfer study of the in situ kinetics of the mitochondrial adenine nucleotide translocase. The key point is that mitochondria maintain a proton gradient across their inner membranes, which drives ATP synthesis.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
