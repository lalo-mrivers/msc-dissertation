["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has a history of painful swelling over the sacral prominence that began after a fall during a high school wrestling match. The patient has a low-grade fever. Examination reveals an erythematous, fluctuant, elevated mass with 3 midline pores. Rectal examination reveals no induration or pain.
