["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks what is the ratio of A:T in the newly synthesized complementary strand of DNA. Since DNA polymerase creates new DNA by adding complimentary nucleotides to a template strand from the original double-stranded DNA, we need to analyze how DNA polymerase works.\n\nFrom the provided documents, we know that DNA polymerase incorporates nucleotides into DNA by adding complimentary nucleotides to a template strand. The incorporation of nucleotides is not of a terminal transferase-type but rather a very limited repair synthesis in which one or a few triphosphates are incorporated at numerous 3'-hydroxyl ends.\n\nSince the template strand has a ratio of 3:2 of A:T bases, we need to consider how DNA polymerase incorporates nucleotides. We can infer that DNA polymerase will maintain this ratio in the newly synthesized complementary strand of DNA, as it is adding complimentary nucleotides to the template strand.\n\nTherefore, the ratio of A:T in the newly synthesized complementary strand of DNA will be 3:2.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
