["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"An increase in the inbreeding coefficient (F) means an increase in the degree of selfing or mating between relatives. This can lead to a reduction in heterozygosity as individuals become more homozygous due to their shared genetic background. Therefore, an increase in F is likely to result in reduced likelihood of heterozygotes being present in a population.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
