["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The zygomatic arch is formed by the union of the zygomatic bone with another process. This can be inferred from the studies that describe the surgical intervention on the zygomatic arch and its possible influence on craniofacial growth and development. It is mentioned that when only one zygomatic arch is sectioned, the posterior root of the sectioned side appears to be displaced posteriorly. This suggests that there is a process that joins with the zygomatic bone to form the zygomatic arch. The relevant studies do not explicitly mention which bone this process belongs to, but we can infer it from the anatomical context.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B\n}"]
