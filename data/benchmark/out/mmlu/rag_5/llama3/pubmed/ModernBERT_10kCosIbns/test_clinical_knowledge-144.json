["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the energy charge of a cell. The relevant documents describe different aspects of cellular energetics. Based on the discovery that Na+ can substitute for H+ as an energy coupling ion, cells can possess three convertible energy currencies: ATP, protonic, and sodium potentials. This suggests that the energy charge may refer to one of these energies. However, another possibility is that the energy charge refers to the overall rate of energy use by the cell or the extent to which the total adenine nucleotide pool is phosphorylated.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
