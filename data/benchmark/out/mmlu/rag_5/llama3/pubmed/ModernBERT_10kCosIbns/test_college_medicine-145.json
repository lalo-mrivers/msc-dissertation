["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the provided documents, we can see that lactate has two primary fates in skeletal muscle: (1) oxidation and (2) glycogen synthesis. Oxidation of lactate is quantitatively the most important means of disposing of lactate, whether in exercising or nonexercising muscle. The article 'Myocardial lactate extraction and release at rest and during heavy exercise in healthy men' suggests that myocardial lactate extraction dominates over other substrates (mainly free fatty acids and glucose) taken up by the heart, and used for oxidation by the heart muscle cells. This implies that lactate is primarily oxidized in other tissues, including the heart.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
