["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the polytene chromosomes seen in Drosophila silvantis with the aid of a light microscope. The relevant documents provide information about the pattern of polytene chromosome synapsis in Drosophila species and interspecific hybrids. According to this study, definite chromosome regions exhibiting high pairing frequency serve as initiation sites of synapsis in salivary gland chromosomes. This suggests that polytene chromosomes are produced by repeated rounds of DNA replication followed by nuclear division.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
