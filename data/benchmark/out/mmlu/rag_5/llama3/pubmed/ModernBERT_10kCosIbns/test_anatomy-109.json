["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the location of an extradural haemorrhage based on MRI scan. Extradural haemorrhages occur outside the dura mater. The relevant document is [Emergency surgery in district hospital: massive hemorrhage after blunt abdominal injury] which mentions 'no immediate medical care by a physician, delay in sending the patient to hospital, long journey time and alcoholic damage to the liver and CNS.' However, this document does not provide information about extradural haemorrhages. The relevant document is [Intracerebral hemorrhage from the neurosurgical viewpoint] which discusses surgical strategies for treatment of intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH). It mentions that the main factors for surgical intervention for ICH are degree of midline shift, deformation of neurological deficit or consciousness-level and ventricular enlargement. But it does not provide information about extradural haemorrhages. The relevant document is [Recognizing spontaneous spinal epidural hematoma] which discusses diagnosis and treatment of spinal epidural haematoma. It mentions that the cause may be a fall or straining but in most cases there's no history of trauma. However, this document does not provide information about extradural haemorrhages. The relevant document is [Abdominal emergencies in the daily practice of a traumatology center] which analyses 57 cases of abdominal trauma occurring in patients with multiple injuries admitted to the accident unit. It mentions various types of injuries such as hepatic and splenic lesions but it does not provide information about extradural haemorrhages. The relevant document is [Delayed onset of intraventricular hemorrhage following removal of acute subdural hematoma--case report] which discusses delayed traumatic intraventricular haemorrhage after removal of acute subdural haematoma. It mentions decompressive rupture of damaged subependymal veins as the cause of the delayed traumatic intraventricular haemorrhage. However, this document does not provide information about extradural haemorrhages. The only relevant document that provides information about extradural haemorrhages is [Emergency surgery in district hospital: massive hemorrhage after blunt abdominal injury] which mentions 'laparotomy for massive haemorrhage after abdominal injuries' but it does not specify the location of the haemorrhage.\", \"answer_choice\": A}"]
