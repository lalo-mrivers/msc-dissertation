["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the first document, we can see that plasma glucose decreased during prolonged fasting. However, this study is different from our current question which focuses on intermittent high-intensity exercise. The second document shows that plasma glucose increased during intense exercise to exhaustion and then abruptly declined at 4 min recovery, before gradually declining. This suggests that blood glucose concentration does not remain constant during exercise but changes significantly. In the third document, we can see that carbohydrate supplementation delays fatigue by maintaining blood glucose concentration. Finally, in the fourth document, it is mentioned that there is a progressive shift from muscle glycogen to blood glucose oxidation with increasing duration of exercise.\n\nConsidering these points, I conclude that blood glucose concentration during 80-90 minutes of intermittent high-intensity exercise will frequently rise.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
