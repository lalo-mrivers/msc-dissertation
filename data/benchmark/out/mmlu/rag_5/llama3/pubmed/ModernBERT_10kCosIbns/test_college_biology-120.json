["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about a subunit of DNA and protein consisting of 134-base-pair long stretches of DNA surrounding a protein octamer. This description matches the concept of a nucleosome, which is a DNA-protein complex that consists of a segment of DNA wrapped around a core of eight histone proteins (two each of histones H2A, H2B, H3, and H4). The 134-base-pair long stretches of DNA are characteristic of nucleosomes.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
