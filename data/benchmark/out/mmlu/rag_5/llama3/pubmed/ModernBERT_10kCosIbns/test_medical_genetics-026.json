["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The main point of Angelman syndrome is a deletion on the maternal copy of chromosome 15. This information can be found in multiple documents, including 'Angelman's syndrome: a neuropathological study', 'DNA deletion and its parental origin in Angelman syndrome patients', and 'Deletion of 15q12 in Angelman syndrome: report of 3 new cases'.

Therefore, a maternal uniparental disomy (UPD) 15 or a deletion on the maternally derived chromosome 15 would result in Angelman syndrome.\", \"answer_choice\": A}"]
