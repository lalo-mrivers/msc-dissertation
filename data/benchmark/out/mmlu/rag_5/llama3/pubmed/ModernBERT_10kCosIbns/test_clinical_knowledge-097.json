["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe respiratory muscle fatigue during exercise, changes in ATP, creatine phosphate, and lactate during the 400-m sprint, skeletal muscle enzyme alterations after sprint and endurance training, dose/response effects of exercise modeled from training: physical and biochemical measures, and constituents of human muscle in isometric fatigue. The question is about peripheral muscle fatigue during multiple sprint activities. Based on the study Fatigue and changes of ATP, creatine phosphate, and lactate during the 400-m sprint, it is observed that after 200 m, ATP and CP concentrations had decreased by 27% and 89%, respectively, and M-La had increased to 17.3 +/- 0.9 mmol/kg. It was concluded that complete fatigue occurred when CP stores were depleted and B-La and M-La attained an individual maximum.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
