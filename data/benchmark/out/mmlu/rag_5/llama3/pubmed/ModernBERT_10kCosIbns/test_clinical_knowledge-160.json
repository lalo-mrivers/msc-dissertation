["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The conversion of glucose to pyruvate involves the pyruvate dehydrogenase reaction. This reaction is responsible for the irreversible loss of glucose carbon by oxidation. Regulation of this reaction is a major determinant of glucose conservation in starvation and diabetes. The enzyme pyruvate dehydrogenase catalyzes the decarboxylation and dehydrogenation of pyruvate to form acetyl-CoA, NADH, and CO2.\n\nThe conversion of one molecule of glucose to two molecules of pyruvate results in the net formation of...\",\n\n\"answer_choice\": \"A: six molecules of water\"\n}"]
