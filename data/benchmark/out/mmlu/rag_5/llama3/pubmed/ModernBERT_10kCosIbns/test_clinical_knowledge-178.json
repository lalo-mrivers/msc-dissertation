["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents discuss enzymatic control mechanisms, enzymic regulations, kinetic behaviour of enzymes, structural features of enzyme molecules, metabolic function, and adaptations of enzymes for regulation of catalytic function. These discussions suggest that enzymes are functional units of complex chemical systems that can be affected by various factors to regulate their activity. The most relevant information is provided in the 'Adaptations of enzymes for regulation of catalytic function' document, which highlights temperature as a factor affecting enzyme activity.\", \"answer_choice\": D}"]
