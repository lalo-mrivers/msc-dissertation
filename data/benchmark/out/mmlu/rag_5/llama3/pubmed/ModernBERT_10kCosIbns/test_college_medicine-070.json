["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to the concept of hormonal control of glucose metabolism, glucagon and insulin are the two major hormones that work together to regulate glucose homeostasis. Glucagon stimulates gluconeogenesis, while insulin suppresses it. This process is closely related to the synthesis of glucose from various precursors such as lactate, glycerol, or amino acids. Therefore, based on this information, the correct answer should be related to the pathway of glucose synthesis from these precursors.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: gluconeogenesis\""]
