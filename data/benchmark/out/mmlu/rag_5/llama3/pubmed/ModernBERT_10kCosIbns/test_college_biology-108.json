["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about how marine birds maintain their tissue osmolarity when they drink seawater. The relevant documents provide information on physiological adjustments made by diving mammals and birds to cope with submersion asphyxia. Since this question specifically asks about marine birds, we can focus on the metabolic consequences of submersion asphyxia in mammals and birds. It is stated that arterial pO2 will inevitably decrease throughout the underwater episode, but the ischaemia in peripheral tissues will result in a profound decrease in temperature of tissues such as skin.\n\nThe question also asks about osmotic problems arising from rapid wash-out of acidic metabolic end products from previously ischaemic tissues on emergence. This suggests that marine birds may have mechanisms to deal with these problems. The answer choice options provide various physiological strategies for maintaining tissue osmolarity.\n\nUpon reviewing the answer choices, option A seems most relevant as it describes a process where marine birds absorb water and produce dilute urine in their kidneys, which would help maintain their internal osmolarity.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
