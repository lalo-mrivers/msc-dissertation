["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the structure of human mitochondrial DNA variation, which shows that mtDNA exhibits more interpopulation heterogeneity (GST = 0.351 +/- 0.025) than does nuclear DNA (GST = 0.12). This suggests that mtDNA is a good marker for studying the relatedness of animal populations. Additionally, the documents discuss the use of restriction enzyme maps to estimate sequence divergence and the distribution of pairwise sequence differences in stable and exponentially growing populations.\", \"answer_choice\": B}"]
