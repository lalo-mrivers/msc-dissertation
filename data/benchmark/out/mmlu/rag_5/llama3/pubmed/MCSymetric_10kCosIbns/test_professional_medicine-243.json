["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about prophylaxis of deep venous thrombosis for a patient who has undergone an uncomplicated left total knee replacement. The patient is receiving fentanyl and has medical history of coronary artery disease, taking various medications. Baseline echocardiogram shows an ejection fraction of 0.20. Vital signs show a temperature of 38.0Â°C, pulse 90/min, respirations 16/min, and blood pressure 130/90 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 96%. Physical examination discloses no unexpected abnormalities.\n\nThe relevant documents provide information on the prevention of venous thrombosis in surgery. Avoid immobilization before and immediately after the operation. Apply elastic support bandages to the lower limbs before, during, and after the operation. Give aspirin before and after the operation: 3 X 0,50 g.\n\nGeneral prophylaxis is indicated for its effective prevention of postoperative venous thrombosis. The pathophysiology of venous thrombosis is determined mainly by the triad of Virchow (hypocirculation, endothelial lesion of vessels, coagulation disturbances). Various predisposing factors are known.\n\nThe value of the postoperative temperature chart as an aid to the diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis. Forty consecutive patients with an abnormal postoperative pyrexia were investigated for deep vein thrombosis (DVT). All 80 lower limbs were examined by means of Parks 801 or 806 Doppler ultrasound apparatus.\n\nProphylaxis of deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. Clinically silent deep venous thrombosis (DVT) develops in up to 25% of patients who undergo general surgical procedures. Approximately 10% of these thromboses are complicated by potentially fatal pulmonary embolism.\n\nIncidence of deep venous thromboses in traumatology and methods of early detection. In this work carried out at the Traumatology Centre in Strasbourg, out of 227 patients operated for a fracture situated between the pelvis and the tibial plateau, the authors endeavoured to show a thrombosis of the lower limbs.\n\nGiven these documents, we can see that general prophylaxis is indicated for its effective prevention of postoperative venous thrombosis. The patient has undergone an uncomplicated left total knee replacement and has no unexpected abnormalities on physical examination.\n\nTherefore, we would recommend the following regimen for prophylaxis of deep venous thrombosis: Subcutaneous enoxaparin.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
