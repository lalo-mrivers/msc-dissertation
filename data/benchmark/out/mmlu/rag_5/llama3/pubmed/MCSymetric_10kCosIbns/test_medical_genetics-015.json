["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"QTL analysis is a method used to identify chromosome regions associated with a complex trait. The provided documents suggest that the focus is on predicting risk for genetic disorders and understanding the relative contribution of allelic variations of a particular gene to disease. Linkage analysis, which is an important method in genetic counseling situations, involves evaluating a closely linked marker when a gene cannot be detected directly. This suggests that QTL analysis is used to identify chromosome regions associated with a complex trait in a genetic cross.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
