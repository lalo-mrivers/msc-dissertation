["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for a disorder that does not show X-linked inheritance. From the provided documents, we can see that X-linked mental retardation is transmitted by an apparently unaffected male, and the family pedigree record shows a trait being passed from father to daughter but not to sons. This suggests X-linked inheritance. The same applies to Martin Bell Syndrome. Haemophilia A and C are also mentioned as being inherited in an X-linked fashion. Tay-Sachs disease is not mentioned at all in the provided documents, so we can't determine its inheritance pattern. However, it is a classic example of autosomal recessive inheritance.\n\nThe only option that does not show X-linked inheritance is B: Tay-Sachs disease.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
