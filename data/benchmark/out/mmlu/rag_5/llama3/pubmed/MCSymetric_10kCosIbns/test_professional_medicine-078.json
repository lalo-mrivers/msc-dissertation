["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To calculate the sensitivity of this test, we need to know how many true positives (people with prostate cancer) there are among those who tested positive for the blood test. This means we need to compare the results of the biopsy procedures to the serum PSA concentrations. Based on the text, we know that 90 out of 100 men who underwent biopsy had prostate cancer, and all these men had serum PSA concentrations greater than 5 ng/mL. Therefore, we can assume that the sensitivity is high among those with serum PSA concentrations greater than 5 ng/mL.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
