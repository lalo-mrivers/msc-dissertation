["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about microsatellite instability, which refers to the frequent changes in the number of repeat units within a microsatellite. Microsatellites are tandem repeats of simple sequence that occur abundantly and at random throughout most eukaryotic genomes. Since they are usually less than 100 bp long and are embedded in DNA with unique sequence, they can be amplified in vitro using the polymerase chain reaction. This instability is sufficient to use in genetic analyses.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
