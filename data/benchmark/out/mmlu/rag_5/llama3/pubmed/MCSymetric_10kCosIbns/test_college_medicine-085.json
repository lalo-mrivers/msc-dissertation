["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the location and function of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex. From the provided documents, we can see that the structure of the complex is composed of multiple subunits, including alpha2beta2 subunits from pig heart pyruvate dehydrogenase. The molecular weight of the enzyme was estimated to be about 150,000 by sedimentation equilibrium methods. The subunit stoichiometry and molecular weight of the pyruvate dehydrogenase multienzyme complex from Escherichia coli were also studied. From these studies, we can infer that the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex is a large enzyme complex with multiple subunits.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
