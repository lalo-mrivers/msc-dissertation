["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to the provided documents, genetic factors contribute substantially to BMI. The study 'Effects of gender and age on the heritability of body mass index' found that genetic effects accounted for 72% and 68% of total variance in men and non-pregnant women respectively, while 'The genetic and environmental sources of body mass index variability: the Muscatine Ponderosity Family Study' suggested a single recessive locus with a major effect that accounted for almost 35% of the adjusted variation in BMI. Polygenic loci accounted for an additional 42%. Therefore, known SNPs explain less than 1% of the variation in body mass index.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
