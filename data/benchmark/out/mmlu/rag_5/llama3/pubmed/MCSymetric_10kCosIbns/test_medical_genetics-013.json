["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe sickle-cell disease as caused by a specific mutation. In the first document, it is mentioned that S hemoglobin must be diagnosed in every black individual using tests such as Emmel test, in vitro solubility test and electrophoresis. The second document reports two cases of homozygotes for Hb S, which suggests that the disease is caused by a specific mutation. The third document discusses the clinical presentation of sickle-cell disease in the Arabian Peninsula, while the fourth document focuses on blood coagulation and fibrinolysis. None of these documents mention deletions, duplications or insertions as causes of sickle-cell disease. Therefore, it can be inferred that the mutation is a point mutation.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
