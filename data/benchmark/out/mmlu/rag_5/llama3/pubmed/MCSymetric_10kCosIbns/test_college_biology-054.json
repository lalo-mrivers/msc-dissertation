["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The main idea is to understand what promotes linkage disequilibrium. The documents provided give information about the effect of mutation on linkage disequilibrium, the effect of combining alleles into electrophoretic classes on detecting linkage disequilibrium, and inferences about linkage disequilibrium. We can see that factors like mutation, non-random mating (e.g., coadapted gene complexes), and epistasis all contribute to promoting linkage disequilibrium. On the other hand, random mating tends to reduce or eliminate linkage disequilibrium. Therefore, we can conclude that random mating does not promote linkage disequilibrium.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
