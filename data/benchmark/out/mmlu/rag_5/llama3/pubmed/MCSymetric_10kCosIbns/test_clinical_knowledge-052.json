["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The provided documents do not explicitly mention the smallest increments on a mercury or aneroid sphygmomanometer. However, we can look at the study [Calibration and safety of sphygmomanometers in health centers of Murcia] which compares the performance of aneroid and mercury sphygmomanometers. The study notes that 20% of measurements made with wrongly calibrated aneroid sphygmomanometers had a margin of error above +/- 8 mmHg, suggesting that the smallest increments on aneroid instruments might be around this value or higher. Mercury instruments are not mentioned in terms of their smallest increments, but it is noted that mercury instruments set at zero are correctly calibrated and can be used as a model for checking aneroid ones.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: 1 mmHg.\"\n}"]
