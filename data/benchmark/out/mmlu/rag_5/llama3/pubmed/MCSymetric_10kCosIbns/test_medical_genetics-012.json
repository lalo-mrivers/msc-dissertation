["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the recurrence risk for a condition like schizophrenia. The relevant documents mention that there is evidence of genetic transmission of schizophrenia, with studies suggesting an autosomal dominant character with reduced penetrance and variable expressivity.
