["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents mention the study of plasma and cerebrospinal fluid levels of monoamine metabolites in patients with chronic fatigue syndrome. The study found a significant reduction in basal plasma levels of MHPG (3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol) and a significant increase in basal plasma levels of 5-HIAA (5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid). This suggests that alterations in dopamine and serotonin neurotransmitters may be involved in fatigue development. Additionally, the document 'Intense fatigue in humans' mentions psychiatric disorders frequently associated with fatigue, including depression, somatization and anxiety disorders, which may also involve changes in neurotransmitter levels.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: Dopamine and serotonin.\""]
