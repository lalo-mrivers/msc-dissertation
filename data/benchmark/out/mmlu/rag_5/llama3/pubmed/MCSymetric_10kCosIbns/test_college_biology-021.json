["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe demographic parameters such as mean life-expectancy (e) and the Malthusian parameter (r). They also discuss entropy of a population which measures convexity of fertility and mortality distributions. There is no mention of natality and mortality rates being equal to one another, indicating a stable or stationary population. Therefore, it cannot be referred to as a 'population explosion' or 'population crash'. Zero population growth implies that the number of births equals the number of deaths, which aligns with the description provided.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
