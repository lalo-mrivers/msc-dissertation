["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks for the initial energy source for very high force contractions lasting 1-2 seconds. We can look at the provided documents to find an answer. The first document talks about energy conversion and the release of two quanta of electronic excitation, but it does not specifically mention the initial energy source for high-force contractions. The second document discusses myocardial oxygen consumption during isometric contraction and finds a constant linear relationship between tension development and oxygen uptake. It does not provide information on high-force contractions. The third document talks about muscle as a thermodynamic machine and mentions three main problems in the energetics of muscular contraction, but it does not address the specific question. The fourth document discusses kinetic studies of muscular contractions, but it is also silent on the topic. The last document discusses force-load-velocity relations and internal loads of tetanized frog cardiac muscle, which may be relevant to high-force contractions lasting 1-2 seconds. However, it does not specifically address the initial energy source.\n\nWe can look at the documents related to muscle physiology and thermodynamics to find an answer. It seems that phosphocreatine stores are a common source of energy for high-intensity, short-duration contractions.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
