["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The optimality theory as applied to a given trait is best represented by the idea that natural selection tends ideally to maximize inclusive fitness of the individual or some other suitable quantity. The question asks about the optimality theory from an evolutionary perspective, so we should consider the documents provided. One document discusses the optimizing principle of natural selection in evolutionary population genetics, which implies that all gene frequency changes that lead to the same partial increase in mean fitness as the natural selection gene frequency changes minimize a generalized distance measure between parent and daughter generation gene frequency values. This suggests that the optimality theory is about finding an optimal solution among different possibilities, not just maximizing benefits or minimizing costs. Therefore, we should look for options that reflect this idea of optimization.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B: if the trait reaps the best return for the cost relative to alternative forms of the trait, that trait will win out over the alternative forms\""]
