["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the effect of low external pH on mitochondria isolated in a buffered solution. The relevant documents mention that the membrane potential (deltapsi) can be measured by the distribution of 86Rb+ in the presence of valinomycin, and deltapH by the distribution of [14C]acetate. The paper also discusses the relationship between deltalog (ATP/ADP)e/(ATP/ADP)i = deltalogphi and deltapsi. Furthermore, it is mentioned that the ATP-ADP exchange system in rat liver mitochondria is electrogenic, which means that it depends on the membrane potential.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
