["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the location where DNA is transcribed to messenger RNA. Based on the provided documents, we can see that transcription of DNA into pre-mRNA occurs (document 1, point 7). The same document also explains that primary pre-mRNA is processed into secondary pre-mRNA's and eventually functional mRNA (points 8-10). There is no mention of ribosomes, cytosol, or cell division in the context of transcription. Therefore, we can eliminate options A, B, D. Option C, 'in the nucleus', seems to be the most plausible location for transcription.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
