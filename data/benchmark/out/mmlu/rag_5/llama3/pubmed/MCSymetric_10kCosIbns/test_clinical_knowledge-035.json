["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the normal respiratory rate for an adult male. We need to find the relevant information from the provided documents. In the first document, we see that there are mean values of TI (inspiratory duration) mostly lying between 1 and 2-5 sec, which translates to a breathing rate of around 12-20 breaths per minute. However, this is not specific enough to give us a clear answer. The second document provides information on breath rates at resting and increased respiratory rates. It does not provide a specific value for normal adult males. The third document discusses respiration in psychophysiology but does not provide relevant information either. The fourth and fifth documents are about variability of respiratory phases and durations, respectively, but do not give us the normal breathing rate for an adult male. Therefore, we need to look at the last two documents which discuss breath rates as a function of parameters of pulmonary function. In the first document, it is mentioned that the mean 15-17/min in subjects with normal pulmonary function. This suggests that the normal respiratory rate for an adult male could be around 10-12 breaths per minute. However, this value should be verified by comparing it to other sources.\", \"answer_choice\": B}"]
