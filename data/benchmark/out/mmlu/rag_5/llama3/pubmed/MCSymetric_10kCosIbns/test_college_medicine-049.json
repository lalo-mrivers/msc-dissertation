["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, we need to find the molar ratio of ethane to oxygen. From the given reaction, we can see that 1 C2H4 molecule reacts with 3.5 O2 molecules (1:1.75). Since we are given 84g of ethane, we need to convert it to moles first. The molar mass of ethane is 30amu, so the number of moles of ethane is 84g / 30amu = 2.8moles.\n\nNow, we can find the total amount of oxygen required for the reaction:\n\nTotal oxygen molecules needed = Total ethane molecules x (3.5/1) = 2.8moles x 3.5 = 9.8moles\n\nSince the atomic mass of oxygen is 16amu, the total weight of oxygen is:\n\nWeight of oxygen = 9.8moles x 16amu = 156g\n\nFinally, we can use the given stoichiometry to find the weight of carbon dioxide produced: C2H4 + O2 â†’ CO2 + H2O. Since 1 mole of ethane produces 0.3 moles of CO2, and we have 2.8moles of ethane:\n\nWeight of CO2 = 0.3moles/mole x 2.8moles = 0.84moles\n\nThe molar mass of carbon dioxide is 44amu, so the weight of CO2 is:\n\nWeight of CO2 = 0.84moles x 44amu = 37g\",\n\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: 156g\""]
