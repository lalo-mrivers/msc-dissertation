["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the genes that allow host birds to be duped into rearing cuckoo fledglings. The relevant documents mention brood parasitism and how hosts can evolve near-perfect defences against parasites, making it difficult to understand why parasites continue to exist. This study demonstrates costs to host defences, such that once the parasite goes extinct on a particular host species, defence mechanisms are selectively disadvantageous. This suggests that there is no penalty for rearing cuckoo fledglings. Furthermore, the documents do not mention any direct cost of rearing an interloper. Therefore, it can be inferred that the maximum fitness of the duped bird is not compromised when the bird rears an interloper of another species.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
