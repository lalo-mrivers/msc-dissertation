["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the expected phenotypic ratios of the offspring when an affected male with MERRF syndrome reproduces with a normal female. Since MERRF is a maternally inherited disorder caused by a mutation in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), we can infer that only females will be carriers of the mutated mtDNA and transmit it to their offspring. Therefore, half of the daughters will inherit the mutation and express the disease, while all sons will not inherit the mutation as they do not have X chromosomes. This suggests that the expected phenotypic ratios are: all males unaffected, half of the females affected.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
