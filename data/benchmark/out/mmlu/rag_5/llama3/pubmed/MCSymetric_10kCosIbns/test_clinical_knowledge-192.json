["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about products of ADP degradation that increase in concentration during multiple sprint sports. The provided documents reveal the effects of ADP on platelet aggregation, muscle metabolism, and biochemical processes. From these texts, we can infer that ADP inhibits glucose degradation, increases lactate formation, and affects NAD/NADP levels. Additionally, the documents describe changes in muscle fiber types and their energy production capabilities.\n\nConsidering these findings, we can focus on the metabolic pathways involved in sprint sports, which often rely on anaerobic glycolysis for energy production. The products of ADP degradation that increase in concentration during multiple sprint sports are likely to be related to this process.\n\nThe relevant text from [Relationship between glycolysis and pentose cycle intensity and thrombocyte aggregation induced by ADP in man] states: \\\"Content of NAD was decreased simultaneously with an increase in content of NADP; the activity of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase was distinctly increased but the unaltered activity of 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase was observed; content of reduced glutathione was increased 15-fold.\\\" This indicates that ADP degradation leads to an increase in NADP and a decrease in NAD.\n\nCombining this information with our understanding of muscle metabolism during sprint sports, we can deduce that the products of ADP degradation that increase in concentration are likely to be related to anaerobic glycolysis. The key players in this process are lactate, pyruvate, and ammonia.\n\nFrom [Muscle metabolism in track athletes, using 31P magnetic resonance spectroscopy], we know that long-distance runners exhibit greater oxidative capacity compared to sprinters, indicating that their energy production pathways differ.\n\nFinally, considering the biochemical effects of ADP degradation on platelet aggregation and muscle metabolism, we can infer that the products of ADP degradation that increase in concentration are likely to be related to anaerobic glycolysis, lactate formation, and ammonia production.\n\nBased on this step-by-step analysis, we can conclude that the correct answer is B: Ammonia, urea and uric acid.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
