["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the probability of each child being affected when both parents are affected with the same autosomal recessive disorder. Since it's an autosomal recessive disorder, the child will be affected only if they inherit two copies of the recessive allele (one from each parent). The parents are both affected, so they must have inherited two copies of the recessive allele themselves. Therefore, there is a 100% chance that each child will also inherit two copies of the recessive allele and be affected with the disorder.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
