["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant document for this question is 'ATP and phosphocreatine changes in single human muscle fibers after intense electrical stimulation'. In this study, the recovery pattern of adenine nucleotides and glucolytic intermediates after short-lasting anaerobic exercise was studied. Biopsies were obtained from the vastus lateralis muscle at rest, immediately after intermittent electrical stimulation with occluded circulation (total time 166 s), and after 20 s, 60 s, 5 min, and 15 min of recovery.\\n\\nThe study found that phosphocreatine (PCr) content in type I fibers at rest was 72.3 +/- 4.50 mmol/kg dry muscle and 83.3 +/- 9.76 mmol/kg dry muscle in type II fibers. After exercise, PCr was depleted in both fiber types. After the 60 s of recovery the PCr content in type I fibers was significantly higher (P less than 0.05) compared with type II fibers, but, after 5 min of oxidative recovery, the PCr levels were equal in the two fiber types.\\n\\nThe study also found that 15 minutes postexercise, type II fibers demonstrated a significantly higher content (97.8 mmol/kg dry muscle) compared with its resting value (P less than 0.05). This suggests that phosphocreatine resynthesis during recovery from exercise is dependent on the fiber type.\\n\\nBased on this study, the correct answer is not A: an excess of creatine. Hyperventilation and excess oxygen are not relevant to phosphocreatine resynthesis, so options B and C can be ruled out. The most likely explanation for the inhibition of phosphocreatine resynthesis during recovery from exercise is a lack of oxygen (option D), which would affect both type I and type II fibers.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
