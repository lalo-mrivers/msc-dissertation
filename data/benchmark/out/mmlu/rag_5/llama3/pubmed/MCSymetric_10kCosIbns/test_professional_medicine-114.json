["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's father had classic hemophilia, which is an X-linked recessive condition. This means that the mutation responsible for hemophilia is located on the X chromosome. Since the fetus is XY, it will not inherit the X chromosome with the hemophilia mutation from its mother (who would have XX chromosomes). Therefore, the fetus cannot inherit hemophilia. However, the fetus may still be a carrier of the mutation, as it can still inherit an X chromosome with the mutation from its mother. According to Mendelian inheritance, males who are carriers of a recessive X-linked disorder have a 50% chance of passing the mutated X chromosome to each of their daughters and a 0% chance of passing it to their sons.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
