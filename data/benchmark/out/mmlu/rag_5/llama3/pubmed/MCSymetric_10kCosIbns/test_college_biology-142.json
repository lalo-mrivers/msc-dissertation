["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, we are looking for characteristics that are predicted for an early-successional plant community. From the information about phenology, we can infer that environmental factors play a crucial role in determining plant growth and development. The concept of parallel divergence in classification of life forms suggests that plants may exhibit varying traits under different conditions.\n\nConsidering the context, I would hypothesize that early-successional plant communities are likely to be characterized by high niche divergence among co-occurring species, as plants must adapt quickly to changing environmental conditions.\", \n\"answer_choice\": A"]
