["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The cross between a tall violet plant (DDWw) and a dwarf white plant can be represented as DDWw x ddww. Since the allele for tall plants (D) is completely dominant to the allele for dwarf plants (d), all offspring will have the genotype Dw or Dd, which will result in tall plants. Similarly, since the allele for violet flower color (W) is completely dominant to the allele for white flower color (w), all offspring will have the genotype Ww or WW, which will result in violet flowers. Therefore, the expected phenotypic ratio of the progeny would be.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A: All tall violet\""]
