["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking which structure is derived from ectomesenchyme. From the documents, we know that mesoderm gives rise to various tissues including skeletal muscles (Organization and differentiation of the somite mesoderm...). We also know that the mandibular mesoderm in higher vertebrates includes both gastral mesoderm and peristomal mesoderm, and that this is homologous to III and some subsequent segments of Brachiostoma lanceolata. This suggests that skeletal muscles are derived from a region of mesoderm that is anteriorly located. Therefore, we can conclude that skeletal muscles are derived from ectomesenchyme.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
