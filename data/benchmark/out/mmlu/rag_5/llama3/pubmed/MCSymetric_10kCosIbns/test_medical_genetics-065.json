["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents provided discuss the isolation and chromosomal assignment of 100 highly informative human simple sequence repeat (SSR) polymorphisms. These markers have heterozygosities greater than 0.50 and can be amplified using identical PCR conditions. The frequency of SSRs on each chromosome was proportional to the relative chromosomal length, except for chromosome 15, which had a substantial excess of markers identified. This suggests that simple tandem repeat polymorphisms in humans are most useful for genetic mapping and personal identification.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
