["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The reaction that occurs when 10.0 mL of 0.1 M HCl is added to Mg(OH)2 slowly dissolved in 500 mL of 25°C water until the solution becomes fully saturated can be understood by considering the properties of the reactants and products.\n\nFirst, we know that magnesium hydroxide (Mg(OH)2) reacts with hydrochloric acid (HCl) to form magnesium chloride (MgCl2) and water. This reaction is as follows:\n\nMg(OH)2 + 2HCl → MgCl2 + 2H2O\n\nSince the solution becomes fully saturated, we can assume that all the ions are present in solution.\n\nWhen HCl is added to the solution, it will react with the hydroxide ions (OH-) to form water and increase the concentration of hydrogen ions (H+). This reaction is as follows:\n\nOH- + HCl → H2O\n\nSince OH- is a reactant, its concentration will decrease, while the concentration of H2O will increase.\n\nAs the solution becomes more acidic due to the addition of HCl, the solubility of Mg(OH)2 will decrease, and it may precipitate out as Mg(OH)2. This can occur if the product (MgCl2) is less soluble than the reactant (Mg(OH)2).\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that when 10.0 mL of 0.1 M HCl is added to the solution, Mg(OH)2 may precipitate out as a result of the increased acidity.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B: Mg(OH)2 precipitates\"\n}"]
