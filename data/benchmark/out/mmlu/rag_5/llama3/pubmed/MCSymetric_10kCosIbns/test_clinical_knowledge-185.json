["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents discuss chromosome studies in health and disease. The first document mentions karyotypic analysis establishing that genetic imbalances account for one-fifth of spontaneous abortions and birth defects. This implies a normal human chromosome complement. The second document describes the structural element of an eukaryotic chromosome as a DNA-protein complex, which is consistent with previous research. The third document investigates whether homologous chromosomes differ in DNA content and finds that most do not show differences at the current level of resolution. The fourth document discusses new methods of identifying chromosomes, but does not provide information on the number of human chromosomes.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
