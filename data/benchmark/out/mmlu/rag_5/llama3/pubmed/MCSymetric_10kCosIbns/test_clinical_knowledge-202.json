["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to the first document, during near maximal intense exercise, muscle store of ATP will be depleted in &lt; 1s. Additionally, from approximately 75% VO2 max to near maximal workloads, anaerobic utilization of phosphocreatine (PCr) and carbohydrate fuels ATP resynthesis. Therefore, the energy released from the breakdown of high-energy phosphates, ATP and PCr, can sustain maximal exertion exercise for about 1-2 seconds.\",\n\"answer_choice\": A"]
