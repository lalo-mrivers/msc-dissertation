["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for a laboratory finding that would support the hypothesis that stress of studying for examinations adversely affects the immune system. The relevant documents mention medical students' stress levels and its impact on their mental health. The 'Profile of psychiatric and psychosomatic symptoms in medical students' paper discusses how stress associated with examination can lead to a high level of psychopathology. The 'Stress on cardiac activity of students during course and national examinations' paper shows that the greatest stress on cardiac activity was revealed before and after receiving the examination paper as well as during the answer, suggesting increased stress levels during this time. Based on these findings, it is likely that the immune system would be affected during this period. The 'Psychotherapy in anxiety caused by examinations and in learning difficulties' article does not provide specific laboratory findings but discusses how examination neuroses can be treated with psychotherapeutic approaches.\n\nGiven the context of increased stress levels during finals week, the laboratory finding that is most likely to support the hypothesis would be an indication of immune system suppression. This could be reflected in a decrease in certain immune parameters such as macrophage activity (B) or a decrease in cortisol levels (A), which has been linked to immune function.\n\nAn increased basophil count (C) does not directly relate to immune system function and may not support the hypothesis. An increased lymphocyte count (D) could potentially support the hypothesis, but it would be more consistent with an immune response rather than a direct effect of stress on the immune system.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
