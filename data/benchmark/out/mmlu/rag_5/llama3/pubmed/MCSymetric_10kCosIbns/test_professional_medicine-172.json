["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The couple has a family history of Î±-thalassemia. The woman has a minimally decreased hemoglobin concentration and a single gene deletion. The man has microcytic anemia and a two-gene deletion. This indicates that the woman is a carrier, likely for alpha-thalassemia-1. The man's two-gene deletion suggests that he is homozygous for this condition. When they have offspring, if both parents are carriers of alpha-thalassemia-1, and the father is homozygous for the two-gene deletion, then their offspring will be affected only if they inherit one deletion from each parent. This is because the father's genotype is already a deletion on both genes, so the child needs to inherit another deletion from the mother to have the condition. The probability of this happening is 25%.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
