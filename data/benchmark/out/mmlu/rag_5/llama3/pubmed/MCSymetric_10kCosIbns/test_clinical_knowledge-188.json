["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the rate limiting enzyme of glycolysis. The relevant documents provide information on the mathematical modeling of glycolysis, including the Embden--Meyerhof pathway and the role of ATP-synthesis and -consumption. The documents do not directly mention the rate limiting enzyme, but they do describe the inhibition of phosphofructokinase by ATP and the strong inhibition of hexokinase by glucose-6-phosphate. This suggests that both phosphofructokinase and hexokinase may play important roles in regulating the rate of glycolysis. However, the documents do not provide enough information to determine which enzyme is specifically rate limiting.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: phosphofructokinase\""]
