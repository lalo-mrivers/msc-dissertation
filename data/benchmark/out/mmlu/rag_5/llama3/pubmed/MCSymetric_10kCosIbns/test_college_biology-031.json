["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the typical characteristics of normal somatic cells in a human male. We know that somatic cells are diploid, meaning they have two sets of chromosomes (23 pairs). The zygote's genetic information is passed on to all daughter cells, including somatic cells. Inactivated X chromosome refers to Lyonization, where one X chromosome is inactivated in each somatcell. Autosomes refer to the non-sex chromosomes, and a diploid nucleus means the cell has two complete sets of chromosomes. So, we need to identify which option does not describe normal human male somatic cells.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
