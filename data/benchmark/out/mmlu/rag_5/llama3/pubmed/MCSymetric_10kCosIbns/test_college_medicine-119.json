["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the structure and composition of various biological molecules, including proteins, DNA, and nucleotides. The first document describes sublicons containing amino acids and nucleotides, which are threadlike structures that form during sublimation. The second document discusses species-specific aggregation factors in sponges and describes the structure of a large circular proteid particle from Geodia cydonium. The third document investigates the B to Z transition of poly[d(AC).d(GT)] DNA under dehydrating conditions, requiring multivalent ions for the transition. Finally, the fourth document reports on polymorphism in chenodeoxycholic acid.\n\nFrom these documents, it is clear that codons are not composed of quadruplet sequences of nucleotide bases (choice B), nor triplet sequences of amino acids (choice C) or deoxyribose sugars (choice D). Instead, codons are composed of triplet sequences of nucleotide bases in mRNA or DNA (choice A). This is because the structure and function of biological molecules described in these documents rely on the sequence-specific interactions between nucleotides.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
