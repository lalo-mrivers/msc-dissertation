["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the free energy contained in FADH2 and NADH+H. Both coenzymes are involved in redox reactions. FADH2 is a reduced form of flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) while NADH+H is a reduced form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD). The free energy contained in these coenzymes is used to drive various biochemical reactions, including the synthesis of ATP. Based on the mechanism of action of these enzymes, it can be inferred that the free energy from FADH2 and NADH+H can rephosphorylate a certain number of ATP molecules.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C\n}"]
