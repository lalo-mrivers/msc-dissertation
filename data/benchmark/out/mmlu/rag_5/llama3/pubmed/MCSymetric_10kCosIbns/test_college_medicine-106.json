["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the products of ADP degradation that increase in concentration in the blood during multiple sprint sports. From the provided documents, we can see that ADP inhibits glycolysis and increases the rate of lactate formation. This suggests that the intensity of anaerobic breakdown of carbohydrates is increased. Additionally, the content of NAD was decreased with an increase in content of NADP; the activity of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase was distinctly increased but the unaltered activity of 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase was observed. This indicates that there is an increased demand for anaerobic energy production, which is consistent with the multiple sprint sports scenario.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A: Ammonia, hypoxanthine and uric acid.\""]
