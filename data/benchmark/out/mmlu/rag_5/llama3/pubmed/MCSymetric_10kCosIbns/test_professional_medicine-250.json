["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is receiving morphine via a patient-controlled pump for postoperative pain management. She has no history of substance use disorder, but is worried about becoming addicted. The relevant information from the provided documents suggests that intravenous morphine can be an effective method of controlling postoperative pain. However, the concern about addiction is reasonable. The studies on oral morphine and patient-controlled i.v. analgesia suggest a relatively low risk of side effects, including addiction. Additionally, the study on intrathecal morphine for postoperative pain found that doses below 0.1 mg were safe and effective. Furthermore, the report on postoperative epidural morphine highlights its safety profile when used outside of intensive care units. Given these findings, it is reasonable to reassess the patient's needs and consider alternative options if necessary.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
