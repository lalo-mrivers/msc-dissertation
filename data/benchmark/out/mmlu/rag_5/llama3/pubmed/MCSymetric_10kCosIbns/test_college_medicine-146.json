["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the time frame for which the ATP store in muscle can supply energy in high intensity exercise. According to the abstract of the first document, 'the muscle ATP stores cannot provide more than 1 or 2 kcal of muscular work.' Since ATP is the sole fuel for muscle contraction and during near maximal intense exercise the muscle store of ATP will be depleted in < 1s, it can be inferred that the time frame for which the ATP store in muscle can supply energy is less than 1 second. This is further supported by the fact that anaerobic glycolysis provided approximately 80%, phosphocreatine (PCr) degradation approximately 16%, and depletion of the ATP store approximately 4% of the total ATP provided.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B: 2 seconds.\""]
