["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the documents provided, we can see that G6PD deficiency is prevalent among males. In the document 'The molecular basis of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency', it is mentioned that an estimated 400 million people throughout the world are deficient in G6PD; numerous lines of evidence indicate that this is because female heterozygotes have a selective advantage in malaria infections. This suggests that G6PD deficiency is more common among males, which is consistent with X-linked recessive inheritance. Furthermore, in the document 'Molecular heterogeneity underlying the G6PD Mediterranean phenotype', it is mentioned that male offspring inherit G6PD deficiency from their carrier mothers. This further supports the idea of X-linked recessive inheritance.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
