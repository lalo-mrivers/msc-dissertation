["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the biomechanics of the normal and prosthetic knee document, it can be seen that the knee joint is characterized by particular kinetics due to asymmetry of the femoral condyles and to angulation of the extensor system. This suggests that the knee joint is not a ball and socket joint, but rather has a unique mechanism of movement. Additionally, the menisco-ligamentous system plays a crucial role in the stability of the knee joint.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A: The knee is a ball and socket joint\""]
