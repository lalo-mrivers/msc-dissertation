["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the structure and composition of various biological molecules such as sublicons, proteid particles, and nucleic acids. The information provided does not specifically mention codons or their composition. However, we can infer that codons are sequences of nucleotide bases based on the context. In molecular biology, codons refer to the triplet sequences of nucleotide bases in mRNA that code for amino acid sequences.\",\n\"answer_choice\": A\n}"]
