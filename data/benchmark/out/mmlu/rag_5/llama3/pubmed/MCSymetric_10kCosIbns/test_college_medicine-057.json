["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about a substance that binds to cytochrome oxidase A3, the final enzyme in the electron transport chain. This means that it likely affects oxygen reduction and aerobic respiration. In functional intermediates in reaction of cytochrome oxidase with oxygen, compounds of Type C are formed from ferricyanide-pretreated oxidase and may involve higher oxidation states of the heme iron such as quadrivalent iron. Kinetic and equilibrium studies show these compounds to be functional in oxygen reduction. Since this substance binds to A3, it is likely that it affects these Type C compounds and their role in oxygen reduction. As a result, cells would not be able to pass electrons to oxygen, stopping aerobic respiration and asphyxiating the cells.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
