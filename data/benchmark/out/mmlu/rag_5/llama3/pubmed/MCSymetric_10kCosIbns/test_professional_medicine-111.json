["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 40-year-old female secretary with a 2-month history of fatigue, generalized aching and weakness of the proximal muscles of all four extremities. The symptoms began with difficulty getting in and out of her car, but have progressed to affect daily activities such as combing her hair. She also has aching of the joints in her hands that responds partially to ibuprofen. Physical examination reveals cracking of the skin on both hands, tender muscles in the upper arms and legs, and laboratory tests show elevated creatine kinase and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\nThe patient's symptoms are consistent with polymyositis, an autoimmune disorder characterized by muscle inflammation and weakness. The laboratory test results support this diagnosis, as elevated creatine kinase and lactate dehydrogenase levels are common in patients with polymyositis. Furthermore, the patient's age and lack of family history also suggest polymyositis, which is more common among women over 40 years old.\n\nThe other options, fibromyalgia, myasthenia gravis, and scleroderma, do not fit the patient's symptoms as well. Fibromyalgia is characterized by widespread musculoskeletal pain, but does not typically involve muscle weakness or inflammation. Myasthenia gravis is a neuromuscular disorder that affects the muscles of voluntary movement, but the patient's symptoms are more consistent with polymyositis. Scleroderma is a connective tissue disorder that can cause skin thickening and joint pain, but does not typically involve muscle weakness or inflammation.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the patient's symptoms, laboratory test results, and physical examination, the most likely diagnosis is polymyositis.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
