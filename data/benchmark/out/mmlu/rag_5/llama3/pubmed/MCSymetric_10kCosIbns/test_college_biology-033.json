["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about characteristics typical of r-selected species. R-selected species are characterized by a high reproductive rate, which allows them to rapidly colonize new environments. The document 'Mammals, resources and reproductive strategies' discusses the breeding systems of mammalian species being strongly influenced by the density and dispersion of their populations, which is also related to resource distribution. This suggests that the characteristics mentioned in the question are related to the reproduction rate and population dynamics. However, there is no mention of competitive ability or body size in this document.\n\nThe documents on carnivorous plants and nematodes do not seem directly relevant to the concept of r-selected species. The haematologic parameters of birds of prey also do not provide information about reproductive rates or population dynamics.\n\nBased on the provided documents, it appears that high competitive ability is not a typical characteristic of r-selected species.\", \n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
