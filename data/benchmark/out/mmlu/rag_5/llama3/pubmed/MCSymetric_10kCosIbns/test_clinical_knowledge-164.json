["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to the documents, the accuracy and reproducibility of peak flow meters are important considerations. The American Thoracic Society's spirometer testing set was used to drive a computer-controlled syringe in the evaluation of accuracy and reproducibility of peak flowmeters at 1,400 m. This suggests that a certain level of consistency is desired when recording peak flow results.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
