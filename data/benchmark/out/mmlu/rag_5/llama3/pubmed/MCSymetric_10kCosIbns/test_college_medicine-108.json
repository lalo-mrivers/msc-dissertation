["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about a fundamental cause of fatigue in high intensity exercise. We need to analyze the provided documents to find relevant information. The first document talks about general fatigue and its effect on isometric strength-endurance measurements, but it does not provide any insight into the causes of fatigue. The second document discusses electromyographic changes during an all-out anaerobic capacity test and suggests that central fatigue may occur. However, it does not address the fundamental cause of fatigue. The third document provides a review of factors influencing prolonged intensive exercise, including aerobic metabolism, but does not explicitly discuss the fundamental cause of fatigue in high intensity exercise. The fourth document investigates respiratory muscle fatigue during moderate endurance run and concludes that respiratory muscle fatigue does not limit exercise performance. Finally, the fifth document discusses exercises without cardiovascular or respiratory stress, which is not relevant to the question.\n\nThe key information we need to answer this question is found in the second document, specifically the electromyographic changes during an all-out anaerobic capacity test. This suggests that central fatigue may occur during high intensity exercise. Therefore, we can infer that the fundamental cause of fatigue in high intensity exercise is likely related to the inability of ATP supply to match demand (option C).\",\n\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
