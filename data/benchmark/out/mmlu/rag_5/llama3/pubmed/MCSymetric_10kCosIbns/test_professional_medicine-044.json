["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has a recent injury to the right arm with pain and swelling. The examination shows edema around a fluctuant erythematous lesion at the site of trauma, which is tender to palpation. This suggests that there may be an inflammatory response occurring.

The document 'The swollen limb: cutaneous clues to diagnosis and treatment' suggests that careful attention to cutaneous signs may be helpful in determining an accurate diagnosis and appropriate therapy.
