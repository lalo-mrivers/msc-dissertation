["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the effects of increasing substrate concentration on noncompetitive inhibition. From the given documents, we know that noncompetitive inhibitors bind to an allosteric site on the enzyme and prevent it from catalyzing a reaction. Therefore, increasing the substrate concentration would not affect the binding of the noncompetitive inhibitor. On the other hand, uncompetitive inhibitors bind to the enzyme-substrate complex and prevent catalysis. Increasing the substrate concentration would increase the formation of this complex, which would enhance the impact of the uncompetitive inhibitor.\", \"answer_choice\": B}"]
