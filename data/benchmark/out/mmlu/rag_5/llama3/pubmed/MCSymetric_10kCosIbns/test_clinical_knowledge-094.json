["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, we can consider the scenarios where patients are cyanosed. In 'Management of chemical cyanosis by oxygen saturation readings', it is mentioned that oxygen saturation may be determined easily and rapidly by the reflection oximeter method, and may be used safely as a guide to treatment of chemical cyanosis. No changes would have been made in medical management of any of the patients if the decisions had been made on the basis of the oxygen saturation level of less than 90% rather than the methemoglobin percentage of 10% or more. This suggests that oxygen saturation levels below 90% might be associated with cyanosis.\n\nIn 'The infant with cyanosis in the emergency room', it is mentioned that cyanosis can have diverse causes and a thorough history and physical examination will guide the physician toward appropriate intervention and management. This implies that oxygen saturation levels may vary depending on the underlying cause of cyanosis.\n\nIn 'Extended monitoring of oxygen saturation in chronic lung disease', it is mentioned that prolonged monitoring of SpO2 will disclose the presence of hypoxemia, which can be a cause of cyanosis. The mean SpO2 values were significantly lower when supplemental oxygen therapy was not in use, suggesting that oxygen saturation levels below 88% might be associated with cyanosis.\n\nConsidering these scenarios and findings, we can conclude that patients who are cyanosed may have oxygen saturation levels below 90%, possibly even as low as 80% or below. Therefore, the correct answer is C: 80% or below.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
