["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the volume of the gas at 1 atm, we can use the ideal gas law PV = nRT. Given that the initial volume is 0.1L and pressure is 200atm, we can rearrange the equation to solve for P: P = nRT/V. Since we are interested in finding the volume at 1 atm, we need to find the corresponding volume that corresponds to this pressure. By rearranging the equation again, we get V = nRT/P. We know R is approximately 0.082057 L·atm/mol·K and T is the temperature in Kelvin (assuming it's the same as initial conditions). Therefore, we can calculate the volume at 1 atm.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
