["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the evolution of canine dimorphism in anthropoid primates, with multiple factors proposed as influences. Intrasexual competition has been questioned due to mating system variation, but Kay et al. (1988) demonstrated that a refined estimate of intermale competition explains a large proportion of the variation in canine dimorphism. The provided documents also discuss copulatory patterns in male primates and the role of attractiveness and mate selection in phylogenetic adaptation.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B\n}"]
