["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about observing proteins moving along the plasma membrane. The relevant document is 'Spatial organization at the cell surface' which discusses approaches to analyzing spatial organization of cell surface structure. It mentions that extraction of cells with nonionic and ionic detergents, chelating and chaotropic agents, salts, and reducing agents results in selective solubilization of surface proteins. Bisimidate disulfide-containing crosslinking reagents produce complexes containing surface proteins which can be analyzed by subsequent dissociation of the complexes. The document also talks about immunofluorescent staining of cells with antisera to LETS protein and to actin reveals fibrillar structures which survive NP40 extraction. None of these methods involve inserting a tumor-inducing virus, isolating an immortal variant cell from culture or creating a cell line. Producing a heterokaryon or hybrid cell would allow for the observation of proteins integrating along a fused mouse-human cell plasma membrane.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
