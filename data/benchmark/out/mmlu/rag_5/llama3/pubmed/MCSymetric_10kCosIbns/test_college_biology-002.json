["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the embryos of terrestrial vertebrates. The relevant documents mention amphibian embryos, but not terrestrial vertebrate embryos. However, one can assume that the concept applies to both amphibians and terrestrial vertebrates. The document 'Mechanical stresses and morphological patterns in amphibian embryos' talks about the fluids surrounding the embryos. It does not specify which fluid it is referring to. The other documents are unrelated to this question. Therefore, we need to rely on general knowledge of embryonic development. Terrestrial vertebrate embryos are protected by a fluid called amniotic fluid, which is secreted by the amnion.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
