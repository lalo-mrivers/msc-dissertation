["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the provided documents, I understand that facial profile analysis involves studying various parameters such as total facial convexity, upper lip to esthetic plane, and lower lip length. The document 'Analysis of soft tissue facial profile in white males' presents a table of means, standard deviations, and ranges for these variables. A 'dished face' profile is characterized by a concave shape, which can be observed in children compared to adults. This is evident from the sagittal proportions relating nasal depth/nose to most protrusive lip/chin to most protrusive lip, which show a ratio of 2.1:1.0:1.2 in children and 1.8:1.0:0.3 in adults. Therefore, option C, an enlarged frontal bone due to hydrocephaly, does not fit the description of a 'dished face' profile.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
