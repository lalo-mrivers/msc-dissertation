["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 17-year-old girl who has not had a menstrual period for 6 months. Menarche occurred at the age of 12 years, and menses had occurred at regular 28-day intervals until they became irregular 1 year ago. She appears emaciated with a BMI of 15 kg/m2, pulse of 54/min, and blood pressure of 80/50 mm Hg. Based on the information provided, amenorrhea is likely due to a functional problem along the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis. The patient's history of regular menstrual cycles until they became irregular 1 year ago suggests that the issue may be related to nutritional or psychogenic factors rather than organic pathology. Given her emaciated appearance and low BMI, it is likely that her amenorrhea is related to nutritional factors.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
