["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The provided documents discuss various aspects of muscle physiology, including contraction, relaxation, and electrical stimulation. Based on the information about smooth muscles, it is clear that relaxation can occur without the removal of the nerve stimulus (A) as stress relaxation has a different time course than relaxation after contraction. There is no indication in the documents that the nerve stimulus needs to be too forceful (B) or that actin binding sites need to be uncovered or saturated (C/D). Therefore, the correct answer is A: the nerve stimulus is removed.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
