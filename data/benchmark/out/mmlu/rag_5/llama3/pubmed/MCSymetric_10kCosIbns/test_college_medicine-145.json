["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The article discusses the two primary fates of lactate in skeletal muscle: (1) oxidation and (2) glycogen synthesis. The question asks about the main fate of lactate that leaves muscle and enters the circulation, implying it's referring to lactate that is released into the blood rather than being utilized by the muscle. In the 'Glyconeogenic and oxidative lactate utilization in skeletal muscle' article, it's mentioned that oxidation of lactate is quantitatively the most important means of disposing of lactate, whether in exercising or nonexercising muscle. This suggests that the main fate of lactate that leaves muscle and enters the circulation is likely to be its oxidation by other tissues.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
