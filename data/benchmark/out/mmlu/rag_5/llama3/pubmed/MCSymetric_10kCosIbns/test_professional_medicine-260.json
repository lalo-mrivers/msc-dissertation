["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 10-year-old boy who has had three severe bee sting reactions over the past year. Each reaction has been more severe than the previous one. He developed hives, hoarseness, and light-headedness within 15 minutes of being stung and the symptoms lasted for about an hour before resolving. This suggests that he is at risk for anaphylaxis. The fact that his reactions have become increasingly severe over time also supports this diagnosis.\n\nTherefore, to prevent future morbidity and mortality from this condition, it is important to provide the patient with self-injectable epinephrine as a means of emergency treatment in case of another reaction.\n\nThis recommendation is supported by the document 'Bee-sting anaphylaxis in childhood' which suggests that desensitization is required in such cases and that parents should be trained in the emergency use of adrenaline. The document also recommends keeping adrenaline at home for emergency use.\n\nThe other options do not directly address the patient's risk of anaphylaxis or provide a means of emergency treatment.\", \"answer_choice\": D}"]
