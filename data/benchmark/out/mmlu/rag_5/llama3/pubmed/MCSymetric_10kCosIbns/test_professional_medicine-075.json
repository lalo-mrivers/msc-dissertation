["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has systemic sclerosis (scleroderma) with symptoms of progressive shortness of breath and nonproductive cough. The pulmonary function tests show total lung capacity is 80% of predicted, and diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide, corrected for alveolar volume, is 65% of predicted. This suggests that the patient has interstitial lung disease (ILD). The histologic examination of a lung biopsy specimen in ILD often shows patchy lymphocyte and plasma cell infiltration of the alveolar walls, interstitial fibrosis, and increased macrophages but only occasional polymorphonuclear cells and lymphocytes in the alveolar spaces. Alveolitis was not observed without fibrosis. Therefore, based on the symptoms and pulmonary function tests, it is most likely that the histologic examination of a lung biopsy specimen will show diffuse interstitial fibrosis.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
