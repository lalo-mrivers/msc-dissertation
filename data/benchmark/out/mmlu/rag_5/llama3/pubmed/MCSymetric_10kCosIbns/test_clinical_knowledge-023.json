["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about informal carers as of 2020. Since the provided documents are from the late 1980s to early 1990s, we need to look for information that can be applied to 2020. The only relevant document mentioning informal carers is 'Experiences of informal carers providing nursing support for disabled dependants.' This paper provides an account of a group of informal carers who provided nursing support for their physically disabled dependants. It does not provide specific statistics about the number of informal carers or their demographic characteristics.\n\nHowever, we can infer from this document that informal carers are providing a significant amount of care, with some even performing technical procedures. This suggests that informal carers play an important role in supporting individuals with disabilities.\n\nSince there is no direct information available on the prevalence of informal carers among over 65s or their physical fitness levels, we cannot make specific statements about these demographics. Therefore, we need to rely on general knowledge and current statistics about informal carers.\n\nAccording to a report by Carers UK (2020), one in six people aged 55-64 are providing care for someone else. This suggests that there may be an even higher proportion of informal carers among those over 65.\n\nBased on this information, we can infer that option B: One in six over 65s is providing some form of informal care is the most plausible answer.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
