["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the effects of endurance training on muscle capacity. In the provided documents, endurance training is associated with increased aerobic energy metabolism, as seen by increases in enzyme activities such as succinate dehydrogenase, citrate synthase, and beta-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase (Skeletal Muscle Adaptations to Endurance Training). This suggests that endurance training increases the muscle's capacity to generate energy aerobically. There is no evidence of increased anaerobic energy generation or phosphocreatine breakdown.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
