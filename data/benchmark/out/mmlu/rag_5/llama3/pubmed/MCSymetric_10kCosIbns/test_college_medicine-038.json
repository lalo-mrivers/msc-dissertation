["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the process of muscle contraction that requires ATP, aside from the power stroke. We can look at the relevant documents to find this information. The 'Rapid regeneration of the actin-myosin power stroke in contracting muscle' document mentions that the energy for work done by a single crossbridge during a cycle of attachment, generation of force, shortening and detachment is believed to be coupled to the hydrolysis of one molecule of ATP. This suggests that ATP hydrolysis is not only involved in the power stroke but also in the process of muscle contraction.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: Myosin-actin detachment\"\n}"]
