["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the creation of a frameshift mutation. In the provided documents, we can see that frameshifting occurs when there are insertions or deletions (indels) within a run of repeated bases, such as in the his4-38 region of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This was observed to occur through -1 base deletions and +2 base insertions. Similarly, in the detection of mutations in human DNA, point mutational spectra were studied using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis, which indicated that hot-spot point mutations occurred within runs of repeated bases.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
