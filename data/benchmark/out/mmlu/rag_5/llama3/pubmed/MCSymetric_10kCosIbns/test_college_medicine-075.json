["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about Selective Androgen Receptor Modulators (SARMs). Based on the provided documents, it can be inferred that SARMs are non-steroid drugs. This is because the first document mentions the need for 'at least one more specific nuclear receptor' and at least one membrane receptor to account for the rapid effects of androgens. This suggests that a single androgen receptor will not fill the bill, implying that non-steroid compounds are needed to modulate androgen receptors.\n\nThe second document shows that recombinant androgen receptor (AR) was analyzed in transfected COS cells, indicating that these studies were done using in vitro experiments with recombinant AR. This also suggests that non-steroid drugs were used.\n\nThe third document talks about progestin and androgen receptor binding using the CoMFA technique, which is a computational method for analyzing the binding affinity of steroids to receptors. This does not provide any information about SARMs being steroid or non-steroid.\n\nThe fourth document discusses sulfonyl heterocycles as antiandrogens, indicating that these compounds antagonize the effects of natural steroid hormones. However, this does not directly address SARMs or whether they are steroid or non-steroid.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the provided documents, it can be inferred that Selective Androgen Receptor Modulators (SARMs) are likely to be non-steroid drugs.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
