["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The protein is synthesized on cytoplasmic ribosomes, which means it starts in the cytoplasm. Since it's a chloroplast-specific protein, it needs to be translocated into the chloroplast. The process of post-translational insertion of a thylakoid membrane protein requires three membrane-spanning alpha-helices. This suggests that the protein will cross at least two membranes (the envelope and the stroma-free thylakoid) before reaching its final location in the thylakoid lumen. Therefore, the answer is B: Two.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
