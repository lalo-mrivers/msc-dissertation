["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks which nucleotide base is not found in RNA. We can analyze the given documents to find the answer. The first document discusses the conformational features of non-Watson-Crick base pairs in RNA duplex, and it mentions U.G-U.C-C.U-G.U as a specific example of a double helix formed by RNA. This suggests that uracil is present in RNA. Similarly, the other documents discuss the characteristics of mammalian messenger RNAs and provide examples of RNA sequences, without mentioning any absence of uracil or guanine. Therefore, it can be inferred that adenine, guanine, and uracil are all present in RNA.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
