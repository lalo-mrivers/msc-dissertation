["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the descending loop of Henle's loop. From the provided documents, we can infer that the ascending thin limb of Henle's loop has specific transport properties which function to dilute the urine without any movement of water across the epithelium. This suggests that the descending loop of Henle's loop might have different properties. In the [Model of the function of the nephron] document, it is mentioned that active transportation of sodium in the loop of Henle being limited to the thick ascending limb. There is no mention of the descending loop. Therefore, we can safely assume that the descending loop of Henle's loop does not have any specific transport properties that would suggest permeability to any of the given substances.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
