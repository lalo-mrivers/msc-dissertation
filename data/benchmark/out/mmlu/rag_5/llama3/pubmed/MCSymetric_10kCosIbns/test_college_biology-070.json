["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the class of antibodies with epsilon heavy chains, which are found on the plasma membranes of mast cells and basophilic leukocytes. The relevant documents mention IgE receptors on rat mast cells and rat basophilic leukemia cells. Moreover, one report describes an absorbed antiserum capable of inhibiting the binding of IgE to mast cells. Additionally, synthetic peptides comprising sequences of the human immunoglobulin E heavy chain are able to release histamine. Finally, the document about the Fc epsilon receptor mentions that crosslinking this receptor by multivalent antigen results in redistribution of the membrane component recognized by G63, which is also associated with the stimulation of mast cells. All these findings suggest that the correct answer is IgE.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
