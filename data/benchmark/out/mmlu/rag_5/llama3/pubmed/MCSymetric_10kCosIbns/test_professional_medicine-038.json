["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about maintaining serum glucose concentration after a meal. Since the man slept through the night without additional food or drink, we need to consider what happens during fasting state. According to the provided documents, there are circadian variations in basal glucose levels and glucose tolerance (Influence of oral glucose load upon blood glucose level in relation to the time of day). During fasting state, endogenous glucose production is suppressed (Glucose metabolism in man: responses to intravenous glucose infusion). This suggests that glucose release from skeletal muscle (B) is not likely involved in maintaining serum glucose concentration. Additionally, glycogenolysis in the liver (C) may also be unlikely as it would require a significant increase in cortisol and glucagon levels which are typically seen during stress or fasting state. Therefore, we need to consider other mechanisms. The man's serum glucose concentration remains within the reference range, suggesting that there is no significant decrease in glucose levels. This implies that continued gut absorption of calories from the ingested meal (A) may be involved in maintaining his serum glucose concentration.\",\n\"answer_choice\": A"]
