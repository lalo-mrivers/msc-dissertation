["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the mechanism of palatine shelf elevation. The relevant documents describe changes in cell shape and orientation during shelf elevation, the role of mesenchyme in fusion of palatine shelves, developmental aspects of secondary palate formation, elevation of lesioned palatal shelves in vitro, and palatal shelf elevation in Wistar rat fetus. After reviewing these documents, it is clear that turgor pressure due to hydrophilic molecules increasing in the palatine shelves is the intrinsic force which elevates the shelves.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
