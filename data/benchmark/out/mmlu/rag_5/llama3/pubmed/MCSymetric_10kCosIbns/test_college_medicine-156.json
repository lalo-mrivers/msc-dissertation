["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents talk about genes, DNA sequences, coding potential, and various codes for specific molecular interactions or processes. The human genome project mentions genes providing the blueprint for amino acid sequence of structural or functional proteins. The code domains in tandem repetitive DNA sequence structures discusses various DNA codes that are genetically instructive for specific molecular interactions or processes. Numerical classification of coding sequences talks about abbreviating a complete reading frame by its base count or with the corresponding codon table. Stable genes proposes that multiple copies of genes, such as those for histones and RNAs, can conserve their sequence by comparing the copies and eliminating errors. Speculations on the evolution of the genetic code discuss the expansion of the code to include more amino acids. Based on this information, it is clear that the coding sequences of genes refer to the DNA sequences that provide the blueprint for amino acid sequence of structural or functional proteins.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
