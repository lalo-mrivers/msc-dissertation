["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for the absolute threshold of hearing the bell. The provided data shows that as the power level decreases, fewer mice press the lever. This suggests a inverse relationship between power level and hearing ability. By comparing the number of mice pressing the lever at different power levels (20 at 80%, 15 at 70%, 10 at 60%), we can infer that the absolute threshold is reached when the power level is reduced further, resulting in fewer than 10 mice pressing the lever.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: Not enough information given.\""]
