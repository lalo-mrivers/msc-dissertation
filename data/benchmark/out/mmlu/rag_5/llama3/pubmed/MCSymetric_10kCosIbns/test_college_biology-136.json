["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"In this problem, we are given the phenotypes of the parent fruit flies. The female has a gray body and normal wings, while the male has a black body and vestigial wings. We need to explain why some of the progeny have gray bodies but vestigial wings. Since the genes that produce these traits are linked, we can't rely on independent assortment or segregation of alleles to explain this combination. Therefore, we need to consider crossing over as an option. The only way for a fly to inherit the gray body and vestigial wing trait is if there was recombination between the linked genes during meiosis.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
