["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about a 67-year-old man with a blocked catheter after transurethral resection of prostate with irrigation. We can rule out Solution G as it was associated with higher red cell deposits in the urine and uric acid crystals appeared with this solution. Additionally, there is no mention of any specific complications related to the patient's age or post-operative state that would suggest using a different solution. Considering the options, we are left with A (Solution R), B (Normal saline) or D (Any of the above). The only information available from the provided documents about Solution R is that it was one of the three solutions used in a study on bladder washouts and that uric acid crystals appeared with this solution. However, there is no specific mention of complications related to catheter blockage after transurethral resection of prostate. Therefore, we can't conclude that Solution R would be more effective or safer for the patient's condition.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
