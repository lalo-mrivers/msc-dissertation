["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the stage of meiosis when recombination occurs. The documents provided discuss genetic control of meiotic recombination, including the process of crossing over. In yeast, single-strand scissions in DNA accumulate during commitment to genetic recombination at meiosis. There is no mention of metaphase or prophase stages specifically related to recombination. Therefore, it is likely that recombination occurs during Prophase I.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
