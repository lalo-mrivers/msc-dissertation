["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the pattern of inheritance associated with consanguinity. Consanguinity refers to the practice of marrying a relative, which can increase the chances of passing on recessive alleles from both parents. This suggests that the pattern of inheritance related to consanguinity is likely to be autosomal recessive. Additionally, the provided documents discuss vertical transmission and non-Mendelian inheritance, which are relevant to consanguinity and the potential for recessive alleles to be passed down from both parents.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
