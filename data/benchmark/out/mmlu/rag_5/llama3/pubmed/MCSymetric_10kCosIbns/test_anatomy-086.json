["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the provided documents, we can infer that the maxilla growth pattern is influenced by various factors. In prenatal development, the primary growth centers demarcate the maxillary trapezoid and are active until 20 weeks of gestation. Thereafter, intramembranous bone formation along the periphery enhances maxilla growth. Postnatally, teeth loss can lead to reabsorption of bones, affecting morphometric characteristics of the maxilla. However, advancing age without tooth loss does not significantly influence these characteristics.\n\nConsidering the question's focus on postnatal growth, we should examine the provided options. None of the options directly address postnatal growth, but they relate to various aspects of maxilla development and morphology.\n\nBy analyzing the provided documents, we can conclude that:\n\n* Pneumatisation by enlargement of the developing maxillary sinus does not cease at puberty.\n* The maxillary tuberosity is not specifically mentioned in the context of permanent molar eruption. Instead, the text suggests that intramembranous bone formation along the periphery enhances maxilla growth.\n\nThis leaves us with options C and D to consider:\n\n* The zygomaticomaxillary sutures are not directly related to height and length increase in the maxilla.\n* The intermaxillary suture is not mentioned in the provided documents as closing at any specific age postnatally.\n\nBased on this analysis, option A appears to be the correct statement about postnatal growth of the maxilla.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
