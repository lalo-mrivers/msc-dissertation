["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about an unfavourable fracture of the body of the mandible. The main muscles involved in movement of the mandible are the digastric, lateral pterygoid and medial pterygoid muscles. The digastric muscle moves the mandible downwards, while the lateral pterygoid and medial pterygoid muscles move it upwards and backwards respectively. Since the fracture is unfavourable, we would expect one of these muscles to displace a fragment away from its normal position.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
