["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about loss of somatic sensation over the anterior two-thirds of the tongue. The provided documents describe the anatomy and innervation of the tongue. We can start by considering the cervical spinal way of afferent innervation of the tongue motor apparatus, which suggests that the tongue receives afferent innervation from neurons located homolaterally in spinal ganglia C2 and C3. This implies that the anterior two-thirds of the tongue may be innervated by these ganglia. The blood circulation of the tongue article mentions the lingual papillae receiving a rich vascular supply, which is also true for the taste buds. However, this does not directly relate to somatic sensation.\n\nMoving on to the case report [A case of post-traumatic ischemic necrosis of the tongue], it describes a loss of more than half of the tongue due to post-traumatic ischemic necrosis, but it does not specifically mention damage to specific nerves or ganglia. The article on lipoma of the tongue presents a case where the functions of the tongue adapt despite the presence of a massive tumor, implying that the tongue is capable of compensation.\n\nFinally, we have [The natural progress of atherosclerosis of the lateral vessels of the tongue (author's transl)], which discusses the progression of atherosclerosis in the lateral vessels of the tongue and its relation to age-related changes. While this article does not directly address somatic sensation loss, it provides insight into the vascular system of the tongue.\n\nConsidering these documents, we can eliminate options B and C as they are related to taste and hearing respectively, rather than somatic sensation of the tongue.\n\nOption D, hypoglossal nerve, is also unlikely as it primarily innervates the tongue motor apparatus rather than sensory receptors. Option A, lingual branch of the mandibular trigeminal nerve, could potentially be involved in somatic sensation loss but this would require further investigation and evidence from other studies.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
