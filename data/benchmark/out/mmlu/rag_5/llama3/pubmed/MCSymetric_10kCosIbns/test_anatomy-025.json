["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"After reviewing the provided documents, I noticed that exhaled air is being analyzed for various organic constituents. The first document 'Characterization of human expired air: a promising investigative and diagnostic technique' mentions that the samples were concentrated and analyzed by quantitative, reproducible, and sensitive techniques which resulted in well-defined composite compositional and occurrence profiles of the organic constituents present in normal expired air. This suggests that there is a focus on detecting specific compounds or gases in exhaled air. The document 'Detection of extraneous gases in breath alcohol analysis' also discusses interfering substances such as methanol, isopropanol, aceton, ethylacetat, and toluene, which are found in expired air. This implies that these substances are present in the exhaled air samples. Carbon dioxide is mentioned in the document 'The pulmonary absorption-excretion volume effect', but not specifically in relation to its quantity in exhaled air. Similarly, carbon monoxide, nitrogen, and oxygen are not discussed in terms of their abundance in exhaled air. Therefore, I will consider the information presented and make an educated guess.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
