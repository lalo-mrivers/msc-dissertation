["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The concept of metabolic deviations highlights that metabolism is a complex system involving multiple interactions. The proposed role of drug-metabolizing enzymes suggests that these enzymes participate in the metabolism (synthesis as well as degradation) of ligands that modulate cell division, growth, morphogenesis, and mating. This implies that the control of substrates or enzymes on metabolic processes can be expressed in quantitative terms. Noninvasive approaches to tracing pathways in carbohydrate metabolism also support this notion. Therefore, it is not determined by factors such as protein size, amino acid availability, or ribonucleic acid composition.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
