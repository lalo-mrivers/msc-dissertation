["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents describe the transport of free fatty acids (FFAs) across various tissues. The first document discusses the maternal-fetal transfer of FFAs during pregnancy, where 0.19 mu-mol fatty acids/min pass into the fetuses from the maternal circulation. This suggests that the maternal circulation is an important source of fetal fatty acids. The second document reviews the metabolism of individual FFA in man and notes that the splanchnic fractional uptake differs considerably among individual FFA, while muscle uptake is virtually independent of the chemical structure of the fatty acid. The third document discusses the application of tracers in studying FFA metabolism of various organs in vivo and mentions the use of labeled palmitate or oleate to calculate fluxes of FFAs. The fourth document describes a method for determining plasma-free fatty acid kinetics with tracers, highlighting the importance of measuring individual plasma FFA kinetics. Finally, the fifth document presents a rapid gas chromatographic method for quantitating individual free fatty acids in plasma.\n\nThese documents collectively suggest that most of the free fatty acids are transported in the blood as lipoproteins or bound to albumin.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: bound to albumin.\""]
