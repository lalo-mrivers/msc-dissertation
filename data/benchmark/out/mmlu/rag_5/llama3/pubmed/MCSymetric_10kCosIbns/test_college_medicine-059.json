["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the effects of endurance training on muscle capacity. The relevant documents discuss changes in skeletal muscle metabolism in response to endurance exercise training. Specifically, the document 'Skeletal muscle adaptations to endurance training...' reports increases in aerobic energy metabolism and mitochondrial enzymes, indicating improved capacity for energy generation. Similarly, 'Effects of 8 weeks' endurance training...' and 'Effects of physical training on enzymatic activity...' discuss increased activities of aerobic enzymes such as malate dehydrogenase and succinate dehydrogenase, suggesting enhanced ability to generate energy aerobically. Finally, 'Measuring exercise-induced adaptations and injury with magnetic resonance spectroscopy...' shows that endurance training increases metabolic capacity measured by the rate of phosphocreatine recovery. Therefore, endurance training likely increases the muscle's capacity to...\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C: burn fat and carbohydrate.\""]
