["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the amount of free energy contained in FADH2 and NADH+H. Both FADH2 and NADH+H are coenzymes that participate in metabolic reactions, specifically in the context of ATP synthesis. FADH2 is involved in the electron transport chain, while NADH+H plays a role in glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway. To answer this question, we need to consider the energy released from these coenzymes during their participation in these reactions. The key observation here is that the reduction of FAD (flavin adenine dinucleotide) by electrons from NADH+H results in the formation of FADH2 and a molecule of ATP. This ATP is then used to drive other cellular processes, such as glycolysis or the pentose phosphate pathway. Therefore, considering the energy released from these coenzymes during their participation in these reactions, we can conclude that pairs of electrons carried in the form of FADH2 and NADH+H contain enough free energy to rephosphorylate 6 ATP.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A: 6 ATP.\""]
