["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the spatial kinematics of the femoro-tibial articulation of the human knee, discussing the instantaneous velocities and incremental displacements. The document on spatial kinematics states that the entire flexion of the human knee joint was experimentally studied by means of spatial solid kinematic theory. This suggests that the normal range of flexion at the knee joint is not explicitly stated in terms of degrees. However, we can infer from the study that the normal range of flexion is likely to be within the parameters described.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
