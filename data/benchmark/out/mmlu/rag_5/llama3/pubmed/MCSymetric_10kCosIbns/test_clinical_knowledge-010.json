["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for compatible blood types that can be given to a person with a blood group B (rhesus negative). This means we need to consider the ABO system antigens. According to the provided documents, there are different subgroups of B antigen, including Bv. Since the individual has a rhesus negative blood type, we only need to focus on the ABO system. The text states that Bv red cells give a negative reaction with polyclonal anti-B reagents absorbed with rabbit red cells, which means they do not have the same epitope as other B antigens. Therefore, we can conclude that the individual has a distinct category of B subgroup (Bv) and not just a regular B antigen.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C\n}"]
