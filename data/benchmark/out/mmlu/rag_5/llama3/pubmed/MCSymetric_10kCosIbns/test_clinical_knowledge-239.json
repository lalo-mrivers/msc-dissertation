["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about anaerobic metabolism, which refers to the generation of ATP without using oxygen. The relevant documents mention that anaerobic energy-yielding reactions involve the phosphorylated compounds mediating energy transmission. In contrast, aerobic phosphorylation and photophosphorylation in prokaryotes seem to require special submembranous structures; and in eukaryotes, energy conversion is a function of special organelles, the mitochondria and chloroplasts. The discovery of an analogous participation of phosphate in muscle glycolysis connected the metabolic generation of energy-rich phosphate bonds fed into a common transmitter, adenosine triphosphate (ATP), with the production of mechanical energy through the finding that the phosphoryl group of creatine phosphate transferred to ATP could supply the energy for muscle contraction.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D\n}"]
