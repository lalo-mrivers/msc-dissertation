["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The main fate of lactate that leaves muscle and enters the circulation is discussed in multiple articles. The two primary fates of lactate in skeletal muscle are oxidation and glycogen synthesis (glyconeogenesis). Oxidation of lactate is quantitatively the most important means of disposing of lactate, whether in exercising or nonexercising muscle. Lactate transport in skeletal muscle cells: uptake in L6 myoblasts suggests that lactate uptake occurs by passive diffusion. Therefore, it can be inferred that the main fate of lactate that leaves muscle and enters the circulation is likely oxidation.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D\n}"]
