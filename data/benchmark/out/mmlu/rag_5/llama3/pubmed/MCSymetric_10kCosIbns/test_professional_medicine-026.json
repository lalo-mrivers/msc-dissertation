["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has a wound caused by hot grease on her left leg. The document 'Clinical picture and pathomorphology of traumatic high-pressure oil injections' talks about the formation of epithelioid-cell-like granulation tissue after an injection of oil or grease. This process is characterized by the development of histiocytic cell infiltrations, which are transformed into epithelioid cells due to the chemico-toxic influence of the foreign substance.
