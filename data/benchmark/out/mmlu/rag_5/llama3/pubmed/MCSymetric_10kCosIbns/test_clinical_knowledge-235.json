["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, I will analyze the effects of exercise on blood glucose concentration. In 'Effect of glucose on plasma glucagon and free fatty acids during prolonged exercise', it is mentioned that a progressive decrease in blood glucose was observed during 4 hours of exercise without glucose ingestion. However, this study does not specifically mention high intensity intermittent exercise for 80-90 minutes. Therefore, I will focus on other studies.\n\nIn 'Metabolic and hormonal changes during exercise in healthy, diabetic and obese subjects', moderate physical activity did not lead to significant changes in blood glucose concentration in healthy subjects. However, this study also does not mention high intensity intermittent exercise.\n\nIn 'Serum insulin and glucose response to graded exercise in adults. Part I: the influence of fitness status', it is mentioned that during exercise, serum glucose concentrations increased significantly in active individuals. This suggests that high intensity exercise may lead to an increase in blood glucose concentration.\n\nHowever, this study also mentions that sedentary individuals did not experience a significant change in serum glucose concentrations during exercise. Therefore, I will consider the possibility of varying effects on blood glucose concentration based on fitness status.\n\nBased on these studies, it is possible that high intensity intermittent exercise may lead to an increase or no change in blood glucose concentration, depending on individual factors such as fitness level.\n\nI will analyze the choice options:\n\nA: frequently rises by 1 - 3 mM. This option seems unlikely given the mixed effects observed in different studies.\nB: remains relatively unchanged. This option is also possible considering the varying effects observed in different studies.\nC: frequently falls by 1 - 3 mM. This option does not seem to be supported by any of the provided studies, as most studies did not observe a significant decrease in blood glucose concentration during exercise.\nD: falls to hypoglycaemic levels. This option also does not seem to be supported by any of the provided studies.\n\nBased on this analysis, I will choose option B: remains relatively unchanged.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
