["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents provide information on circulatory disorders. Based on [Hemodynamic parameters which should be watched during and immediately after extracorporeal circulation], we know that central venous pressure (CVP) is an essential factor to watch, as excess CVP can lead to cerebral oedema. In [Fast diagnosis of hemodynamic disorders in patients with heart disease], the authors found that the most informative parameter for diagnosing blood volume disorders combined with cardiac failure was indeed the CVP. Combining this information, we can infer that elevated CVP could be indicative of circulatory overload.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
