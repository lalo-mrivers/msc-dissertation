["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the provided documents, we can identify that trisomy is a common chromosomal abnormality found in spontaneously aborted fetuses. According to the document 'A cytogenetic study of human spontaneous abortions using banding techniques', over a third of the singletons had an extra chromosome 16, more than 10% had an extra 21 or 22 and about 5% had an extra 2, 18 or 15. This suggests that trisomies can occur in various chromosomes. Based on this information, we can infer that a karyotype such as 47,XY,+13 (trisomy 13) would not be compatible with survival to birth. Additionally, the document 'Prenatal diagnosis of chromosome abnormalities' mentions that prospective parents at risk of producing offspring with disability due to chromosomal abnormalities should have evaluation of the 15 or 16 week fetus by karyotype of amniotic fluid cells. This implies that certain karyotypes may be associated with an increased risk of spontaneous abortion, and therefore would not be compatible with survival to birth.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
