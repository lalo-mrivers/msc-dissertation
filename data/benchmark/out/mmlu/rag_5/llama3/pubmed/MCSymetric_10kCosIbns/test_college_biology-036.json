["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the properties of a sarcomere of a striated muscle. A sarcomere is the functional unit of skeletal muscle that consists of actin filaments (thin filaments) and myosin filaments (thick filaments). In the relaxed position, tropomyosin covers the binding site on actin, preventing myosin from interacting with it. This is a normal state for the sarcomere. During contraction, the H zones do not become elongated but instead the A band remains unchanged while the I band and Z disk move towards the center of the sarcomere. The proteins troponin and tropomyosin are part of the thin filaments, not the thick filaments. Each myosin head has an actin-binding site and an ATP-hydrolyzing site, allowing it to interact with actin and hydrolyze ATP during muscle contraction.\", \"answer_choice\": C}"]
