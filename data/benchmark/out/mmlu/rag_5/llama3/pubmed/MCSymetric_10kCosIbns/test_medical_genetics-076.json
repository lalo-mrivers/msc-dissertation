["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about a condition caused by a trinucleotide (triplet) repeat expansion. Trinucleotide repeats are small DNA sequences that are repeated multiple times. The relevant documents describe the process of imperfect nearby repeats mutating to form perfect repeats, which can create excess number of direct repeats in intergenic DNA. This mechanism may be a common cause of mutations, including single-base changes. One of the conditions mentioned is Huntington disease, which is known to be caused by an expansion of CAG repeats.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
