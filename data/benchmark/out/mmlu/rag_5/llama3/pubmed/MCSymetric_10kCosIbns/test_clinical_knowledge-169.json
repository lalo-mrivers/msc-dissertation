["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks which nucleotide base is not found in RNA. The documents provided are about the conformational features of RNA duplex, codons and nearest-neighbor nucleotide pairs in mammalian messenger RNA, the arrangement of nucleotides in the coding regions of natural templates, use of specific endonuclease cleavage in RNA sequencing, and a direct chemical method for sequencing RNA. None of these documents mention Thymine. Adenine, Uracil, and Guanine are all mentioned as bases found in RNA. Therefore, the answer is likely to be A: Thymine.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
