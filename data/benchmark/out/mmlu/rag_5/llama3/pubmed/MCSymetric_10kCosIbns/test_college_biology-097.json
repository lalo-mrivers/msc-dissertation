["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to the provided documents, antibiotics target specific stages of bacterial metabolism. Inhibitors of the biosynthesis of the bacterial cell wall, such as penicillins and cephalosporins, target peptidoglycan synthesis. Inhibitors of protein synthesis, including aminoglycosides, target the 30S subunit of bacterial ribosomes. Inhibitors of nucleic acid metabolism include antibiotics that affect DNA synthesis, but there is no mention of reverse transcriptase as a target. Therefore, D: reverse transcriptase is not mentioned as an exception.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
