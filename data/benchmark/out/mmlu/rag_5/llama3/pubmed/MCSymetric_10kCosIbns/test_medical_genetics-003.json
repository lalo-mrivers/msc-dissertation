["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"In the provided documents, we can see that GC-pair distribution in the DNA of simian SA7 and human type 6 adenoviruses is described. This suggests that guanine (G) pairs with cytosine (C). Similarly, in the document discussing the 3'-terminal nucleotide sequences of adenovirus types 2 and 5 DNA, we see that the terminal sequences terminate with the sequence ...pCpC...pGpApTpG3', which further supports the pairing of guanine with cytosine.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
