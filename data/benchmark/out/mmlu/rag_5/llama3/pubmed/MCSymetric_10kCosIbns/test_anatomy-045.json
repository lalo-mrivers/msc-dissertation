["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the provided documents, it is clear that the cranial base grows through a combination of posteroanterior and anteroposterior sequences. The basicranium chondrifies and ossifies in a posteroanterior sequence, while the synchondroses respond to 'built-in' and local influences, showing symmetric or asymmetric bipolar growth and ceasing growth long before synostosis. In terms of the viscerocranium, it is mentioned that early bone formation occurs in close relation to the mandibular nerve, the maxillary nerve, the palatine nerve, and the naso-palatine nerve. This suggests that the bones of the viscerocranium develop initially by intramembranous ossification.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: intramembranous ossification and follow the neural growth pattern.\""]
