["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the most likely cause of acute urinary retention of urine. Acute urinary retention can be caused by various factors such as neurological disorders, spinal cord lesions, or psychological factors. The given documents describe cases of acute urinary retention due to psychogenic causes, organic pathology, and postoperative complications.\n\nFrom the information provided in the documents, it is clear that the most likely cause of acute urinary retention of urine is not haematuria, bladder outflow obstruction, drinking alcohol, or kidney stones, as these are chronic conditions that would result in recurring episodes of urinary retention. Instead, the causes described in the documents suggest a more complex and multifactorial etiology.\n\nIn the document describing transient neurogenic urinary retention, the patient had no definite neurological abnormalities at the onset of his illness, but the cerebrospinal fluid contained excess protein and lymphocytes. This suggests that the cause was likely related to a neurological disorder or spinal cord lesion.\n\nSimilarly, in the case of postoperative urinary retention, the pathophysiology is complex and includes factors such as disturbance of the balance between sympathetic and parasympathetic influence on bladder and urethral function, drugs that inhibit the micturition reflex, anesthesia, and sedation. These factors would also contribute to acute urinary retention.\n\nBased on this information, it is likely that the most common cause of acute urinary retention of urine is a psychogenic or organic neurological disorder, rather than haematuria, bladder outflow obstruction, drinking alcohol, or kidney stones.\", \"answer_choice\": B}"]
