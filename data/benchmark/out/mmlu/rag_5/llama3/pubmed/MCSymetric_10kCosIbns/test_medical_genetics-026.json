["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Angelman syndrome is a genetic disorder caused by a deletion of the maternal chromosome 15. This is evident from the provided documents, particularly [The Angelman syndrome. Does the phenotype depend on maternal inheritance?], DNA deletion and its parental origin in Angelman syndrome patients., and Angelman's syndrome was described by Angelman in 1965... About one half of the cases have a cytogenetically visible deletion involving the long arm of chromosome 15, del (15) (q11-q13). Thus the deletion is cytogenetically similar to the one found in some Prader-Willi syndrome patients, but it differs in parental origin, being maternal in Angelman's syndrome and paternal in Prader-Willi's syndrome.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
