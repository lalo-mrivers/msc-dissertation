["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about a process that uses only the gradient of material to control the direction in which the material moves across the cell membrane. Osmosis is a process where molecules move from an area of higher concentration to one of lower concentration, driven by the difference in concentration. This matches the description given in the question. Therefore, osmosis is the correct answer.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
