["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the cellular uptake of cholesterol. The documents mention that recent identification of specific cellular receptors for uptake of plasma lipoproteins represents a significant advance for understanding regulation of both plasma and tissue concentrations, possibly of the basic mechanisms underlying accumulation of cholesterol in atherosclerotic plaques. Additionally, the intracellular movement of cholesterol may involve complex pathways by which the sterol moves to various cellular sites and mediates transcriptional regulation, enzyme activation, and protein degradation. Therefore, we can infer that cholesterol uptake involves cell-surface receptors.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
