["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents highlight that blood lactate concentrations can be influenced by factors like site of sampling, distribution of lactate in the blood, and type of exercise. The 'Activity profile of competition soccer' study shows a significant correlation between high intensity running during matches and blood lactate values. This suggests that blood lactate concentration can increase with intense physical activity. Furthermore, the 'Post-competition blood lactate concentrations in collegiate swimmers' investigation reports higher mean blood lactate concentrations in swimmers after competing in longer races. This indicates that blood lactate concentration can increase as players become more fatigued throughout the course of a game. Therefore, it is likely that blood lactate concentration increases throughout the course of the game.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
