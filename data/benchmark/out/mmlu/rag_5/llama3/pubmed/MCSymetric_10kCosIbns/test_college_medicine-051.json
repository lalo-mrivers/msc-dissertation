["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking which of the given options is not an amino acid. We can analyze each option by comparing it to the relevant documents. The first two options, Glutamic acid and Aspartic acid, are natural amino acids as mentioned in the document [Hidden symmetry of the genetic code and laws of amino acid interaction]. Glutamine is also a natural amino acid that is mentioned in the same document. Palmitic acid is not an amino acid but rather a fatty acid, which is mentioned in the document [On the regulatory role of amino acids in biosynthesis and formation of protein structure] as part of an animal ration. Therefore, based on this analysis, we can conclude that Palmitic acid is not an amino acid.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
