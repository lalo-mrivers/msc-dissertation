["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the given documents, it is clear that mammals are homeostatic for temperature, pH, osmotic pressure, contents of ions, water, and p0(2). These rigid constants need to be maintained at a constant level to ensure optimal activity of enzymes. This information can be found in the 'Mechanism of general adaptation' document. Therefore, it is unlikely that mammals are homeostatic for metabolic rate, which is not mentioned as one of these rigid constants.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
