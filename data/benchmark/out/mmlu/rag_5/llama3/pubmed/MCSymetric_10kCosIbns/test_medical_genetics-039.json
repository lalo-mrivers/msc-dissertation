["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the epigenetic inheritance system described by Mayr and Provine (1980). The relevant documents describe the mechanism of genetic-epigenetic interaction and how it can affect gene expression. Epigenetic mechanisms are responsible for heritable changes in gene expression, which can be influenced by environmental factors. Reactivation of a silent Ac following tissue culture is associated with heritable alterations in its methylation pattern, demonstrating epigenetic inheritance. The documents also discuss the relationship between spontaneous mutation rates in vivo and in vitro, but this is not directly relevant to the question.\n\nThe term 'epigenetic inheritance' suggests that heritable changes can occur without a change in DNA sequence. This concept is distinct from genotype inheritance (A), which refers to the transmission of traits due to genetic variation. Soft inheritance (B) is not a well-established scientific term and does not fit with the context of epigenetics.\n\nThe documents do not explicitly mention 'RNA inheritance' (C) or 'hard inheritance' (D). Instead, they focus on the mechanisms of epigenetic inheritance, which involve changes in gene expression that can be influenced by environmental factors and are heritable through cell generations.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
