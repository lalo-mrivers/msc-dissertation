["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents discuss the study of twins in humans, specifically mentioning monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) pairs. The traditional role of twin studies has been to assess the relative role of genetic factors as a first step in defining the genetic architecture of complex traits. This is achieved by comparing the similarity between MZ pairs, who share all their genes, with DZ pairs, who share 50% of their genes on average. Therefore, it can be inferred that twin studies are useful because they allow genetic influences on variation in a trait to be estimated.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
