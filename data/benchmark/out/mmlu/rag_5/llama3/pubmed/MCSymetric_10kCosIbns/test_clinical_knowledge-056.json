["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, creatine supplementation has been shown to increase serum-creatine-phosphokinase (SCK) activity in animal experiments [Intramuscular injections and activity of serum creatine phosphokinase. Histopathological study in animal experiments]. In humans, supplementation with 5g of creatine monohydrate resulted in a significant increase in the total creatine content of muscle measured in 17 subjects [Elevation of creatine in resting and exercised muscle of normal subjects by creatine supplementation]. There is no information provided that suggests an expected side effect of creatine supplementation, such as muscle weakness or loss of electrolytes. Therefore, I will focus on the given options.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A: muscle weakness.\""]
