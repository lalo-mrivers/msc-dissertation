["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The provided documents discuss the mechanisms of spontaneous and induced heteroploidization and polyploidization. In untreated populations, cells with different chromosome number are formed by mitotic non-disjunction. Mononuclear polyploid cells are formed by repeated DNA synthesis (endoreduplication) and polynuclear giant cells by postmitotic fusion of the daughter cells. These phenomena occur more frequently in cell populations treated with cystostatic drugs.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
