["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents provide information on human thermoregulatory responses to different thermal environments. According to the documents, when exposed to heat, humans increase their metabolic rate, ventilation, heart rate, and sweat gland activity to maintain a narrow range of internal body temperatures (36-38Â°C). The documents also describe experiments where rats' tissue respiration was studied during prolonged exposure to high ambient temperature, showing decreased oxygen consumption by tissues. Considering these findings, the body's compensation for increased environmental temperature is likely related to heat production and dissipation.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
