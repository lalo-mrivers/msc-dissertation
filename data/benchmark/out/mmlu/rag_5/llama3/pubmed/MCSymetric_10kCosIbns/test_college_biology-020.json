["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks why enzymes are effective in facilitating chemical reactions. Enzymes are macromolecules that provide a highly specific stereochemistry and microenvironment in the active site, which is necessary for their catalytic activity. This implies that the correct answer lies in the mechanism of enzyme action rather than a general effect on temperature or equilibrium constants. The relevant documents discuss the molecular mechanisms underlying enzymatic reactions, including the role of cofactors, thermodynamics, and chemical evolution before the appearance of coded polypeptide enzymes. Given this context, the most plausible explanation is that enzymes lower the activation energy, thereby speeding up the conversion of reactants to products.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
