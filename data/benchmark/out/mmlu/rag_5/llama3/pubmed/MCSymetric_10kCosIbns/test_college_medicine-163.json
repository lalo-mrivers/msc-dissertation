["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the effects of increasing the number of sprints on various physiological parameters. The relevant information can be found in the 'Biomechanics of sprint running' document, which discusses the factors that affect performance in sprint running. One of these factors is anaerobic metabolism, which is used to generate high-intensity efforts like those required in sprinting. As the number of sprints increases, it is likely that the anaerobic contribution will also increase as a result.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
