["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks when maximal dynamic exercise becomes predominantly aerobic. This is related to the concept of endurance and Vo2 max. The first document describes the nature of training response, including peripheral and central adaptations to one-legged exercise. It discusses the effects of sprint and endurance training on oxygen uptake (Vo2), heart rate, and blood lactate. From this, we can infer that aerobic metabolism plays a significant role in prolonged intensive exercise.\n\nThe second document reviews the factors involved in prolonged intensive exercise, highlighting the importance of Vo2 max and endurance. Endurance is defined as the maximal period of time during which a given percentage of Vo2 max can be sustained. This implies that maximal dynamic exercise will become predominantly aerobic once the body has adapted to sustain a high percentage of Vo2 max over an extended period.\n\nThe third document discusses the assessment of the static component in rhythmic exercise, including isometric endurance and belt tension. However, this does not directly relate to the question about when maximal dynamic exercise becomes predominantly aerobic.\n\nThe fourth document presents cardiorespiratory and metabolic responses to positive, negative, and minimum-load dynamic leg exercise. It shows that oxygen uptake increases with ergometric load in a parabolic fashion, suggesting that aerobic metabolism is important for prolonged exercise.\n\nFinally, the fifth document discusses distinctive effects of three different modes of exercise on oxygen uptake, heart rate, and blood lactate and pyruvate. This does not directly relate to the question about when maximal dynamic exercise becomes predominantly aerobic.\n\nBased on these documents, we can conclude that endurance training leads to an increase in Vo2 max and an improvement in aerobic metabolism. Therefore, after 4 weeks of endurance training (as described in the first document), maximal dynamic exercise will become predominantly aerobic.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
