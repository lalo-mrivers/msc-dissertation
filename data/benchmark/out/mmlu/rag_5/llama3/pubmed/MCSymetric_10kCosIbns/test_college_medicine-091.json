["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents discuss the structure of proteins at different levels. The first document talks about the stereochemical analysis of polypeptide chains and mentions hydrogen bonds between side chains and the backbone. The second document explains how interpeptide ionic bridges can constrain amino-acid residues into eight conformations. The third document discusses side-chain conformation in proteins, while the fourth document investigates the influence of side chain structures on residue-residue associations in globular proteins. Considering these documents, we can conclude that peptide bonds link amino acids in a protein.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
