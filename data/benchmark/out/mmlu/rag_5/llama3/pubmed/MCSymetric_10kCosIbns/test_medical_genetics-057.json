["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking what type of DNA mutation is associated with Leber's hereditary optic atrophy. Upon reviewing the documents, it is mentioned that 'the discovery of at least one mitochondrial DNA mutation associated with the disease has provided the basis for a molecular diagnosis in about 50% of families with LHON' (Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy: clinical and molecular genetic aspects). Additionally, other documents such as Mitochondrial DNA analysis of Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy also confirm that a mitochondrial DNA mutation is associated with the disease. Therefore, the answer is D: mitochondrial DNA.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
