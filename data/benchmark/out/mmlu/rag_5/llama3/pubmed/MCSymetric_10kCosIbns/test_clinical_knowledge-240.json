["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, we need to convert the athlete's steady-rate oxygen uptake from liters per minute (L/min) to milliliters per minute (mL/min). Since there are 1000 mL in 1 L, we can multiply the average oxygen uptake by 1000: 3.0 L/min x 1000 = 3000 mL/min.\n\nNext, we need to determine the energy expenditure in kJ. The formula for energy expenditure is energy expenditure (in kJ) = VO2 (in mL/min) x 5 minutes x 20.93/22.4, where 20.93 and 22.4 are the molar volumes of O2 at standard temperature and pressure.\n\nPlugging in the numbers, we get: energy expenditure = 3000 mL/min x 5 min x 20.93/22.4 = approximately 500 kJ.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
