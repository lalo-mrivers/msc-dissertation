["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The text describes univentricular hearts of right ventricular type with double or common inlet. The atria connect directly to a chamber with right ventricular characteristics. There is no mention of semilunar valves being present, so option A is not correct. Papillary muscles are mentioned in the context of preventing a valve from everting, but it's not clear which valve this refers to. Systole is also not relevant to the description of the atrioventricular valve. The text does describe how blood returns to the heart during relaxation, so option D could be related to the correct answer. However, the key point is that the right atrioventricular valve 'straddles' the main chamber in many cases, which suggests it may not have a normal function. Therefore, option B is the most likely correct answer.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
