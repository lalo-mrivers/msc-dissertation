["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks what tissue secretes B-hCG, and its function. From the given documents, it is mentioned that hCG is a pregnancy-associated protein. In one of the documents, it is stated that 'These molecules are compared and contrasted with human chorionic gonadotropin, the first pregnancy-associated protein to be discovered, and the standard biomarker of pregnancy to which all others must still be referenced.' This suggests that hCG is secreted by the blastocyst. The function of hCG is also mentioned in another document, where it states 'hCG concentrations were measured in the sera of 443 pregnant women by the beta-hCG radioimmunoassay...' This implies that hCG plays a role in pregnancy detection and monitoring.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D: Blastocyst, corpus luteum maintenance\"}"]
