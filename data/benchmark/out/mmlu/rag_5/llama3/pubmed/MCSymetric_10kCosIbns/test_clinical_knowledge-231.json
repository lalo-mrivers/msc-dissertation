["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, it can be seen that the effects of fatigue with stretch-shortening exercise were studied. In this study, no changes occurred in reflex latency and peak-to-peak duration of the compound muscle action potential (AP), but reflex time, AP duration, and AP amplitude increased by 6.4, 6.1, and 23.3%, respectively. This suggests that subjects compensated for the loss of voluntary force by lengthening the activity duration of the prime movers, potentiating muscle fiber action potentials, and/or enhancing muscle spindle sensitivity.\n\nIn the study on neuronal mechanisms of human locomotion, it was found that the electrical activity of the gastrocnemius muscle increased sharply 35--45 ms after ground contact and reached its maximum at the end of muscle stretch. This activity was superimposed on a slowly increasing level of activation, which began 120--180 ms before ground contact.\n\nIn another study, the effects of endurance training were examined. For 75% of the subjects, Waer,max and reflex parameters (T or H) varied in the same direction: most of them exhibited higher values of both Waer,max and reflex amplitudes while the others had Waer,max and reflex values hardly modified or decreased.\n\nIn a study on Enzyme activities and muscle strength after \"sprint training\" in man, it was found that subjects compensated for the loss of voluntary force by lengthening the activity duration of the prime movers, potentiating muscle fiber action potentials, and/or enhancing muscle spindle sensitivity. This suggests that the first fibre types to fatigue are not Type I fibres.\n\nTherefore, based on these findings, it can be concluded that the first fibre types to fatigue in all-out exercise such as sprinting are not Type I fibres.\", \"answer_choice\": D}"]
