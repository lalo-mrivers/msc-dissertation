["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the ratio of A:T bases in the newly synthesized complementary strand of DNA. We know that the template strand has a ratio of 3:2 of A:T bases. This means that for every 5 nucleotides (3 As and 2 Ts), there is one more A than T. Since DNA polymerase adds complimentary nucleotides to the template strand, we can conclude that the newly synthesized complementary strand will have a ratio of 2:3 of A:T bases.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
