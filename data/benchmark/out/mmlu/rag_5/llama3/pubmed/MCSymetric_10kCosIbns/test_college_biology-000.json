["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about controlling a mosquito population based on characteristic population curves. The characteristic population curve for a species refers to the logistic curve, which depicts the growth of a species' population over time. The curve has three main stages: lag phase, exponential phase, and plateau phase. To control the population effectively, one needs to consider what stage of the curve we are in. Since DDT was used in the past for mosquito control, it's likely that we're looking at reducing the carrying capacity (K value) or increasing mortality rate to reduce the population. However, maintaining the population at the midpoint of the logistic curve or opting for zero population control once the K value is reached doesn't make sense as these strategies wouldn't effectively control the population.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
