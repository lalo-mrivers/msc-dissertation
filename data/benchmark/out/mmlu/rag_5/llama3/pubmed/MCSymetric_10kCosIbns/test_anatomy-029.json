["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the anatomy and physiology of the atrioventricular conduction system. In univentricular hearts of left ventricular type, an anterior or lateral atrioventricular node is present from which the prenentrating bundle descends onto the trabecular septum. The His bundle electrography document explains that recording His potentials allows identification of conduction disturbances at a level above, in, or below the His bundle. There is no mention of autonomic nerve processes forming part of the atrioventricular bundle.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
