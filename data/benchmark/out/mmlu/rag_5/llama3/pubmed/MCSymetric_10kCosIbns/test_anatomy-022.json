["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the regional lymphatic drainage of the left side of the tip of the tongue. The relevant documents describe the anatomy of the lymphatic drainage of the lower lip mucosa and its relation to the submandibular lymph nodes, but do not specifically address the tongue.
