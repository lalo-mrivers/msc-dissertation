["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, Type I muscle fibers are characterized as 'red' and having an oxidative potential. The text also mentions that Type I fibers have a higher mitochondrial volume percentage compared to Type II fibers. Additionally, the metabolic characteristics document states that Type I fibers have approximately 1.5 times the activity of succinate-dehydrogenase (SDH) and 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA-dehydrogenase (HAD) enzymes compared to Type II fibers.\n\nFrom these findings, it can be concluded that Type I muscle fibers are 'red', oxidative, and have a slow contracting speed.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
