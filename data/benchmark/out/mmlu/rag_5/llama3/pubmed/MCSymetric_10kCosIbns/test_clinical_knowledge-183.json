["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe various types of cannulas for different purposes, such as experimental surgery, perfusion, digestion, and secretion studies. There is no specific mention of the maximum time a cannula can remain in situ. However, it can be inferred that some cannulas are designed for long-term use, such as the 'gastric fistula' described in the first document, which aims to avoid irritation of animals as much as possible. This suggests that a cannula can potentially remain in situ for an extended period. The technique for casting chronic extradural and intracerebral cannula arrays also implies long-term use.\", \"answer_choice\": C}"]
