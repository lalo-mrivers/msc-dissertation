["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the differences between cyanobacteria and green unicellular algae. One of the relevant documents describes the characteristics of a new cyanophage that lysing unicellular cyanobacteria of the genus Synechococcus, which implies that Synechococcus are unicellular. The other document describes the base composition and DNA content in single-cell Cyanobacteria, which also suggests that Cyanobacteria can be unicellular. On the other hand, green algae are generally multicellular, whereas cyanobacteria can be unicellular or filamentous. This difference in cell structure is a key characteristic that distinguishes cyanobacteria from green unicellular algae.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"]
