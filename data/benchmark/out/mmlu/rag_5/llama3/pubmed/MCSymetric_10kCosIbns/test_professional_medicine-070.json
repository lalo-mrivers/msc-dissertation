["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has a stab wound to the chest and is unresponsive to painful stimuli. He has a pulse but his blood pressure is low. He needs rapid transportation to the nearest Emergency Department capable of handling this type of injury. First, we need to assure an adequate airway and adequate ventilation. The patient is already intubated and mechanically ventilated. Next, we should be concerned with adequate circulation--this may mean the administration of intravenous fluids, specifically volume expanders, via large-bore cannulae. We don't have any information about cardiac tamponade or pericardial effusion, so we shouldn't suspect that yet. We do have jugular venous distension and normal breath sounds, which could indicate a possible tension pneumothorax. But first, let's stabilize the patient and transport him to the Emergency Department.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
