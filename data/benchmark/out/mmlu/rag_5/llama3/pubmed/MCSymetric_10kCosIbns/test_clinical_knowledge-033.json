["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about calcium metabolism. From the provided documents, we can gather information about calcium's role in bone cells, its distribution between pools, and the effects of metabolic inhibitors and parathyroid hormone. The first document highlights that Ca2+ levels supported by efflux from bone were observed as acute effects of metabolic inhibitors. This suggests that alterations in calcium levels can occur due to changes in energy status of the bone cells. The second document discusses the role of hormones like parathyroid hormone, thyrocalcitonin, and 1,25 dihydroxy Vitamin D(3) in maintaining calcium levels and skeletal integrity. The third document shows how acidosis affects cellular calcium metabolism by decreasing all three cellular calcium pools and depressing calcium fluxes between them. The fourth document explains that calcium removal from and redistribution in bone is mediated by the bone cells, while the fifth document provides an overview of calcium metabolism.\n\nConsidering these points, we can infer that metabolic inhibitors can affect calcium levels supported by efflux from bone. This suggests that part of the metabolically derived efflux may be attributed to acid production (aerobic glycolysis) rather than cellular activities not yet defined. The role of hormones and their impact on maintaining calcium levels and skeletal integrity is also important. Additionally, acidosis can affect cellular calcium metabolism by decreasing all three cellular calcium pools and depressing calcium fluxes between them.\", \n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
