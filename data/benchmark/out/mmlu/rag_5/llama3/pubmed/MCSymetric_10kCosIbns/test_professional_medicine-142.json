["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient had cholecystectomy for protracted ileus, which is a complication after surgery. The study [Postoperative small intestinal absorption after cholecystectomy] suggests that the resorption in the small intestine after cholecystectomie was found out by means of the modified D-xylose resorption test and it was lower in the immediate postoperative phase. This may lead to hypoalbuminemia, hypovolemia, and unfavorable nutritional status for forthcoming surgery. The study [Nutrition disorders in patients with acute calculous cholecystitis] also suggests that transcutaneous transhepatic puncture and laparoscopy of the gall bladder are able to correct unwanted effects and prepare the patients for radical surgery. Considering these factors, it is reasonable to assume that the patient needs nutritional support to recover from the surgery.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
