["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about which molecule is encoded by the src oncogene and catalyzes the specific addition of phosphate groups to cellular proteins. The provided documents mention that the src kinase can influence several new pathways of inositol phosphate metabolism, including the production of novel D-3 phosphoinositides. Additionally, it is mentioned that the src transformation can alter the expression of certain inositol polyphosphates. This information suggests that the src oncogene may be related to the addition of phosphate groups to cellular proteins.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
