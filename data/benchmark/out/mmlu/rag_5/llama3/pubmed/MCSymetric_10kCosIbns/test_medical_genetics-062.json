["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To calculate the likelihood of an individual carrying two specific alleles, we need to find the probability that both alleles are present. Since each allele has a frequency of 0.2, the probability of one allele being present is 0.2. The probability of the other allele being present is also 0.2. Since the events are independent (i.e., having one allele does not affect the presence of the other), we can multiply the probabilities to get the probability that both alleles are present: 0.2 * 0.2 = 0.04. This means the likelihood of an individual carrying two specific alleles is 0.04.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
