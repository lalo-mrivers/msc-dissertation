["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the flow of blood from the right ventricle. The first document describes a study on the establishment of blood flow from the right ventricle to the pulmonary artery during diastole. This suggests that one possible option is C: Pulmonary arteries. However, the other documents provide more information about univentricular hearts and their characteristics. Specifically, the morphology and conducting tissue in univentricular hearts of right ventricular type suggest that there may be a rudimentary chamber posteriorly, which could potentially receive blood from the right ventricle. The phasic characteristics of arterial inflow and venous outflow of right ventricular myocardium also provide some clues about the flow of blood between different chambers. Finally, the conducting tissues in univentricular heart of right ventricular type with double or common inlet suggest that there may be a connection between the right ventricle and a rudimentary chamber.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
