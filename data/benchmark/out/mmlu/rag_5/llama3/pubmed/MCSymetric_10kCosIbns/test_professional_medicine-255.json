["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is experiencing symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), including abdominal bloating, upper abdominal discomfort, constipation, and improved symptoms after bowel movements. The patient does not have a history of taking medications or engaging in harmful habits that could be contributing to their symptoms.\n\nBased on the provided documents, drug therapy for IBS aims to relieve specific symptoms. Tranquilizers and antispasmodics may be used, but their efficacy is limited.

Since the patient has constipation as one of their primary symptoms, a bulking agent like Lubiprostone could be an effective treatment option.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
