["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks why proteins are treated with a detergent (SDS) before being run through an electrophoresis gel. One of the documents describes the use of SDS-PAGE, which mentions that SDS serves as a detergent. This suggests that the treatment is related to the interaction between the proteins and the gel.
