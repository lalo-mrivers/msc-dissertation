["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the pH-dependence of the activity of an enzyme. The text states that 'the pH-dependence of kcat is determined only by A' (refer to point 3). This means that if the activity of the enzyme is constant over a broad range of pH values, it suggests that there are no ionizing groups on either the enzyme or substrate participating in the reaction.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
