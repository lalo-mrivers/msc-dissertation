["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents provide information on exercise capacity and physical fitness. The oxygen uptake (VO2 max) is a measure of aerobic power, which is related to cardiac output. A high heart rate is associated with low stroke volume. The study 'Cardiorespiratory mobilization and endurance performance' presents data on the effects of prior exercise (PE) at different intensities on cardiorespiratory mobilization during exercise. It suggests that PE can affect VO2 and aerobic fitness. The study 'Work intensities of different modes of exercise testings in clinical use' highlights the importance of considering mode of exercise when comparing results. The study 'Comparison between arm and leg exercise in women and men' presents data on oxygen consumption, ventilation, and heart rate during arm and leg exercise. The study 'Exercise induced serum enzyme changes in untrained subjects' shows that moderate physical effort can lead to increased serum enzyme values (GOT, GPT, LDH, and Aldolase). Based on these studies, it is possible to infer that the higher the intensity of exercise, the greater the proportional contribution of anaerobic energy production.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
