["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The concept of adaptation refers to the process by which sensory systems adjust to constant or repetitive stimuli. In this case, we are looking for examples of neural adaptation. The passage on informational and neural adaptation curves suggests that adaptation can occur in both sensory and neural systems.\n\nFrom the passage on sensory transduction, we can infer that adaptation is a common goal among sensory transducers, including detection of the signal, amplification, adaptation or feedback, termination, and encoding.\n\nThe examples provided (A-D) all involve adjustment to constant or repetitive stimuli. For instance, after putting on a shirt (A), you no longer feel the sensation of the fabric due to adaptation. Similarly, after walking into a crowded room (B), you adapt to the noise and no longer find it distracting. Walking outside on a sunny day (C) allows your eyes to adapt to the brightness, and entering an anatomy lab (D) allows your nose to adapt to the smell of formaldehyde.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that not all examples provided are specifically neural adaptations. Some may be sensory adaptations or even behavioral adaptations.\n\nAfter analyzing the passages, we can conclude that adaptation refers to the process by which sensory systems adjust to constant or repetitive stimuli. This adjustment can occur in both sensory and neural systems.\", \"answer_choice\": B}"]
