["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the reasons for improved women's world record performances. The relevant documents provide information on physiological changes during endurance running and factors affecting performance. We can see that none of the documents suggest that women have evolved a greater muscle mass or that they can now run faster than men.
