["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents provide information on the functional classification of muscles that determine mandibular movements. Biologic laws governing functions of muscles that move the mandible suggest that a knowledge of the laws governing these muscles enables the dentist to acquire mandibular-manipulation skills necessary for diagnosis and effective occlusal treatment. A model in which the dentist visualizes the patient, the patient's protective reflexes, the components of the patient's gnathostomatic system, and himself as four independent personalities participating in the jaw manipulation is a useful tool in acquiring mandibular-manipulation skills. Biomechanical models of the human mandible propose that muscular forces are produced by masseter, medial pterygoid, temporal, and superior lateral pterygoid muscle components, and reaction forces are produced by the occlusal surfaces and condyle.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
