["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe studies on non-exercising muscle metabolism during exercise. They report glycogen decrements in non-exercising muscles during exercise and investigate whether the degraded glycogen is retained within the muscle or effluxed from the non-exercising muscles. The studies also examine the regulation of muscle carbohydrate metabolism during exercise, including the role of glycolytic controls and formation of triosephosphate by phosphofructokinase. Additionally, they investigate the effects of low glycogen on carbohydrate and energy metabolism in human muscle during exercise. The studies do not mention insulin, cortisol, or pH as activators of glycogen breakdown.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: none of the above\"\n}"]
