["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents indicate that DiGeorge syndrome is characterized by deletions or microdeletions of 22q11. The molecular studies also suggest that the deletion is located between D22S9 and BCRL2 at 22q11. Additionally, all 14 probands had DNA deletions detected in a study, with two loci (D22S75 and D22S259) being deleted in all patients. This suggests that the critical region for DiGeorge syndrome is located on chromosome 22. Furthermore, studies of unbalanced translocation cases also support the idea that the deletion is located on chromosome 22.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
