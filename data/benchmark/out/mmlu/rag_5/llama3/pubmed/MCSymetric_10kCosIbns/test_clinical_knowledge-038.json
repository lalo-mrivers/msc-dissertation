["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents discuss mitochondrial structure and function. The first document describes the structure of a channel in the mitochondrial outer membrane. The second document discusses the structure and function of mitochondrial ribosomes. The third and fourth documents describe the formation of a complex between mitochondrial membrane structures and DNA, as well as the characteristics of DNA fragments bound to these proteins. These texts do not mention any of the options A-D directly. However, the fourth document does discuss specific sites that interact with structural proteins of the mitochondrial inner membrane. This suggests that embedded in the inner membrane are indeed proteins.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
