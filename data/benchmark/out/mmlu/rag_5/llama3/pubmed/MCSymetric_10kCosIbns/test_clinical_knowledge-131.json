["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe Golgi tendon organs (GTOs) as sensory receptors that function as position (and force) detectors. They are found at the junction between muscle and tendon, which is supported by morphological evidence showing that the unmyelinated terminal branches of the Ib afferent fiber lie within the spaces between braids of collagen. The mechanical events that occur within the GTO appear to explain how it may function as a biological force transducer under static loading conditions.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
