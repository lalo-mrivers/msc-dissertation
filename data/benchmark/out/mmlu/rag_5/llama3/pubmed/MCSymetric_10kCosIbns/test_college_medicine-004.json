["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To solve this problem, we need to find the acceleration required for the car to reach a velocity of 130 km/h from rest. We can use the equation d = vt + (1/2)at^2 to calculate the time taken by the car to cover the distance of 50m. Since the car starts from rest, v0 = 0 and t is the time taken by the car to reach a velocity of 130 km/h. Rearranging the equation, we get t = sqrt(2d/a). We can then use this value of t to find the acceleration using the equation a = (v - v0) / t. Finally, we substitute the values and solve for a.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
