["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about nerve outgrowth from a developing neuron. The growth cone is the tip of the axon where this outgrowth begins. Exposure to cytochalasin B at this stage causes microspikes (which are made up of microfilaments) to extend and retract in order to move the growth cone forward. This suggests that exposure to cytochalasin B would cause reversible depolymerization of these microfilaments.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
