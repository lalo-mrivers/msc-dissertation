["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To solve this problem, we need to convert the athlete's steady-rate oxygen uptake from liters per minute (L/min) to milliliters per minute (mL/min). Then, we can use the equation: energy expenditure = VO2 x duration of exercise x 5.0 kJ/L. We are given that the average VO2 is 3.0 L/min and the duration of exercise is 5 minutes.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
