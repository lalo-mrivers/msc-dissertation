["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To estimate the statistical power of this study, we need to consider the sample size, type I error probability, and type II error probability. The investigators set the probability of wrongly finding that Drug X is more effective than the standard therapy as 1% (type I error), which means α = 0.01. They also set the probability of wrongly finding that the effectiveness of the two drugs is the same as 10% (type II error), which means β = 0.1.\n\nThe power calculation formula is: Power = 1 - β. Since we are given the type II error probability (β = 0.1), we can calculate the power directly. The sample size is not explicitly provided, but it is mentioned that the study includes 140 women and 60 men, for a total of n = 200 participants.\n\nUsing the formula: Power = 1 - β, where β = 0.1, we get: Power ≈ 0.9\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: 90%\""]
