["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, I understand that eukaryotic cells can condense coding regions when they are not being expressed. This suggests that gene expression is regulated by chromatin structure and modification. Histone acetylation is a key mechanism for regulating gene expression. When acting on DNA, increased histone acetyltransferase activity would typically lead to an increase in gene expression, as it relaxes chromatin structure and makes genes more accessible to transcription factors.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
