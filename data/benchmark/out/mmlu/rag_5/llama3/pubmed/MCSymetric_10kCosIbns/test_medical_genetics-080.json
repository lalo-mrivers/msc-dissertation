["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe various diagnostic techniques used to diagnose neural tube defects (NTDs). Amniocentesis is mentioned as a method that can detect NTDs by measuring alpha-fetoprotein in the amniotic fluid. Chorion villus sampling (CVS) is also mentioned as a method that can detect NTDs. Maternal serum screening is described as a method that can detect NTDs if an underdeveloped neurocranium or free communication between amniotic and cerebrospinal fluid is present. Ultrasonography is mentioned as a method that can diagnose NTDs before the 20th week of gestation by showing an underdeveloped neurocranium or free communication between amniotic and cerebrospinal fluid. Given this information, it appears that ultrasonography is the diagnostic technique of value for diagnosing neural tube defects.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
