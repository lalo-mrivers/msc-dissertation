["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the question, we need to identify the characteristics mentioned: thermophilic, methanogenic, and having isoprenylglycerol ethers in its membrane instead of phospholipids. From the provided documents, we can see that Thermoplasma and Sulfolobus are extremely thermoacidophilic bacteria that possess dibiphytanyl diglycerol tetraethers. Methanobacterium and Methanospirillum contain both diphytanyl glycerol diethers and dibiphytanyl diglycerol tetraethers in nearly equal proportions. Therefore, we can conclude that the thermophilic and methanogenic prokaryote is likely an archaeon.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
