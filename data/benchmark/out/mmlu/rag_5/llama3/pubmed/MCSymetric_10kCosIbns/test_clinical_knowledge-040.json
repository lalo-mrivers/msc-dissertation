["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks for a normal heart rate for an adult at rest. The relevant documents describe resting pulse rates from various studies. The first document, 'Epidemiology of resting pulse rate', reports national estimates for pulse rate distributions and finds that among persons 25-74 years in the NHANES Survey, women had slightly higher resting pulse rates than men. Age had no consistent effects. Pulse rate was slightly higher in whites than in blacks among women and 25-44-year-old men. Resting pulse rate was slightly higher in fall and winter than in spring and summer and in the afternoon and evening than in the morning. Blood pressure and body temperature were significantly positively associated with pulse rate independent of multiple confounders.\n\nThe second document, 'A free-running endogenous rhythm of the resting heart rate in man', reports a sine-wave oscillating rhythm of the heart rate in 24 out of 31 resting healthy subjects, with a periodicity of circa 10 min. The third document, 'Effect of increasing heart rate on Doppler indices of left ventricular performance in healthy men', shows that heart rate has a linear correlation with certain Doppler measurements.\n\nThe fourth document, '[Nyctohemeral recording of blood pressure and heart rate]', presents the results of 24-hour monitoring of blood pressure and heart rate. The mean HR ranged from 75 to 94 beats per minute (mean 84.3 +/- 31).\n\nConsidering these studies, a normal heart rate for an adult at rest can be estimated.\", \n\"answer_choice\": B"]
