["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents provided focus on physical fitness, environmental factors, and involution processes. There is no direct mention of success in sports, but we can analyze the factors that contribute to physical fitness and involution. The document 'Former athletes physical fitness' highlights genetic and environmental factors, including intensive motoric exercises, which shape involution processes. This suggests that a good coach (option C) and motivation to succeed may be important factors. Additionally, the document 'The influence of sports injuries on sport participation and work' indicates that injuries can affect sport participation and work, suggesting that innate ability and capacity to respond to training stimulus (option D) might also play a role.\n\nIn contrast, there is no mention of high energy diet and large appetite (option A), or high intelligence (option B) in the provided documents. Therefore, we can eliminate options A and B. The remaining options C and D both seem plausible, but option D seems more directly related to sports success given its emphasis on innate ability and response to training stimulus.\n\nTherefore, our analysis suggests that the main factors determining success in sport are likely a combination of good coaching (option C) and innate ability/capacity to respond to training stimulus (option D). However, we cannot definitively choose between options C and D without additional information.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
