["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, we can identify mobile regions of DNA that are capable of inserting themselves into an existing genome. The relevant information is found in the document 'Occurrence of insertion sequence (IS) regions on plasmid deoxyribonucleic acid as direct and inverted nucleotide sequence duplications'. It states that IS regions have been identified previously as a cause of strongly polar mutations in Escherichia coli and several bacteriophages. The present experiments indicate that genetically characterized IS regions occur on bacterial plasmid DNA as both direct and inverted DNA sequence duplications.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
