["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The zone of proximal development is the range of knowledge or understanding that an individual can acquire through guidance and support from more knowledgeable others. It's a concept introduced by Vygotsky to describe how children learn and develop new skills with the help of others. In this context, I'll analyze the options provided. Option A is about building muscle memory in a physical activity, which doesn't necessarily involve learning or development. Option B refers to a musician struggling to complete a piece, but it's not about the zone of proximal development, as there's no guidance from a more knowledgeable other. Option C involves a student submitting a paper for review by their professor, which is an example of seeking feedback and guidance. This aligns with the concept of the zone of proximal development. Therefore, I conclude that option C accurately describes an individual in the zone of proximal development.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
