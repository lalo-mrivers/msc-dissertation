["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks for the most specific indicator of pulmonary arterial hypertension on physical examination. We can look at the relevant documents to find an answer. The 'Clinical profile and treatment of acute pulmonary embolism' document mentions that during acute pulmonary embolism, when the heart and lungs are normal, the mean pulmonary artery pressure never exceeds 40 mmHg. This is the maximum pressure the right ventricle can stand. Therefore, we can look for signs related to pulmonary arterial hypertension.\n\nThe 'Thromboembolic pulmonary arterial hypertension' document explains that during chronic thromboembolism, the right ventricle can adapt to slowly increasing pulmonary artery pressure, but during acute pulmonary embolism, the mean pulmonary artery pressure never exceeds 40 mmHg. This suggests that signs of pulmonary arterial hypertension would be more likely present in patients with chronic thromboembolism.\n\nThe 'Relation of plain chest radiographic findings to pulmonary arterial pressure and arterial blood oxygen levels in patients with acute pulmonary embolism' document mentions that patients with either a prominent central pulmonary artery or cardiomegaly had higher pulmonary arterial mean pressures than did patients with atelectasis, a pulmonary parenchymal abnormality or pleural effusion.\n\nThe 'Clinical picture of acute pulmonary embolism. Relations to the degree of vascular obstruction' document mentions that a high pulmonary pressure correlated with long duration of symptoms and a high number of embolic episodes.\n\nFrom these findings, we can conclude that signs related to pulmonary arterial hypertension would be more likely present in patients with chronic thromboembolism or those who have had longer duration of symptoms and a higher number of embolic episodes. The most specific indicator of pulmonary arterial hypertension on physical examination would be an increased jugular venous pressure.\",\n\"answer_choice\": A"]
