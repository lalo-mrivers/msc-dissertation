["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The primary motor cortex is responsible for controlling movements of the body. The studies reviewed describe the relations of single-cell activity in central motor structures to complex visuomotor tasks and document the fact that various cortical areas process visuomotor information in parallel. The somatotopic mapping of the primary motor cortex shows that each motor task can be localized to a predictable site on a coronal section containing the precentral gyrus, with reproducible foci of CBF increases in the motor cortex in every subject. Additionally, operant control of single neurons in monkey motor cortex and intracortical microstimulation study of output organization in precentral cortex of awake primates provide evidence that primary motor cortex activity results in contralateral movement.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
