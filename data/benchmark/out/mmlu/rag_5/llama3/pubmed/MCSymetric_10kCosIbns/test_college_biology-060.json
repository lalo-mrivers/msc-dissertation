["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the formation of the earliest cells. The provided documents talk about early developmental stages of amphibian embryos and embryonic recapitulation. In the document 'Pattern formation in early developmental stages of amphibian embryos', it is mentioned that an internal factor determines the endoderm and mesoderm anlage, which suggests that the earliest cells may have been formed through the action of this factor. This implies that the plasma membrane might be the component that arose first, as the induction of the neural plate seems to be mediated by a membrane mechanism.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
