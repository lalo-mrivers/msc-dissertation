["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The simulation study of oscillating glycolysis provides a detailed knowledge of the component structure (enzyme kinetics, metabolite pattern) of glycolysis. The model is based on substrate inhibition of glyceraldehydephosphatedehydrigenase (GAPDH) with glyceraldehydephosphate (GAP). Pyrimidinenucleotides (NADplus and NADH) are shown not to play an important role in the given oscillation mechanism. The mathematical model presented for human erythrocyte glycolysis takes into account ATP-synthesis and -consumption. A set of three differential equations describes the steady states and the time-dependent changes of the metabolite concentrations under blood storage conditions. For a given parameter combination there are in general three stationary points of the system, one of which is unstable. The heat production of human erythrocytes was measured on a flow microcalorimeter with simultaneous analyses of lactate and other metabolites.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
