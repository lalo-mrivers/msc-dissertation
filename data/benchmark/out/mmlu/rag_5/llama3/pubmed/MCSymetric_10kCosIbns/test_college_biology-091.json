["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Phalloidin is a toxin that binds to actin subunits and disrupts actin function. Actin polymerization is promoted by phalloidin, which suggests that it affects microfilaments (C). The document also mentions the interaction of phalloidin with muscle actin, promoting actin polymerization and stabilizing actin polymers. This further supports the idea that phalloidin primarily affects microfilaments.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
