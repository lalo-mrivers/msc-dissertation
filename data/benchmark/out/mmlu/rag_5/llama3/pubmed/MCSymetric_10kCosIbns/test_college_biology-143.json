["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the symplastic pathway for sucrose movement from mesophyll cells to phloem. The provided documents describe various plant metabolic processes, including photosynthesis and sugar transport. However, they do not specifically mention the location of sucrose synthesis or its movement through the plant. Therefore, we need to rely on general knowledge of plant anatomy and physiology to answer this question. In angiosperms, sucrose is synthesized in mesophyll cells during photosynthesis and then moves into the phloem for transport to other parts of the plant. The symplastic pathway refers to the movement of substances through the cell's cytoplasm and plasmodesmata (small channels that connect adjacent cells). In this context, the symplastic pathway for sucrose movement from mesophyll cells to phloem involves the following cells: companion cells, phloem parenchyma, and sieve tube.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
