["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the type of mutation that causes achondroplasia. According to the clinical observation of achondroplasia, familial vertical transmissions were noted in only 12% of patients, suggesting that most cases are new mutations rather than inherited. This implies that the effect of these mutations is more likely to be dominant negative or loss-of-function, as dominant positive and gain-of-function mutations would be expected to be more frequent if they were inherited.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A: dominant negative\""]
