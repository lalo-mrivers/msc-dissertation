["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's mother is concerned that the 16-year-old girl may have contracted meningitis from her soccer teammate who was diagnosed with meningococcal meningitis. The patient feels well but is concerned she may have 'caught the same bug'. Medical history is remarkable for asthma and medications include inhaled albuterol. Vital signs are normal, physical examination shows no abnormalities. Therefore, the patient does not exhibit symptoms of bacterial meningitis. However, as a precautionary measure, it would be important to evaluate her risk of contracting the disease. The fact that she shared a hotel room with the girl who was hospitalized increases her risk. So, we need to consider her exposure to endotoxin release and the host inflammatory response.\n\nThe documents highlight the importance of reducing the host inflammatory response through anti-inflammatory agents such as dexamethasone. However, this is not relevant in this case as the patient does not exhibit symptoms. Antibiotics are currently the specific medical therapy for bacterial meningitis, but since the patient does not have symptoms, it would be premature to administer antibiotics.\n\nThe documents also highlight the importance of considering the biochemical basis of disease at the cellular and subcellular levels. The patient's exposure to endotoxin release increases her risk of contracting bacterial meningitis. Therefore, we need to consider her risk factors for developing this disease.\n\nAccording to the documents, patients who received dexamethasone became afebrile earlier and were less likely to acquire deafness after bacterial meningitis. However, this is not relevant in this case as the patient does not exhibit symptoms.\n\nThe main study purpose of the analyzed pediatric patients with aseptic meningitis was the evaluation of clinical presentation, diagnostic workup, course and prognosis of this disease entity. The documents highlight that aseptic meningitis in children is relatively benign, and underline the importance of rest and relaxation during convalescence. However, this is not relevant in this case as the patient does not have symptoms.\n\nThe Role of viral-bacterial associations in meningitis in children highlights the etiology of the process was determined on the basis of characteristic structural changes in the CNS and other organs, findings of virological and bacteriological investigations. In the majority of children the intravascular blood coagulation was observed. However, this is not relevant in this case as the patient does not exhibit symptoms.\n\nBased on the above considerations, it is clear that the most appropriate intervention for this patient at this time would be to administer the meningococcal vaccine.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
