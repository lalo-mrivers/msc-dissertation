["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has atrial fibrillation with a narrow QRS complex. He was given metoprolol earlier to slow down his pulse, but it increased his pulse instead. The goal is to decrease the patient's pulse. Metoprolol can increase heart rate in patients with atrial fibrillation and narrow QRS complexes. Digoxin is not effective in increasing the heart rate of patients with atrial fibrillation. Enalapril is an ACE inhibitor that can lower blood pressure but does not directly affect the heart rate. Lidocaine is a class IB anti-arrhythmic agent that can increase or decrease heart rate depending on the patient's condition. Based on these considerations, metoprolol would not be effective in decreasing the patient's pulse.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C: Lidocaine\"\n}"]
