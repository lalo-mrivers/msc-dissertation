["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Anaerobic metabolism refers to the generation of ATP. In the provided documents, anaerobic energy-yielding reactions are mentioned as being mediated by phosphorylated compounds. Additionally, the study on efficiency of anaerobic work shows that anaerobic ATP synthesis is not less efficient than aerobic ATP synthesis. This suggests that anaerobic metabolism generates ATP without the use of oxygen (option C).\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
