["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents discuss various aspects of drug administration, including the effects of slow IV flow rates and distal injection sites on actual rates of drug delivery. The texts also describe methods for calculating infusion rates and establishing steady state drug concentrations. Given these details, we can conclude that IV administration allows titration of a drug with its desired effect (choice C). This is evident from the general theory for rapidly establishing steady state drug concentrations using two consecutive constant rate intravenous infusions.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
