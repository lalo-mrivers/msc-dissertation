["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to the provided documents, mouse gamete adhesion molecules play a crucial role in fertilization. The mZP3 glycoprotein is a primary sperm receptor located on the surface of mouse eggs and supports species-specific interactions between sperm and eggs that lead to gamete fusion. Upon binding to ZP3, sperm undergo the acrosome reaction, which enables them to penetrate the zona pellucida and fertilize the egg.\n\nSince the question asks about experimental observations expected to be seen when injecting or incubating with antibodies that bind to ZP3, it is important to understand how these experiments affect the sperm's ability to bind to the ZP3 glycoprotein.\n\nFrom the provided documents, we know that purified mouse ZP3 inhibits sperm binding and induces the acrosome reaction. Therefore, it can be inferred that blocking or inhibiting the binding of ZP3 to its receptors on the sperm surface would prevent fertilization from occurring.\n\nFurthermore, the presence of antibodies that bind to ZP3 on the egg surface is expected to interfere with the binding of sperm to ZP3 and thereby block fertilization. This suggests that options A, B, and C are all expected experimental observations.\n\nFinally, option D refers to an experiment involving a different glycoprotein (ZP2) and does not directly relate to the question about ZP3. Therefore, it is unlikely that this observation would be related to the blockage of fertilization due to ZP3 binding.\", \n\"answer_choice\": C"]
