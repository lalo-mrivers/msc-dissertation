["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the effect of a mutation that prevents binding of the repressor to lactose on the expression of lac operon genes, we need to consider how the repressor normally regulates gene expression. The repressor binds to lactose and prevents transcription initiation by blocking RNA polymerase from accessing the promoter region. When lactose is present, the repressor-lactose complex forms, which inhibits transcription. Therefore, a mutation that prevents binding of the repressor to lactose would likely result in constitutive expression of the lac operon genes.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
