["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents provided mainly focus on geographical dimensions of terrestrial net and gross primary productivity, the Miami Model predicting net primary productivity from environmental parameters, biophysical questions in ecology and environmental research, human adaptation to climatic changes, a model of an ecosystem closed as regards gas metabolism, and environmental concerns. The question is about why net primary productivity tends to increase toward the tropics. Upon reviewing the documents, I found that the Miami Model (Lieth, 1973, 1975) is presented predicting net primary productivity from temperature and precipitation. This suggests that temperature plays a crucial role in determining net primary productivity. Additionally, one of the documents emphasizes the importance of warm temperatures in fostering photosynthesis. Therefore, I conclude that C: The availability of water and warm temperatures in the tropics fosters photosynthesis is the best explanation for why net primary productivity tends to increase toward the tropics.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
