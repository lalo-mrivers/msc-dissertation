["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The concept of keystone species is not explicitly mentioned in the provided documents. However, we can infer some information about their effects on ecological communities from the mathematical model of a two-level ecosystem and the geochemical ecology paper.\n\nFrom the mathematical model, we can see that the interaction between predator and prey species plays a crucial role in determining the structure and composition of ecosystems. This suggests that keystone species, which are often characterized as having disproportionate impacts on their environments, could have profound effects on the structure and composition of ecological communities.\n\nIn the geochemical ecology paper, we can see that biogeochemical cycles and thresholds play important roles in determining the state of health or disease in organisms. This could be related to the concept of keystone species, as these species may have a disproportionate impact on their environments, leading to changes in biogeochemical cycles and thresholds.\n\nGiven this information, we can infer that keystone species are likely to have profound effects on the structure and composition of ecological communities because they\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
