["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the provided documents, we can see that free fatty acids are transported in the blood. In the study 'Quantitative evaluation of the maternal-fetal transfer of free fatty acids in the rat', it is mentioned that 0.19 mu-mol fatty acids/min pass into the fetuses from the maternal circulation, indicating that free fatty acids are transferred from the mother to the fetus through the bloodstream. Similarly, in the study 'Application of tracers in studying free fatty acid metabolism of various organs in vivo', labeled palmitate or oleate is used to study substrate utilization under in vivo conditions, suggesting that free fatty acids are transported in the blood. Therefore, we can conclude that most of the free fatty acids are transported in the blood.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
