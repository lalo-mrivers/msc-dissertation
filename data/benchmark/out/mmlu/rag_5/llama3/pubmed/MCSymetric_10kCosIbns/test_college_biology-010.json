["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe various types of cell division patterns. Based on the description of early embryos having orthogonal succession of division planes, it is likely that the question refers to a type of cleavage symmetry. The spatial patterns of cells in dividing epithelia also mention orientations of division planes being all the same but are orthogonal to those in the preceding generation. This pattern suggests oblique angle to the polar axis, which is consistent with meroblastic cleavage.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
