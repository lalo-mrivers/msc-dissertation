["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The given information suggests that the girl is healthy and has no other abnormalities. The systolic ejection murmur is grade 2/6 along the upper left sternal border, which is characteristic of functional murmurs. The soft mid-diastolic murmur along the lower left sternal border could be due to a flow murmur or a mitral valve prolapse. Since there are no other abnormalities and the child is otherwise healthy, we can rule out coarctation of the aorta and aortic stenosis as they would typically present with more significant cardiovascular findings. An atrial septal defect may not produce a systolic ejection murmur. Therefore, considering these factors, mitral valve prolapse or a flow murmur due to a cardiac anomaly seem like possible explanations.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
