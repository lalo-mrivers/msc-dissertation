["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about song development in birds. It mentions that a young male reared in isolation hears only the song of a different bird species and develops an adult song repertoire that lacks certain characteristics typical of his own species. This suggests that the song of his species is not solely learned during development or entirely instinctive. Instead, it implies that there may be some influence from the heard song of the other species. The relevant documents discuss the role of auditory feedback in canary song development and the developmental plasticity in neural circuits controlling birdsong. They suggest that sensory templates play a role in shaping song characteristics. Therefore, it is likely that the song of his species is dependent on the auditory feedback he received during development.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"]
