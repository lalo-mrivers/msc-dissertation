["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the location of proprioceptive nerve endings in synovial joints. In the provided documents, we can find information about the ultrastructure of the synovial membrane and the different structures that make it up. The normal synovial membrane as seen by electron microscopy is bordered by one to three layers of lining cells. One type of cell with mixed properties probably produces synovial hyaluronic acid. Other identified synovial structures include fibrocytes, macrophages, lymphatics, mast cells, non-myelinated nerves, and fat.\n\nAccording to the document '[Histologic, morphometric study of the human synovial membrane]', villi have fenestrated capillaries and are covered by A- and AB-synoviocytes. Villi are regarded as the areas where synovia is produced. The fibrous type of the synovial membrane is mostly smooth surfaced and seems to be an ordinary fibrous connective tissue.\n\nThe relevant information about proprioceptive nerve endings can be found in the document 'Physiology of normal and abnormal synovium'. According to this, non-myelinated nerves are one of the identified synovial structures. These nerves are probably responsible for the proprioception of the joint.\", \"answer_choice\": A}"]
