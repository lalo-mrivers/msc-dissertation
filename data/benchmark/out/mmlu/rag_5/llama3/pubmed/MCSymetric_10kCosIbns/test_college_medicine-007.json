["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the interaction between diisopropylfluorophosphate (DFP) and acetylcholinesterase (ACE). DFP binds to the active site of ACE in the synapses of neurons, rendering the enzyme permanently inactive. This makes DFP a potent toxin. Considering the information from the provided documents, it can be inferred that DFP irreversibly inhibits ACE, as it is described as 'permanently inactive'. Therefore, the correct answer is C: Irreversible inhibition.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
