["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the growth and development of the mandible. The first document discusses the osteo-neural relation and how it affects the shape and size of the mandible. The second document describes the translative growth of the rat mandible, showing that the growth in length doubles the growth in breadth. The third document focuses on the osseous structure of the ramus of the mandible and its significance in clinical settings. The fourth document discusses occluso-articular functional diagnosis and the measurement of dimensional behavior during movement. The fifth document presents a study on the bias axis stress-strain relationship of the human mandible, revealing it to be a living, anisotropic, and nonhomogeneous composite biomaterial.
