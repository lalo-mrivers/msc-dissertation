["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the initial product of glycogen breakdown in muscle. From the provided documents, we can see that glycogen breakdown results in an increase in glycolytic intermediates such as glucose 6-phosphate, fructose 6-phosphate, and lactate. The study by McDermott et al. (1987) J Appl Physiol 63:1275-1283 mentions that similar decrements in muscle glycogen levels were observed in both non-exercising and exercising muscles at the end of the 90-min exercise bout. An increase in tissue lactate concentrations occurred in both non-exercising and exercising muscle, although only slight changes in the glycolytic intermediates occurred. This suggests that glycogen breakdown initially results in the formation of glucose-6-phosphate.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
