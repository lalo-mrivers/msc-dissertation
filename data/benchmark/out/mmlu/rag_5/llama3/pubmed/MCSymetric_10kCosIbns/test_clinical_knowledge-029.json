["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant information that suggests how lactate and hydrogen ions leave the muscle can be found in the document 'Comparison of efflux rates of hydrogen and lactate ions from isolated muscles in vitro'. According to this study, it is evident that the rate of efflux of hydrogen ions exceeded that of lactate ions by factors of about 14 and 50 in the case of diaphragm and sartorius muscles respectively. This suggests that there is a difference observed in the efflux kinetics of hydrogen and lactate ions. Therefore, it is not likely that both lactate and hydrogen ions leave the muscle via simple diffusion.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
