["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the activity of creatine kinase. According to the documents, muscle creatine kinase is a regulated allosteric enzyme, which means its activity can be influenced by various factors. The document on allosteric properties shows that the enzyme's activity increases 3-4-fold with protein dilution, but this effect is not observed in the presence of inhibitors to FDP and PEP. Additionally, the document on Influence of Ca2+ ions and cation chelators shows that EDTA and EGTA stimulate the activity of creatine kinase by suppressing the inhibitory effect of Ca2+ ions.\n\nFrom these findings, it can be inferred that the activity of creatine kinase is affected by various factors such as protein dilution, inhibitors, and Ca2+ ions. Therefore, option A: increased when intracellular ADP rises, seems a plausible explanation.\",\n\"answer_choice\": A"]
