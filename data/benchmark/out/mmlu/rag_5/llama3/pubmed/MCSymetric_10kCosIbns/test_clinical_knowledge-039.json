["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks for the rate of energy expenditure given the mean rate of oxygen consumption. We can use one of the provided documents to find the relationship between oxygen consumption and energy expenditure. In 'A simple relation between performance in running and maximal aerobic power', we are told that the cost of running is about 1 cal per m covered and per kg of body weight. This document also provides a nomogram for calculating the time employed to cover a given distance based on VO2 (ml/min/kg) and the energy from glycolysis assumed to be about equal to the energy from oxidations in 1 min.\n\nFrom this information, we can calculate the rate of energy expenditure by multiplying the oxygen consumption with the caloric equivalent of oxygen. The caloric equivalent is approximately 20 kJ/l.\n\nFor a male athlete with a mean rate of oxygen consumption of 2 l/min, the rate of energy expenditure would be:\n\n2 l/min * 20 kJ/l = 40 kJ/min\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
