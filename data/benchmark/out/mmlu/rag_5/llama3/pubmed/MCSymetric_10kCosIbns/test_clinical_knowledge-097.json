["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about peripheral muscle fatigue during multiple sprint activities. The relevant documents are related to fatigue and ATP, creatine phosphate, and lactate during a 400-m sprint. In this study, it was found that after 200 m the speed of running decreased, although CP was not depleted and lactate concentration was not at maximum level. Complete fatigue occurred when CP stores were depleted and B-La and M-La attained an individual maximum. This suggests that peripheral mechanisms play a role in muscle fatigue. The documents also mention that local factors in the muscle, primarily in fast twitch (FT) muscle fibres, were causing the development of fatigue during repeated dynamic contractions with high power outputs.\",\n\"answer_choice\": A\n}"]
