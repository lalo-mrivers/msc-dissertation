["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about bronchial breathing. The relevant documents describe various effects on breathing patterns, such as hypercapnia, hypoxia, exercise, and anxiety. None of these effects directly describe the characteristics of bronchial breathing. However, we can infer that bronchial breathing may be related to changes in lung volumes, airway resistance, and flow/volume curves, as described in the first document. The second document mentions unilateral bronchography and ventilatory function, but does not specifically address bronchial breathing. The third document discusses the effects of hypercapnia, hypoxia, exercise, and anxiety on breathing patterns, but does not provide information about bronchial breathing. Therefore, we must rely on general knowledge of respiratory physiology to answer this question. Bronchial breathing is typically characterized by a longer inspiratory phase and a shorter expiratory phase, with a gap between expiration and inspiration.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
