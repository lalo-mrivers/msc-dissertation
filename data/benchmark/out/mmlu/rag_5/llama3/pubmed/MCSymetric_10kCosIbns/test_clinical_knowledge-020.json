["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about what a Colles fracture is. The relevant documents mention Colles fracture multiple times, but don't explicitly define it. However, the name 'Colles fracture' suggests that it might be related to the wrist or radius and ulna bones. Upon reviewing the documents again, I found that one of them mentions a technique for treating Colles fractures using plaster with radial and dorsal indentations, which is applied in 130 patients. This indicates that a Colles fracture occurs at the wrist.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
