["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents discuss reflexes and neurology, specifically the elicitation of reflexes and their interpretation. The 'Reflexes and neurologists' article reviews aspects of reflex action, mentioning George Bruyn's breadth of interests. The other articles focus on the motor output to agonist and antagonist muscles during intentional forearm flexion movements, studying muscle spindles as the source of reflex changes. These studies demonstrate that sensory input affects motor output. There is no specific mention of arm reflexes or their assessment in these documents. However, considering the context of reflexology and neurology, we can infer that arm reflexes are likely evaluated similarly to other reflexes, with consideration of muscle spindles and sensory input.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
