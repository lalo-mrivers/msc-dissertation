["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about determining the Doppler shift in perceived sound frequency. The key concept here is the Doppler effect, which is related to ultrasound or electromagnetic energy reflected from moving scatters. The Doppler bandwidth is defined as the frequency difference between the extrema of the echo power spectrum. To determine the Doppler shift in perceived sound frequency, we need to consider the variables that affect the Doppler effect. Speed of sound in a medium (I) and frequency of emitted sound (IV) are crucial parameters. The time of interaction between sound source and detector (II) is also important, but it's not directly related to determining the Doppler shift. Distance between source and detector (III) does not affect the Doppler effect.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: I and IV\"\n}"]
