["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The provided documents discuss familial cancer syndromes characterized by a high degree of genetic heterogeneity. The specific types of hereditary cancers can be identified by focusing on the histologic types and sites of involvement, not only of the primary neoplasm, but also of associated neoplasms and associated conditions or stigmata, as well as by focusing on the age of the patient at the time of diagnosis, tumor localization and frequency, and the mode of inheritance.
