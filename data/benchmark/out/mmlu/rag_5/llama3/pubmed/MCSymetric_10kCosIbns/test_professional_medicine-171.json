["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question describes a male stillborn delivered at 32 weeks' gestation with oligohydramnios. The absence of a urethral opening is noted. This combination suggests an abnormality in the urinary tract. Given that vesicorectal fistula and anal-urethral atresia can cause oligohydramnios, we should look for findings consistent with these conditions. In the case report on oligohydramnios and megacolon in a fetus with vesicorectal fistula and anal-urethral atresia, severe oligohydramnios and extremely dilated bowel filled with hyperechogenic material floating in fluid were found in a fetus at 27 weeks' gestation. This suggests that the stillborn may have had a similar condition.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
