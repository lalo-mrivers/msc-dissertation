["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The provided documents describe the developmental stages of human embryos, including the structure of a 17-day-old embryo. This information can be used to understand the general development of a vertebrate organism from zygote stage to fetus. The concept 'ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny' is often discussed in embryology. It suggests that an embryo's developmental stages reflect its evolutionary history, with early developmental stages resembling those of more primitive species. Since the documents do not specifically address this topic, we can assume that the question is asking about general conclusions that can be drawn from studying embryonic development.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
