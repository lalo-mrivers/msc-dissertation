["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The problem involves the Doppler effect and frequency shifting due to motion. We need to consider the velocity of the sound source (actor inside the car) and the camera platform. The key equation is v = f * lambda, where v is the perceived frequency, f is the original frequency (800Hz), and lambda is the wavelength.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the wavelength: lambda = 331 meters / sec (speed of sound) / f = 0.4135 meters for our case.\n\nNow, let's consider the relative velocity between the camera platform and the actor inside the car: delta v = 108 km/h + 72 km/h = 180 km/h or approximately 50 m/s.\n\nUsing the Doppler effect formula: v = f * lambda / (lambda - delta v), we get:\n\nv = 800 Hz * 0.4135 meters / ((0.4135) - (50 m/s)) â‰ˆ 787 Hz\n\nSo, the perceived frequency picked up by the camera is approximately 787 Hz.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
