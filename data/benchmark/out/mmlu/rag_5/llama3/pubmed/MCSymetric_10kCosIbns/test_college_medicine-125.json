["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the mechanism by which H+ returns to the inside of the mitochondria. The relevant documents discuss energy transfer in mitochondrial synthesis of ATP and stoichiometric relationship between energy-dependent proton ejection and electron transport in mitochondria. It appears that the electron transport chain generates a positive gradient of H+ ions outside the membrane, which then passes back through ATP synthase. This is an active process requiring energy.\", \"answer_choice\": C}"]
