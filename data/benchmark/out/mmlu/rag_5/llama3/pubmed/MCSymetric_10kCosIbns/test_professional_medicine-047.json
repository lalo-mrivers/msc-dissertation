["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about changes in Starling forces during a study of renal glomeruli. The relevant information is that the afferent arterial pressure is constant at 100 mm Hg and the efferent arteriole is constricted with a vascular clamp. This constriction will increase the resistance in the efferent arteriole, which will lead to an increase in hydrostatic pressure in the glomerular capillaries. Therefore, the most likely change in Starling forces is an increased hydrostatic pressure.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
