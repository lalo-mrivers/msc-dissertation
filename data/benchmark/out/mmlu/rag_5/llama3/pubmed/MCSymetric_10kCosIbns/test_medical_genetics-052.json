["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about Positional Cloning. The relevant document is 'From linked marker to gene. An area of increasing importance in human genetics research is the strategy of 'reverse genetics' or 'positional cloning', whereby a gene associated with a genetic disease is isolated on the basis of its approximate chromosomal position.' This indicates that Positional Cloning refers to mapping a gene to a chromosomal region and then identifying and cloning a genomic copy of the gene from the region.\", \"answer_choice\": D}"]
