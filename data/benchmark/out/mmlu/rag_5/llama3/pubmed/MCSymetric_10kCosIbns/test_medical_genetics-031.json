["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"In a Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, we know that the genotype frequency of heterozygotes is determined by the frequencies of the two alleles. Since the frequencies of the two alleles are 0.6 and 0.4, we can use the Hardy-Weinberg equation to calculate the genotype frequency of heterozygotes. The equation is p^2 + 2pq + q^2, where p is the frequency of one allele and q is the frequency of the other allele. Plugging in the values, we get (0.6)^2 + 2(0.6)(0.4) + (0.4)^2 = 0.36 + 0.48 + 0.16 = 0.64.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
