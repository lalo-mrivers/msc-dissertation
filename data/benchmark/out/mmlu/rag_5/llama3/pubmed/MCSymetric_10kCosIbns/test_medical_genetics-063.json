["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about an Hfr strain of E. coli, which is a type of F' plasmid that can replicate extrachromosomally. According to the documents, F' plasmids from HfrH and HfrC cultures of Escherichia coli have been isolated and characterized. This suggests that Hfr strains contain F' plasmids. The F factor is a bacterial chromosome with its own replication origin. Therefore, an Hfr strain of E. coli contains a bacterial chromosome with the F factor inserted.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
