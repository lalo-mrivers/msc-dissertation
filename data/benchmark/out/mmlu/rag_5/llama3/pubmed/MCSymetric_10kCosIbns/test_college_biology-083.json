["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking how ornithine is regenerated during each turn of the urea cycle. Ornithine is involved in citrulline synthesis, which is stimulated by mitochondrial respiration. In the provided documents, it is mentioned that ammonia and ornithine increase the oxygen uptake and the formation of citrulline in isolated rat liver mitochondria. This suggests that ornithine is regenerated through citrulline synthesis, which is a part of the urea cycle. Therefore, the answer should be related to citric acid cycle.\", \"answer_choice\": B}"]
