["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents describe different approaches to accessing the infraorbital nerve. The method described in [Technic and evaluation of effectiveness of infraorbital anesthesia using the approach along the axis of the 2d premolar] achieves sufficient depth of anaesthesia. The study [Motor impairment following blockade of the infraorbital nerve: implications for the use of anesthetization techniques in speech research] finds that anesthesia of the infraorbital nerve produces measurable motor weakness in the supraoral musculature. This suggests that the infraorbital nerve has a role in motor control, rather than just sensory function. The study [Mid-facial sensation following craniofacial surgery] finds that the function of the infraorbital nerve is largely undisturbed by elective procedures. Considering these findings, it is likely that a successful infraorbital nerve block will produce anaesthesia of the upper lip and anterior labial gingivae.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
