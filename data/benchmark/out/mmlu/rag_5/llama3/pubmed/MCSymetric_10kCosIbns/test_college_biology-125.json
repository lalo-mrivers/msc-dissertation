["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about adaptations that would limit pollination by bees (Apis mellifera) and promote hummingbird pollination. Bees are attracted to flowers with high sugar concentration produced in limited amounts, so an adaptation that provides a different type of nectar or reduces the availability of nectar could limit bee pollination. Hummingbirds, on the other hand, are attracted to flowers with red coloration and pendant (hanging) shape. Therefore, modifications that make the flowers less attractive to bees and more attractive to hummingbirds would be suitable.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
