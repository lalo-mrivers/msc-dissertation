["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The concept of metabolic deviations suggests that metabolism is about systems, where a change in one unit affects the flow of matter, energy or information to other units. The whole system participates in this chain reaction. This implies that metabolism is not determined by a single factor like the size of proteins, but rather by complex interactions between multiple components. Additionally, the text discusses the role of drug-metabolizing enzymes and their involvement in controlling the steady state levels of ligands involved in growth, homeostasis, differentiation, and neuroendocrine functions. This suggests that metabolism is influenced by factors beyond simple protein composition.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C\n}"]
