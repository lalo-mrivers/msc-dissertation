["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking where the sinoatrial node is located. The documents provided describe the electrical activity in the region of the sino-atrial node in dogs and humans. It seems that the researchers have identified landmarks to locate the sino-atrial node in both species. In the dog, it was found after thoracotomy using a unipolar electrode placed in the epicardium at the cavo-atrial junction area. In humans, it was directly recorded through the right subclavian vein. The location of the sino-atrial node is not explicitly stated to be between any specific cardiac chambers or walls.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
