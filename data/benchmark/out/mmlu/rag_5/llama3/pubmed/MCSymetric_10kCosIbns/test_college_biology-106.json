["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about embryonic cleavage. The relevant documents are about human embryo development, but there is no specific information about yolk or telolecithal eggs. However, the document 'Evaluation of the synchronism of cleavage divisions' talks about estimating the degree of asynchronism of cell divisions in individual embryos at early developmental stages by means of a relative measure of asynchronism. This implies that cleavage occurs during early embryonic development. There is no mention of the presence of yolk inhibiting cleavage, so option A seems incorrect. The same applies to options B and C, which seem unrelated to the provided information. Therefore, it's possible that option D is not true.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
