["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with a 3-day history of fever, sore throat, and itchy eyes. He recently returned from a summer camp where there was an outbreak of similar symptoms among the other campers and volunteers. This suggests that the cause might be contagious. The symptoms are also consistent with viral infections such as adenovirus or Epstein-Barr virus. However, influenza virus is less likely given that the patient's temperature is not extremely high and the symptoms do not suggest a severe respiratory illness.
