["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant studies suggest that sodium bicarbonate ingestion increases blood bicarbonate levels, which is associated with increased performance during anaerobic exercise of longer durations (120-240 s). There is no evidence to support the idea that sodium bicarbonate ingestion affects pH and buffering capacity of the extracellular fluid or muscle pH. Therefore, options A, C, and D are not supported by the provided studies.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
