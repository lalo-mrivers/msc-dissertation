["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the status of chromosome mapping in humans. The provided documents discuss various aspects of chromosome mapping, including the methods used, the current state of the map, and its applications. From these discussions, it can be inferred that the number of gene loci is known to be around 210, with each locus localized to a specific chromosome. This information comes from studies in families and somatic cell hybrids. The knowledge gained from the chromosome map has implications for understanding evolution, chromosomal organization, and the pathogenesis of diseases. Additionally, the map is useful in prenatal or premorbid diagnosis of hereditary diseases.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
