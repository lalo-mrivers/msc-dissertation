["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 15-year-old boy who presents to the emergency department with symptoms of headache, dizziness, nausea, and vomiting after playing full-contact football. He is diaphoretic, has a temperature of 39.5°C (103.1°F), pulse of 120/min, respirations of 40/min, and blood pressure of 90/65 mm Hg. The patient is not oriented to person, place, or time. The most likely cause of these symptoms is heat stroke, which is a common condition seen in athletes participating in high-intensity activities during hot weather.\n\nGiven the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, the most appropriate next step in management would be to administer intravenous fluids to help cool the body down and prevent further complications. This is supported by the American College of Sports Medicine guidelines for heat stroke treatment, which recommend IV fluid administration as the first line of therapy.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
