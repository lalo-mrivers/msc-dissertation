["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the shape and function of the diaphragm. The first document describes the three-dimensional form of the diaphragm and its total surface area, right and left surface areas, and principal radii of curvature as a function of height. The second document discusses the permeability of the diaphragm and fluid resorption from the peritoneal cavity in rats. The third document investigates the influence of lung volume and electrode position on electromyography of the diaphragm. The fourth document explores regional deformation of the canine diaphragm. None of these documents mention the separation of cavities by the diaphragm, except for the functional importance of a highly elastic ligament on the mammalian diaphragm, which describes the diaphragm as separating the thoracic and abdominal cavities.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
