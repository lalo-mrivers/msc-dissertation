["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for statements about plant embryogenesis that are incorrect. We need to carefully review the given documents related to plant embryogenesis. In 'Pattern formation in the flowering plant embryo', it is mentioned that precursors of all three plant tissue systems (shoot apical meristem, root apical meristem and leaf primordia) are formed during embryogenesis. Therefore, option D 'Precursors of all three plant tissue systems are formed during embryogenesis.' is correct, not incorrect. So, we need to find the correct answer from the given options.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
