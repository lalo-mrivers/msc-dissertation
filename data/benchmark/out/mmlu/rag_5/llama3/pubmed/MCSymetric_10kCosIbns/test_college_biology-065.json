["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the Golgi apparatus of a eukaryote. The relevant documents describe the structure and function of the Golgi apparatus in rat liver cells. From these descriptions, we can infer that the Golgi apparatus has multiple compartments or cisternae, each with distinct enzyme activities and lipid compositions. The document on similarities between the Golgi apparatus membrane and plasma membrane suggests that there is a close relationship between the two, possibly mediated by transfer of membrane-bound vesicles. This information does not explicitly describe the orientation of the Golgi apparatus in the cytoplasm, but it does suggest continuity among its cisternae. The document on biochemical studies also describes the partition patterns of marker enzymes and suggests that these enzymes are inherently associated with the Golgi apparatus.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
