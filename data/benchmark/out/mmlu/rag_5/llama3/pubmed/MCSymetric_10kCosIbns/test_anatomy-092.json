["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about laryngeal oedema being confined to the larynx above the vocal folds. We can look for relevant information in the documents that talks about the anatomy of the larynx and the causes of edema. In 'Surgery of cancer of the larynx...' we see a discussion of the risks and complications of surgery, including respiratory failure which could lead to oedema. However, it does not specifically address why oedema is confined above the vocal folds. In 'Diseases of the larynx...' there is no relevant information about oedema or its confinement. 'Oncocytic papillary cystadenomatosis of the larynx...' and '[Mucoepidermoid cancer of the larynx...]' are case reports that do not provide any specific information about edema. Finally, in 'Early diagnostic signs and symptoms of laryngeal disease...' we find a discussion of early symptoms and signs of laryngeal disease, including changes that could lead to oedema. It is here that we find the relevant information. The text states that fluid will drain rapidly into the thorax below the vocal folds, which means that fluid accumulation above the vocal folds would be more likely due to its confinement to the mucosa above the vocal folds being more vascular than that below.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
