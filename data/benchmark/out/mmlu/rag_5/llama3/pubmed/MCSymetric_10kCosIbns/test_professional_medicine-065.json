["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms are acute onset of shortness of breath, cyanosis, unresponsiveness, and later bleeding from multiple sites. The fetal heart rate was previously reactive with no decelerations. This suggests a sudden and severe event affecting the mother rather than the fetus. The patient has mild asthma treated with inhaled bronchodilators, which is not life-threatening at this point. Intrapartum complications such as umbilical cord prolapse or placental abruption can cause such symptoms but are unlikely given the reactive fetal heart rate and the lack of decelerations. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is amniotic fluid embolism, which is a known complication of labor that can present with these symptoms.\", \"answer_choice\": A}"]
