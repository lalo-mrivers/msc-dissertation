["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To find the complementary DNA sequence, we need to consider the base pairing rules. The given DNA strand is 5' CGA TTG 3'. We can start by matching the bases: C in the original sequence pairs with G, G pairs with C, A pairs with T, and T pairs with A. Then, we move from the 5' end to the 3' end and apply the base pairing rules: C-G, G-C, A-T, and T-A. Finally, we get the complementary DNA sequence.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
