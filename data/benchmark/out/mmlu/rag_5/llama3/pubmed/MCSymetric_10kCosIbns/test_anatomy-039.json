["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the organ that removes bilirubin from blood. The relevant documents mention that unconjugated bilirubin dissocates from albumin in the liver cells and binds to cytoplasmic proteins Y (or ligandin) and Z, then it's converted to a water-soluble ester glucuronide by bilirubin UDP-glucuronyl transferase. This process is energy-dependent and occurs against a concentration gradient. Therefore, the organ that removes bilirubin from blood must be the liver.\", \"answer_choice\": C}"]
