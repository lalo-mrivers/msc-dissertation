["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about a fluorescent molecule of 1,000 daltons entering an adjacent cell. This suggests that the molecule is small enough to pass through a gap between cells. In the provided documents, there is no direct mention of desmosomes or tight junctions being permeable to molecules of this size. However, it is mentioned in 'Retention of susceptibility to mitogens after direct dansylation of viable human lymphocytes' that normal human lymphocytes may be rendered permeable to deoxynucleoside triphosphates. This implies that there are channels or pathways that allow molecules to pass between cells. Given the size of the molecule and the context, I believe it is most likely that the fluorescent molecule entered the adjacent cell through a gap junction.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
