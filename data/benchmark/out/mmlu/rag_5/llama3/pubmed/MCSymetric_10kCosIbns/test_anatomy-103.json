["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks which bones develop by endochondral ossification. From the given documents, we know that endochondral ossification is a process where cartilage is replaced by bone tissue. In the document 'On the morphology of the terminal microvasculature during endochondral ossification in rats', it is mentioned that the terminal vasculature during endochondral ossification proved to be a labyrinth of interconnected sinusoidal complexes with bulbous buds invading the chondrocyte cavities of the growth plate. This suggests that endochondral ossification occurs at sites where cartilage is present. In 'The initial stages of formation of the bone centers and the construction of the skeletal organs', it is mentioned that the organ of growth for diaphysis is the epiphyseal disk, which acts firstly as growing cartilage. This also suggests that endochondral ossification occurs at sites where cartilage is present. Therefore, we can conclude that bones that develop by endochondral ossification are those that have a cartilaginous precursor tissue.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D: The ribs, sternum, clavicle and vertebrae\"}"]
