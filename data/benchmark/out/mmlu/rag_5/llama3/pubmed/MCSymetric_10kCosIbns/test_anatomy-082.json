["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) circulation around the brain. The 'third circulation' refers to the CSF flow between the cerebral aqueduct and the spinal canal. In the cerebral aqueduct, CSF flow begins 200 ms after the R-wave of the ECG and simulates an arterial pulse wave pattern. This suggests that CSF circulates between the third ventricle and the fourth ventricle, followed by backflow from the fourth to the third ventricle.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
