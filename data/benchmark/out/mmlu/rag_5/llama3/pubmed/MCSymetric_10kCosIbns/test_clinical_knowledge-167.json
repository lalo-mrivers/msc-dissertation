["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking which molecule does not form part of DNA. The given options are Purine, Pyrimidine, Deoxyribose, and Amino acid. Let's analyze the documents: [Symmetry of single-stranded DNA molecules] talks about symmetry groups of a single strand DNA molecule, but doesn't mention specific molecules. [Chemical synthesis of restriction enzyme recognition sites useful for cloning] discusses chemical synthesis of decameric DNA's, which are substrates for restriction enzymes. [Design and applications of single and double stranded DNA analogs] is about synthesizing modified DNA-duplexes, including oligonucleotide derivatives. [Formation of phosphonester bonds catalyzed by DNA polymerase] talks about the synthesis of compounds incorporated into DNA chains during catalysis by reverse transcriptases and DNA polymerases. Finally, [Some implications of an alternative structure for DNA] discusses a space-filling model of an alternative structure for DNA. None of these documents mention Amino acid as part of DNA. Therefore, we can conclude that Amino acid is the molecule that does not form part of DNA.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
