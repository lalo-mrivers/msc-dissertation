["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents discuss enzyme activity and regulation. Enzyme activity is influenced by the kinetic behavior of an enzyme, which can be rationally interpreted only in terms of metabolic function and structural features of the enzyme molecule. The Briggs-Haldane two-step irreversible kinetic model is used to understand optimal enzymic activity. The paper highlights that enzymes must not only be effective catalysts but also be part of sophisticated regulatory systems. This indicates that environmental factors, such as temperature and pH, can affect enzyme activity.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: All of the above.\""]
