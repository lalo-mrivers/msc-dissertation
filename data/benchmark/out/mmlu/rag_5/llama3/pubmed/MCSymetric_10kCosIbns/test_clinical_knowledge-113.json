["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for the strength of Adrenaline that is equivalent to Adrenaline 1 in 1000. The provided documents describe various studies on adrenaline administration and its effects on plasma concentrations, metabolic responses, and cardiohaemodynamic parameters. One of these studies describes the determination of (-)-adrenaline in certain formulations containing adrenaline hydrogen tartrate at concentrations down to 0.18 mg ml-1 (1:10 000 adrenaline). This suggests that 1:1000 is equivalent to 0.18 mg/ml, which is option D.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
