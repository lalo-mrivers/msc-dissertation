["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking where the enzymes of glycolysis are located. We can find this information by looking at the documents provided. The document 'Cellular differentiation and the microcompartmentation of glycolysis' mentions that the glycolytic sequence is micro-organized, which suggests that it occurs in a specific location within the cell. This location is likely to be the cytoplasm, as the enzymes are described as being located in subcellular structures.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
