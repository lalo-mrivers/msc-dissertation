["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The problem is about the velocity of water exiting a fire hose nozzle. Given that pressure is kept constant, we can focus on the effect of decreasing the area of the nozzle. From Bernoulli's principle, as the area decreases, the velocity of the flow increases. So, we need to find the new velocity by using the ratio of areas and the starting velocity. The problem states that the end of the nozzle is 1/3 the area of the start of the hose, so the ratio of areas is 2:1. The final velocity can be calculated using the equation v2/v1 = (A1/A2), where v1 is the initial velocity and A1 is the initial area.\n\nGiven that the starting velocity is 2 m/s, we can set up the equation:\n\n(vf/2)^2 = (2/3)\nwhere vf is the final velocity. Simplifying this equation, we get:\n\nvf^2 = 4\nvf = √4 = 2√1 = 2\n\nSince the velocity cannot be negative, we take the positive square root. This means that the final velocity of water as it exits is equal to the starting velocity.\n\nNow, we can compare this result with the given choices and select the correct answer.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
