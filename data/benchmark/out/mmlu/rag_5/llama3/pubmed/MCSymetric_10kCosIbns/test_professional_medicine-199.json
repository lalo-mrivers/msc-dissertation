["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's tremor has been present for most of her life and initially was mild. However, it has worsened over the past month, suggesting a recent change rather than a chronic condition like Parkinson's disease or essential tremor. The patient is also taking fluoxetine, which could be contributing to the worsening tremor. Furthermore, she is drinking more alcohol daily due to its perceived benefit in reducing her tremor.
