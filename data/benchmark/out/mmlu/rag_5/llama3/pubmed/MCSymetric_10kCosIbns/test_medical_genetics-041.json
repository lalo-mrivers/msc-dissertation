["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the expected incidence of affected homozygous females given that an X-linked recessive disorder is in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Since it's an X-linked recessive disorder, the gene is located on the X chromosome and the disease will only affect males who are hemizygous for the disease-causing allele. The frequency of the disease-causing allele among males is given as 1 in 100. To estimate the expected incidence of affected homozygous females, we can use the formula from [Estimation of the frequency of recessive X-chromosome-associated traits among females]. Since the frequency of the affection among men is known (1 in 100), we can calculate the estimated proportion of female carriers using this formula. This will give us the expected incidence of affected homozygous females.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: 1 in 40 000\""]
