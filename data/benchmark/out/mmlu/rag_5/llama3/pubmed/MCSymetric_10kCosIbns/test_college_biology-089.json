["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the theory of starch granules release from rye grass pollen exposure to water. The document 'Fungal and actinomycete spore aerosols measured at different humidities with an aerodynamic particle sizer' describes how spores change their aerodynamic diameter when passed through air with different humidity. This suggests that osmotic shock could occur when pollen grains are exposed to water, causing the release of starch granules. The document 'Childhood asthma and grass pollen aerobiology in Melbourne' mentions that highest diurnal pollen concentrations occur at night and are associated with winds from certain directions. This implies that meteorological factors like wind direction could contribute to the release of starch granules. Therefore, it is likely that the theory is true.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
