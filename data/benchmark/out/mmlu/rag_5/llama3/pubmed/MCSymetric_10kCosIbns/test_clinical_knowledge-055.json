["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The given information is that the person weighs 62 kg and their drug dose is 15 mg/kg. To find out how many grams is their dose, we need to multiply the weight by the dose factor. The weight is in kilograms, so it needs to be converted to milligrams by multiplying by 1000 (since there are 1000 milligrams per gram). This gives us 62,000 mg.
