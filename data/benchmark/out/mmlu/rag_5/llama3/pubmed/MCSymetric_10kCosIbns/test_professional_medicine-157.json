["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about a study to assess the effectiveness of a new drug for type 2 diabetes mellitus. The population size changes from 1000 to 500 patients. We are asked what would increase if this study were performed in the smaller population. To answer this, we need to consider how the population size affects the power and probability values. A type II error occurs when a true effect exists but is not detected due to low power. With a smaller population (500), the study has lower power, which means there's a higher chance of missing the true effect. Therefore, increasing would be B: Chance of a type II error.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
