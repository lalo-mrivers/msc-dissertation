["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about caloric intake restriction methods for a wrestler trying to lose weight. We need to analyze the provided documents to find relevant information. The first document mentions 'Food and water restriction' as a practice, but it does not provide specific guidelines on how to restrict caloric intake. The second document discusses anthropometric measurements and prediction equations for ideal minimum wrestling weights, which is not related to caloric intake restriction. The third document presents the results of an experiment on caloric deficit and dietary manipulation on aerobic and anaerobic exercise performance. It suggests that a high-carbohydrate diet may be beneficial during caloric restriction. The fourth document investigates metabolic and anthropometric changes with weight cycling in wrestlers, which is not directly related to the question.\n\nConsidering these documents, we need to focus on finding methods to restrict caloric intake that are effective and safe for the wrestler. None of the provided options (A, B, C, D) seem related to caloric intake restriction. The correct answer should be a method that controls food intake or energy expenditure.\", \n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
