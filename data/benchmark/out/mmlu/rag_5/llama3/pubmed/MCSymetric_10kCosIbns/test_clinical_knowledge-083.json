["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, we need to convert the prescribed rate from micrograms to milligrams per kilogram (mg/kg). Since there are 1,000,000 micrograms in a million milligrams, we can divide the prescribed rate by 1,000. This gives us 4/1,000 = 0.004 mg/kg/min. For a 65 kg person, we need to multiply this value by their weight: 0.004 mg/kg/min * 65 kg = 0.26 mg/min. Finally, to find the total amount of dopamine administered in an hour, we can multiply this value by 60 minutes.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
