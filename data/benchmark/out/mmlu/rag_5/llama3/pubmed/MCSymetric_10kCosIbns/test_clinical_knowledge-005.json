["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the changes that occur with an increasing number of sprints. The relevant documents provided are related to running performance, biomechanics, and exercise physiology. After analyzing the documents, I found that sprinting is characterized by anaerobic energy expenditure, particularly in the early stages. As the number of sprints increases, the anaerobic contribution may not progressively increase due to factors such as fatigue, lactate accumulation, and altered muscle fiber recruitment patterns.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
