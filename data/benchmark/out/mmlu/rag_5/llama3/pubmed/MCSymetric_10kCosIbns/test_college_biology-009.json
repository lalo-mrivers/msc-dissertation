["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the parent structures of influenza virus in infected cells. In the cytoplasm, functionally active parental structures were found in the area of nucleocapsids (40-50 S). Upon recentrifugation in cesium chloride gradient, some of these structures showed nucleocapsid density of 1.34 g/cm3, and some a higher density (1.40-1.41 g/cm3). In the nucleoplasm, the functionally active structures sedimented in the zones of 20-35 S and 3 hours postinfection in the zone of 70-90 S. Both in the cytoplasm and nucleoplasm the parental structures were unstable, undergoing rapid deproteinization. Similar parental structures were found in permissive and nonpermissive cell systems.\n\nThe intracellular structures of influenza virus involved in RNA synthesis were studied in infected chicken fibroblasts. Functionally active virus-specific structures were found in the nucleoplasm and showed that a functionally active virus-specific structure was localized in the nucleoplasm of infected cells. This structure contained proteins of the viral ribonucleoprotein, but sedimented somewhat faster (at 60--90S in velocity sucrose and glycerol gradients).\n\nDuring the early stage of infection, large virus specific structures were found containing parent nucleocapsids, newly synthesized virus-specific RNA and newly synthesized protein. The buoyant density of these structures in cesium chloride was 1.30--1.32 g/ml.\n\nThe question asks what influenza virus does when it enters a cell. From the above information, we can conclude that the virus starts to replicate its genetic material and synthesize viral proteins.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
