["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has a squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue, which is typically associated with cervical lymph node metastases. The tumor stage is unknown, but it's mentioned that the primary lesion is 'controlled' in 9 out of 11 patients in a similar study. This suggests that the patient may have occult metastases. Given the risk of recurrence and mortality rate, thorough evaluation for metastasis is crucial. The question asks which lymph nodes to evaluate first, so we should consider the most common sites of metastasis from tongue cancer. According to the literature on squamous cell carcinoma of the oral tongue, the incidence of occult metastases in stage II patients is high (36%). Therefore, it's likely that this patient also has occult metastases. The inferior deep cervical lymph nodes are the first site to evaluate for evidence of metastasis.\", \"answer_choice\": A}"]
