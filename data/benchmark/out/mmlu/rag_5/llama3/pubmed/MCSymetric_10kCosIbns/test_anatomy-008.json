["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the fusion of palatine processes. The provided documents describe various anatomical structures related to the palate, but none of them specifically mention the timing of palatine process fusion. However, one document discusses the morphology of M. palatoglossus in a 15-week human fetus. This suggests that the development of the palatal region is ongoing at around 15 weeks post-fertilization. Given this information, it's reasonable to assume that the palatine processes may start fusing around this time.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
