["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the fate of ammonia produced when branched-chain amino acids are deaminated in muscle. The relevant documents are from 1980s research papers on amino acid metabolism and transport. One document discusses branched-chain amino acid transferase (BATase) activity, which is increased by feeding rats branched-chain keto-analogues. Another document compares AMP deaminase from skeletal muscle of acidotic and normal rats, showing no significant difference in specific activity between the two groups. The third document examines amino acid metabolism in liver tissue, where most ramified-chain amino acids are metabolized rather than retained. Finally, a fourth document discusses competition for transport of amino acids into rat heart. Since there is no direct information on ammonia fate in muscle, we must consider the overall context of amino acid metabolism and deamination.\\r\\n\", \"answer_choice\": C}"]
