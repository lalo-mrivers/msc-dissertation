["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about a 13-month-old child with urticaria, swelling of the lips, and difficulty breathing immediately after eating an egg. This suggests an allergic reaction to a food allergen, specifically eggs. Since vaccinations against diphtheria, tetanus and whooping cough are not mentioned in the provided documents, I will look for any contraindications related to vaccines that could be relevant to this case. None of the provided documents mention hypersensitivity reactions or allergies as contraindications for vaccines. Therefore, I will look for any vaccine-related information that could potentially lead to an allergic reaction. The document [Findings concerning characteristics of responses to administration of vaccines containing antigenic complexes of enteric bacteria and tetanus toxoid] mentions some changes in the blood test results and ECG changes after vaccination, but no mention of hypersensitivity reactions or allergies.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
