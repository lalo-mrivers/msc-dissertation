["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"There is no direct connection between the subclavian arteries and the brain areas. We need to look for anatomical observations that link the subclavian arteries to the vertebral artery and then to the brain. From the provided documents, we can see that in case of proximal subclavian occlusion, a direct carotid-vertebral anastomosis supplies blood collaterally in the subclavian occlusion. This suggests that the vertebral artery is connected to the carotid artery and ultimately supplies the brain areas.\", \"answer_choice\": B}"]
