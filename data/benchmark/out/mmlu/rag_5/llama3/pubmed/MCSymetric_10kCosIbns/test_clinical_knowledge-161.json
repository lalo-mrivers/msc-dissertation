["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the net production of ATP via substrate-level phosphorylation in glycolysis. Substrate-level phosphorylation occurs at three steps: glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), phosphoglycerate kinase, and pyruvate kinase. The relevant documents describe glycolysis in human erythrocytes, including the formation of lactate, ATP-synthesis, and -consumption. Based on these documents, we can infer that substrate-level phosphorylation occurs during the glycolytic pathway, specifically at the GAPDH, phosphoglycerate kinase, and pyruvate kinase steps. The net production of ATP is a sum of the ATP produced at each step.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
