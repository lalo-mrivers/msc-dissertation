["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to the provided documents, we know that during DNA replication, mistakes are coded into the leading strand about once every 100,000/1 million copies. This DNA is subject to proofreading by several mechanisms. The key point here is that the mistake is noted and the incorrect base is removed shortly following the time RNA primer is removed. This suggests that the error is detected and corrected before the DNA synthesis continues. Based on this information, we can infer that the repair mechanism responsible for removing the incorrect base is the proofreading 3' leads to 5' exonuclease mentioned in the first document.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C: Mismatch repair mechanism\"\n}"]
