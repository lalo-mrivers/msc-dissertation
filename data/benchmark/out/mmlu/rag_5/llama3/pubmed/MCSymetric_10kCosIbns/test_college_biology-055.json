["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The problem involves manipulating an amphibian zygote's first cleavage plane so that one of the resulting blastomeres contains the gray crescent. This manipulation will likely affect the cell's developmental potential and viability. Given the data from [Invariance of asymmetric cleavage during structural changes in Pulmonata zygotes], which shows that the direction of rotation during the first cleavage division does not depend on zygote size, cytoplasm and cortex composition, or the direction of cleavage furrow with respect to the axis of stratification of the zygote content. This suggests that the gray crescent might be influencing the developmental potential of the blastomeres. As a result, I expect the blastomere containing the gray crescent to have a higher developmental potential.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
