["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The β-oxidation of a molecule of palmitic acid is the process by which it is broken down into smaller units. Each cycle of β-oxidation produces one molecule of acetyl-CoA and one molecule of NADH or FADH2, depending on the substrate. The number of cycles required to break down palmitic acid depends on its length. Palmitic acid has 16 carbon atoms, so it would require 7 cycles of β-oxidation to produce 8 molecules of acetyl-CoA.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
