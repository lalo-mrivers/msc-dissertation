["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the risk of miscarriage associated with amniocentesis. Looking at the relevant documents, we can see that there is a mention of spontaneous abortions in some studies. In 'Pregnancy outcome after early amniocentesis', it is mentioned that the spontaneous abortion rate following amniocentesis was 2.8%.
