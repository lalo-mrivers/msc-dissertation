["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The provided documents highlight the importance of nipple discharge as a symptom in breast disease. The patient's age (52) suggests that she is at an increased risk for breast cancer. However, the discharge is greenish, which is not typically associated with breast cancer. Fibrocystic disease and mammary duct ectasia are also possibilities, but they do not usually cause greenish discharge. A pituitary adenoma could potentially cause nipple discharge, but it is unlikely to be greenish in color.
