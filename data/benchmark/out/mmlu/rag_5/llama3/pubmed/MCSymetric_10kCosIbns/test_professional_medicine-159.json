["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the relative risk of death from a specific type of cancer in individuals who take Drug X compared to those who don't. To answer this, we need to look at the number of individuals who died of that type of cancer in each group and calculate the ratio.\n\nFrom the given data, 100 individuals who received Drug X (200 total) died of the specific type of cancer, which is a rate of 50%. Similarly, 100 individuals from the non-Drug X group (400 total) also died of the same type of cancer, which is a rate of 25%.\n\nThe relative risk can be calculated by dividing the number of deaths in the Drug X group by the number of deaths in the non-Drug X group. This gives us a ratio of 1:1, or equal risk.\",\n\"answer_choice\": A"]
