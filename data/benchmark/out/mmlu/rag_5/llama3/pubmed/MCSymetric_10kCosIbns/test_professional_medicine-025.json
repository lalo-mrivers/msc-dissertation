["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 17-year-old girl with a 2-month history of exercise-induced cough and nasal congestion. She has no underlying medical conditions and does not smoke. The cough is nonproductive and resolves with rest. Her sister has asthma, which suggests a potential genetic link to the condition.\n\nSpirometry shows an FEV1:FVC ratio of 90% and an FEV1 of 90% of predicted, which indicates that her lung function is normal.\n\nThe patient's symptoms are consistent with cough-type asthma, as described in the first document. Exercise-induced cough and nasal congestion are common features of this condition.\n\nIn addition, the fact that her sister has asthma suggests a possible genetic predisposition to developing asthma.\n\nBased on these findings, it is likely that the patient has cough-type asthma.\", \"answer_choice\": A}"]
