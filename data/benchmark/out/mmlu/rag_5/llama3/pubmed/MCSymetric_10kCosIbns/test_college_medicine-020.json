["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe steroids as a class of molecules with specific structures. The molecular structure and drug activity document highlights the importance of small changes in structure leading to different biological properties. The mutagenic activity of oxathiolane steroids document describes the structural requirements for genotoxic activity, including an electron-donating group at position 3 and a bulky group anchored at the 5th and 6th positions. The steroid structure and steroid activity document reviews the diverse biological effects associated with naturally occurring steroids and discusses the impact of chemical structure changes on biological activity. The Effect of steroid hormones on the rate of NADPH and NADH oxidation by rat liver microsomes document describes the relationship between oxidation rates and polarity of steroid molecules.\n\nBased on this information, we can identify the following steroid-based molecules: Testosterone (I), Progesterone (III), and R 2858, R 2453, R 2323, R 1697, and R 2010 (mentioned in the Radioimmunoassay of synthetic steroids document as examples of synthetic steroids).\n\nTriglycerides (II) are not steroid-based molecules, but rather a type of lipid.\n\nDNA (IV) is also not a steroid-based molecule, but rather a type of nucleic acid.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer choice is: C: I and III\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
