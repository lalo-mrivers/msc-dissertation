["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents discuss the structure and function of skeletal muscle. The key components mentioned are actin, myosin, tropomyosin, troponin, and calcium ions. Calcium ions play a crucial role in controlling contraction by interacting with tropomyosin and troponin. The mechanism of contraction is described as a sliding filament mechanism produced by cross-bridges between thick and thin filaments. Considering this information, the two principal contractile proteins found in skeletal muscle are likely to be actin and myosin.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
