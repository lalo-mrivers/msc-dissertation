["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the result of a point mutation and deletion on the original DNA sequence, we need to analyze the possible changes that can occur. The original DNA sequence is 5’ – GGATCCTCATG – 3’. A point mutation can be an insertion, deletion, or substitution of one nucleotide. A deletion can be at any position in the sequence. Let's consider each possibility:\n\n* Point mutation: If we substitute a different base for one of the original bases, it could result in options B or C.\n* Deletion: If we delete one or more nucleotides from the original sequence, it could result in option D.\n\nConsidering both possibilities, the most likely outcome is that the point mutation and deletion occurred at the same position. Therefore, the correct answer should be a combination of these two events.\n\nAnalyzing the options, we see that only option D meets this criteria – it has a deletion and a point mutation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
