["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents discuss the effects of nerve activity on the postsynaptic membrane of skeletal muscle, transmission of excitation from muscle to nerve, and ephaptic influence of the electrical activity of muscle on the contiguous nerve. It is mentioned that after 1 h of nerve stimulation, muscles become more sensitive to suxamethonium, a blocking agent. The increased sensitivity is also observed in muscles from rats which had been curarized during the period of stimulation. This suggests that the motor nerve increases the sensitivity of the end plates to transmitter.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
