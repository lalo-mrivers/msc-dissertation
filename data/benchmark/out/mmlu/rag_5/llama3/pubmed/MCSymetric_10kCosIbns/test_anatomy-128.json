["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant document that talks about saliva is 'More Salvia agglutinins'. According to this section, six further examples of haemagglutinins from Salvia are reported; one is anti-T and 5 are anti-Tn.

Given that this section does not specifically discuss saliva, we can infer that the enzyme acting upon starches is also present in saliva.\", \"answer_choice\": A}"]
