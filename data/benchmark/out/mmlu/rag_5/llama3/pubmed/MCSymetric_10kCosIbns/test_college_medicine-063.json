["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking which phases are common to cells undergoing meiosis and mitosis. Meiosis and mitosis both involve cell division, but they differ in the number of DNA replications that occur during each phase. Mitosis involves one round of DNA replication, whereas meiosis involves two rounds of DNA replication followed by two successive divisions. The question is asking which phases are common to both processes.\n\nThe answer can be found by looking at the relevant documents provided. In the document 'Biochemistry of meiosis', it is mentioned that the process of meiosis in Lilium falls into four physiological stages - prezygotene, zygotene, pachytene, and post-pachytene. Each of these stages has distinctive metabolic characteristics.\n\nIn the document 'Cell cycle in heteronuclear cell line VUP-1', it is mentioned that metaphase was the longest stage in VUP-1 line cells (about 3-4 hours). This suggests that metaphase is a common phase to both meiosis and mitosis, as it is a critical stage in both processes.\n\nThe document 'Detection by means of cell fusion' also mentions that about 20% of early G1 cells, 35% of cells at the G1/S boundary, 50% of S cells, and 70% of late S/G2 cells could induce nuclear envelope formation during subsequent fusion. This suggests that the phase S is common to both meiosis and mitosis, as it is a critical stage in both processes.\n\nTherefore, based on the relevant documents provided, the correct answer would be C: II and III only.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
