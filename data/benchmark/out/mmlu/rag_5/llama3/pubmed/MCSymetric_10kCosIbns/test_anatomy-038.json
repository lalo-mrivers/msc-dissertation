["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the composition of the walls of bronchioles. From the documents provided, it can be seen that the normal ultrastructure of small bronchi and bronchioli in man describes the presence of a ciliated cylindrical epithelium, reticulin layer, glands in the submucosa, and a rich submucosal vascular network. The histological changes of terminal bronchioles in rats during exposure to nitrogen dioxide describe the development of non-ciliated epithelium without determinable Clara cells. Thickness and composition of non-respiratory bronchiolar walls in normal and emphysematous lungs were quantitatively assessed, showing a gradual increase in thickness with increasing caliber but not proportionate. Finally, resistance of hamster bronchiolar epithelium to neutrophil elastase was investigated by cell surface lectin cytochemistry, which showed that the principal granulated secretory cell type in bronchioles is similar to a form of bronchial Clara cell that converts to a mucous cell phenotype.\n\nGiven these descriptions, it can be concluded that the walls of bronchioles contain respiratory epithelium.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
