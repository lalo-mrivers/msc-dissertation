["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The article explains that sauna use elicits mild hyperthermia, which induces a thermoregulatory response involving neuroendocrine, cardiovascular, and cytoprotective mechanisms. The body's core temperature increases rapidly to 39°C (102.2°F). To mitigate this increase in core body temperature, the body's plasma volume increases transiently. This increase in plasma volume not only provides a reserve source of fluid for sweating but also acts like the water in a car's radiator, cooling the body and promoting heat tolerance. Therefore, it is important to replenish fluids after sauna use.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
