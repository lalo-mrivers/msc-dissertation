["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to the provided documents, we know that each chromosome carries a specific gene locus. The documents state that about 210 gene loci are known, with at least one assigned to each chromosome (including the Y), about 110 assigned to specific autosomes, and about 100 to the X chromosome.
