["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the structures that act as sites of gas exchange in a woody stem. The relevant documents provided are related to tree bole and branch form, enzymic activities during differentiation of cambium to xylem, changes in tetrahydrofolate enzyme levels in Acetobacterium woodii, and seasonal changes in the concentration of major storage protein and its mRNA in xylem ray cells of poplar trees. None of these documents directly mention gas exchange or woody stem structures. Therefore, we must consider the overall concept of gas exchange in plants. In woody stems, gas exchange occurs through lenticels, which are specialized structures that allow for gas exchange between the internal tissues of the plant and the external environment.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
