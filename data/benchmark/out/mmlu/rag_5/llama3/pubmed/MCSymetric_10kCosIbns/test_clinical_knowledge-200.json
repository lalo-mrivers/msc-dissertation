["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The rate of blood lactate accumulation is determined by an increase in lactate concentration which can be caused either by an increased production (primarily by the so-called peripheral tissues) or by a decreased utilization. The metabolism of lactate and pyruvate are described, showing that anaerobic synthesis of lactate is an emergency reaction to supply minimum energy to tissues with insufficient oxygen supply. This suggests that the rate of blood lactate accumulation is determined by the rate of muscle lactate production and the rate of muscle lactate efflux, as peripheral tissues produce lactate under conditions of low oxygen availability.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
