["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has a history of passing a renal calculus with calcium as the primary cation. The 24-hour collection of urine shows increased calcium excretion. This suggests that the patient may have hypercalcaemia due to excessive urinary calcium excretion. Considering the documents provided, it is likely that the patient has hypercalcaemia caused by treatment with calcium-containing drugs or other factors that increase urinary calcium excretion.\n\nThe patient's physical examination shows no abnormalities, which rules out florid hyperparathyroidism as a cause of hypercalcaemia.\n\nGiven these findings, the most appropriate pharmacotherapy would be to reduce the frequency of hypercalcemia. The documents suggest that oral calcium acetate and calcium carbonate can control predialytic hyperphosphatemia, but may not decrease the frequency of hypercalcemia.\n\nBased on this information, we should focus on reducing the frequency of hypercalcemia rather than increasing or decreasing its excretion. Therefore, option D: Osmotic diuretic is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
