["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about where parasympathetic preganglionic axons leave the CNS. The relevant documents mention the superior cervical ganglion, which is innervated by sympathetic postganglionic fibers, but not specifically mentioned as being related to parasympathetic preganglionic axons. However, one of the documents mentions that SPNs (sympathetic preganglionic neurons) were labeled with CTb which was injected into the superior cervical ganglion. This suggests that the superior cervical ganglion may be involved in the regulation of sympathetic preganglionic fibers, but it does not directly address the question about where parasympathetic preganglionic axons leave the CNS.\n\nThe other documents do not provide direct information on this topic. However, one document mentions that preganglionic axons arising from different levels of the thoracic spinal cord cause different effects on end-organs supplied by the superior cervical ganglion. This suggests that parasympathetic preganglionic fibers may arise from the thoracic spinal cord.\n\nBased on this information, it is likely that parasympathetic preganglionic axons leave the CNS with the thoracic spinal nerves.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
