["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the key attribute for successful marathon running. Based on the provided documents, we can see that the studies focus on physiological, biochemical, and psychological aspects of marathon runners. The document 'Oxygen uptake measurements during competitive marathon running' shows that the energy expenditure of the runners was 68-100% of their VO2 max, which suggests that stamina is an important factor. Similarly, the document 'The energy cost of an 80 km run' states that the high energy costs reported for the marathon cannot be sustained over a long distance but that about 60% of VO2 max can be continued for seven hours and longer. This also implies that stamina is a crucial attribute. The other options (strength, power) do not seem to be directly related to successful marathon running.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: stamina\""]
