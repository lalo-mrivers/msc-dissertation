["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks which disorder is not suitable for population carrier screening. We can look at the provided documents to find information on carrier screening. Part II of the first document discusses screening criteria and mentions that characteristics of the disease, characteristics of the test, and characteristics of the population to be screened need to be fulfilled. In the context of genetic screening, we can look at the document 'Genetic screening: triumphs, problems, and controversies' for more information.\n\nIn this document, we find examples of successful genetic screening programs, including newborn screening for phenylketonuria and carrier detection for Tay-Sachs disease. We also learn about mass screening for heterozygosity for cystic fibrosis, which has engendered controversy.\n\nWe can deduce that cystic fibrosis is a suitable candidate for population carrier screening based on the example provided in the document.\n\nThe other options, Oculocutaneous albinism and Sickle cell disease, are not specifically mentioned as being subject to population carrier screening. However, we do learn about Tay-Sachs disease being an example of successful carrier detection.\n\nTherefore, considering all the information, we can conclude that B: Oculocutaneous albinism is the disorder that is not suitable for population carrier screening.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
