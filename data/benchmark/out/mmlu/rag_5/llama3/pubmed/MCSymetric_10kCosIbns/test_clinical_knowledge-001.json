["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the key attribute in successful marathon running. We can look at the provided documents for clues. The first document talks about physiological results obtained by various investigators on participants in competitive marathons, but it doesn't specifically mention stamina as a key attribute. The second and third documents talk about energy expenditure and VO2 max, which are related to endurance rather than strength or power. The fourth document discusses the effects of marathon running on blood coagulation and fibrinolysis, but it doesn't directly address the question either. However, we can infer that stamina is important from the fact that one runner in the second document was found to be utilizing 4.54 l/min at 23.4 miles, a value equivalent to his VO2 max, indicating that endurance is crucial for marathon running.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
