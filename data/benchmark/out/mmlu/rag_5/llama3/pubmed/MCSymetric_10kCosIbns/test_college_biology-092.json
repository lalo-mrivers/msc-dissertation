["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the Hardy-Weinberg law and its application to population genetics. However, they do not explicitly mention genetic drift as a requirement for Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Genetic drift is a process that can affect allele frequencies in small populations, but it is not inherently incompatible with Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. The other options (a large population, random mating, and absence of selection) are all mentioned as assumptions or conditions necessary for the Hardy-Weinberg law to hold.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
