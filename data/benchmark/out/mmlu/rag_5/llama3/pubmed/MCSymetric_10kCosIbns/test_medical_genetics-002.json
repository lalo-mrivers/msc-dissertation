["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to the document '[Estimation of the frequency of recessive X-chromosome-associated traits among females]', we can estimate the expected proportion of female carriers using the formula. Since the frequency of affected males is 0.10, and there is no fertility bias (f=1), the expected proportion of female carriers can be calculated as follows: Let p = frequency of affected males, then q = 1-p = 0.9. The probability that a male has an affected daughter is pq. Since we know p = 0.10, we can calculate q as 0.9. The probability that a male has an affected daughter is pq = 0.10*0.9 = 0.09. This means the expected frequency of affected females is the square of this value: (pq)^2 = (0.09)^2 = 0.0081, which can be rounded to 0.01.\",\n\"answer_choice\": A"]
