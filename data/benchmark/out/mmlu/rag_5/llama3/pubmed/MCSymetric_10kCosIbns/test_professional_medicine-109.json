["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question describes a patient with recurrent blisters on the flexural areas. The lesions are widespread but not oral. This suggests that the blisters may be caused by friction or mechanical trauma rather than an underlying disease. The passage about oral non-dystrophic bullous eruption mainly limited to the gingivae suggests a mechano-bullous response, which is consistent with this patient's symptoms. Therefore, the answer lies in understanding the causes of blister formation due to mechanical trauma.\n\nThe passage 'Friction blisters as a manifestation of pathomimia' discusses the production of vesicles or bullae by friction. This suggests that the blisters may be caused by adhesion failure involving the dermal-epidermal junction, which is disrupted by friction.\n\nThe passage 'A double-blind comparison of adhesive bandages with the use of uniform suction blister wounds' discusses the use of suction blisters as a model for evaluating wound healing. This suggests that suction blisters can be used to study the effects of mechanical trauma on the skin.\n\nThe passage '[Compression technic of the upper limbs with adhesive bands to reduce edema]' does not provide relevant information for answering this question.\n\nTherefore, based on the symptoms and the passages discussed above, it is likely that the adhesion failure involves the dermal-epidermal junction, which is disrupted by friction.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
