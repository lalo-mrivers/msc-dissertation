["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about involuntary movements in the arm. From the given documents, I can infer that there are studies on reflexes during intentional forearm flexion, antagonist muscle activity during rapid arm movements, and motor control of voluntary arm movements. These studies suggest that proprioceptive influences play a role in muscle contraction, including antagonist muscles. This is also supported by the study on perception of impossible limb positions induced by tendon vibration, which implies that position sense can be operating on the basis of extrapolation.\n\nHowever, I don't see any direct information about involuntary movements in the arm, such as tremors or dystonias. The closest related concept is from the study on motor control of voluntary arm movements, which mentions different types of movement programs and their sensitivity to target size.\n\nBased on this analysis, I conclude that there isn't enough information in these documents to make a direct connection between involuntary movements and the given options.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
