["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents discuss muscle structure and function, with a focus on the mechanism of muscular contraction and its control. According to the provided information, calcium plays a crucial role in controlling muscle contraction. When the calcium concentration is low, tropomyosin and troponin interfere with the formation of cross-bridges and prevent contraction. However, when the calcium concentration is increased, these proteins no longer interfere and contraction proceeds.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
