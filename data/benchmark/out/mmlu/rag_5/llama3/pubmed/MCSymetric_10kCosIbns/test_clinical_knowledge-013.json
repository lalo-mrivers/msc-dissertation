["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the initial result of glycogen breakdown in muscle. In the first document, it is mentioned that during exercise, glycogen decrements have been observed in non-exercising muscles. Additionally, an increase in tissue lactate concentrations occurred in both non-exercising and exercising muscle. This suggests that glycogen breakdown leads to the formation of glycolytic intermediates, including lactate. In the second document, it is mentioned that phosphorylase activity was measured in biopsy samples and single muscle fibers. The conditions of assay used were pH 6.8 and 35 degrees C. Mean phosphorylase activity per kg fresh muscle in 8 male volunteers was: phosphorylase a - 259 U, and total phosphorylase - 627 U. This suggests that glycogen breakdown leads to the formation of glucose-1-phosphate.\n\nLooking at the relevant documents, it can be seen that glycogen breakdown leads to the formation of glycolytic intermediates, including lactate, and ultimately glucose-6-phosphate. The first step in glycogen breakdown is phosphorylation by glycogen phosphorylase to form glucose-1-phosphate, which then gets converted to glucose-6-phosphate.\n\nBased on this information, it can be concluded that glycogen breakdown initially results in the formation of glucose-6-phosphate.\", \"answer_choice\": C}"]
