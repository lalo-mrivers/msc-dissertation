["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about which factor would increase the rate of gas diffusion between alveoli and blood within a pulmonary capillary. We need to consider factors that could influence this process. From the documents, we can see that diffusion plays a significant role in intrapulmonary gas transport, especially when relative diffusivity is extremely large. The document on 'Mixing in flowing gas' highlights the importance of radial diffusion during convective bulk flow. Based on these findings, increasing the total surface area available for diffusion (choice C) seems like a logical solution to increase the rate of gas diffusion.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
