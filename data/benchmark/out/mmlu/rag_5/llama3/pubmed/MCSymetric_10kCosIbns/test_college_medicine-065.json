["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the ratio of purines to pyrimidines in a double-stranded DNA molecule. The relevant documents mention different types of DNA structures and sequences, but they don't provide information on the purine-to-pyrimidine ratio. However, it's stated that B-form is the most energetically favorable structure, and that the stability of DNA duplexes depends on base sequence. This suggests that the ratio might be dependent on the specific sequence of the DNA molecule. Therefore, it's reasonable to conclude that the answer is not always 1:1.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
