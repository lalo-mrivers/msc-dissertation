["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the alternation of generations in ferns. From the provided documents, there is no direct information about the dominance of sporophyte or gametophyte. However, we can look at the general structure of ferns' life cycle. According to the documents, ferns have a highly rearranged chloroplast genome, and the evolutionary genetics of sexual systems in flowering plants suggests that populations with intermediate levels of self-fertilization are the most likely starting state for the evolution of outbreeding mechanisms. This implies that ferns may have a more complex life cycle than simple alternation of generations. Therefore, we can eliminate choices C and D as they suggest a simpler life cycle. The remaining options A and B require us to consider the structure of gametophyte and sporophyte in ferns.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
