["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to the Human Genome Project, there are 100,000 genes in the human genome. Since DNA replication guarantees exact gene copies and chromosome meiosis and crossing over guarantees varied gene combinations, it can be inferred that these genes provide the blueprint for the amino acid sequence of structural protein or functional protein. The database constructed focuses on the normal functions of the currently-known protein products of the Human Genome. Therefore, it can be concluded that approximately what fraction of the human genome encodes proteins is a significant proportion.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C: 50%\""]
