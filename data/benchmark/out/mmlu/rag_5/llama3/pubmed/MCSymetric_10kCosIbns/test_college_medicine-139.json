["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the way lactate and hydrogen ions leave the muscle. From the given documents, we can see that lactate content was highly elevated in muscle after exercise and decreased exponentially with respect to time during recovery. This suggests that there is an active process involved in removing lactate from the muscle.\n\nRegarding hydrogen ions, the document 'Comparison of efflux rates of hydrogen and lactate ions from isolated muscles in vitro' shows that the rate of efflux of hydrogen ions exceeded that of lactate ions by factors of about 14 and 50. This difference in efflux kinetics suggests that there may be a specific mechanism for removing hydrogen ions from the muscle.\n\nConsidering these points, we can infer that both lactate and hydrogen ions likely leave the muscle via an active transport mechanism, which involves energy expenditure to drive their movement against concentration gradients.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
