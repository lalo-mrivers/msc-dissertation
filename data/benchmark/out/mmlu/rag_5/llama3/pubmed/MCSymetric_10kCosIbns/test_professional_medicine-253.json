["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 75-year-old female who presents with fatigue but still maintains her daily activities. The laboratory results show a leukocyte count of 25.0 Ã— 103/mcL, which is higher than the normal range. The peripheral blood smear shows 97% mature-appearing lymphocytes. Immunohistochemical stains demonstrate that the lymphocytes are of B-cell origin. Considering these findings, it is likely that the patient has an expansion of B cells in her circulation, which could be due to a chronic autoimmune disorder or a neoplastic process such as chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). The fact that the patient's fatigue may be related to the high leukocyte count and the mature-appearing lymphocytes on the peripheral blood smear suggests that CLL is a possible diagnosis.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
