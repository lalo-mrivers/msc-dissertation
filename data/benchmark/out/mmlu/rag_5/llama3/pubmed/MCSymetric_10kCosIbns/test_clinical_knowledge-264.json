["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking why a patient's self-report of pain is important. The relevant documents suggest that expression of pain is influenced by physical, psychological, and cultural background, so it is crucial to assess individual needs rather than making value judgments. In the study 'Nurses' assessment of pain in hospitalised patients', it was found that patients' and nurses' ratings of pain intensity were poorly correlated.
