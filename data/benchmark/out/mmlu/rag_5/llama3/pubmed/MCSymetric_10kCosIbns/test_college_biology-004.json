["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the provided documents, it is clear that RNA-synthesis can occur without a DNA-primer. This is evident from the [In vitro RNA-synthesis on immobilized DNA-templates] document, where it was shown that E. coli RNA-polymerase can synthesize RNA molecules of approximately 30 nucleotides in length using denatured DNA-templates from mouse liver, immobilized on nitrocellulose filters. Additionally, the [Transcription of synthetic oligonucleotides] document shows that transcription by E. coli RNA-polymerase can occur without a primer, as demonstrated by the synthesis of RNA molecules longer than the template. Furthermore, the [Isolation of a hybrid between rat ribosomal RNA and DNA] document describes the isolation and purification of an rRNA-DNA hybrid complex, which suggests that RNA-DNA hybrids can be formed without the need for primers or reverse transcriptase. Therefore, it is possible to synthesize an RNA/DNA hybrid from a single-stranded RNA template using E. coli RNA-polymerase alone.\", \"answer_choice\": B}"]
