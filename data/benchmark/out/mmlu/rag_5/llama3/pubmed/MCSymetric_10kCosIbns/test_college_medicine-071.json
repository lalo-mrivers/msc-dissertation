["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking when maximal dynamic exercise becomes predominantly aerobic. The documents provided discuss different aspects of exercise such as the nature of training responses, role of aerobic metabolism, assessment of static component, cardiorespiratory and metabolic responses to positive, negative and minimum-load dynamic leg exercise, and distinctive effects of three different modes of exercise on oxygen uptake, heart rate and blood lactate and pyruvate. The key information is that maximal oxygen uptake (VO2) and endurance are important factors in prolonged intensive exercise. VO2 max usually recorded on normal subjects and those specially trained for endurance events is given. Training permits the muscles to store large quantities of glycogen and enables the organism to increase the percentage of energetic substrates made up by lipids., \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
