["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the stabilization of an alpha helix. The relevant documents discuss different types of interactions that stabilize the structure of peptides and proteins, including hydrogen bonding between peptide backbone atoms, ion pairs, and electrostatic interactions. In 'Side chain-backbone hydrogen bonding contributes to helix stability in peptides derived from an alpha-helical region of carboxypeptidase A', it is mentioned that side-chain-backbone hydrogen bonding contributes to helix stability. This suggests that the stabilization of the alpha helix is not solely due to hydrogen bonding between peptide backbone atoms, but rather a combination of different interactions. In 'An incipient 3(10) helix in Piv-Pro-Pro-Ala-NHMe as a model for peptide folding', it is mentioned that the transformation from a 3(10) helical structure to an alpha-helix should be facile and requires only small changes in the phi and psi conformational angles and a rearrangement of the hydrogen bonding pattern. This suggests that the stabilization of the alpha helix is not solely due to hydrogen bonding between peptide backbone atoms, but rather involves a combination of different interactions.\", \"answer_choice\": A}"]
