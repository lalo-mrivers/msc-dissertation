["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about a 7-month-old infant with persistent watery diarrhea. The patient has recently been discharged from the hospital following an episode of enteritis and dehydration. He is fed cow-milk formula and strained fruits and vegetables. Upon physical examination, his temperature is normal, his mucous membranes are dry, and his abdomen is slightly distended. Based on these findings, I will consider the possible causes of diarrhea in children mentioned in the relevant documents. Food intolerance could be a possibility. Fructose intolerance is an enzyme deficiency that can cause osmotic diarrhea. Transient lactase deficiency is also an option as the patient is fed cow-milk formula. Magnesium deficiency might not be directly related to the symptoms, but it's included in the options for completeness. Regional enteritis is unlikely given the absence of any other significant abnormalities on physical examination.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
