["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents provide information about the anatomy of the soft palate, including its tissue layers and muscle composition. The histologic study of the normal human adult soft palate mentions that the two middle layers are muscular with the more inferior layer consisting mainly of transverse levator veli palatini fibers and the overlying longitudinal layer of musculus uvulae fibers. This information suggests that the muscles of the soft palate are related to the levator veli palatini and musculus uvulae muscles. The anatomical confirmation for our surgical technique is provided by a publication by Kriens, which confirms that intermingling vertical and horizontal muscle fibres within the soft palate.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
