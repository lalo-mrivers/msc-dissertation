["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe various aspects of DNA structure and stability. Thermodynamics of DNA duplexes with adjacent G.A mismatches suggests that the sequence 5'-pyrimidine-GA-purine-3' forms a stable conformational unit that fits well into a B-form double helix. Alternating d(G-A) sequences form a parallel-stranded DNA homoduplex, which is stable at pH 4-9. The study of the relationship between secondary DNA structure and base sequence by theoretical conformational analysis reveals that B-form is the most energetically favorable structure, and its stability depends on the base sequence. Stability of pyrimidine oligodeoxyribonucleotides released during degradation of deoxyribonucleic acid with formic acid-diphenylamine reagent shows that any analysis of pyrimidine tracts in a DNA molecule should make some correction for the small degree of degradation if exact assignments of the numbers of pyrimidine tracts are to be made. Synthesis of oligodeoxyribonucleotides containing degenerate bases and their use as primers in the polymerase chain reaction suggests that the use of the degenerate bases P and K in primer design is established.\n\nConsidering these documents, it can be concluded that the ratio of purines : pyrimidines is variable.\", \"answer_choice\": D}"]
