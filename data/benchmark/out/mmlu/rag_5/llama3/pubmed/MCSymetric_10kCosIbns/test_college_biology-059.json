["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the provided documents, it seems that none of the attributes mentioned are directly related to self-similarity or fractal structure of biological classifications. However, we can analyze the problem by considering factors that might influence a species' distribution. We see from 'Genetic variation in heterogeneous environments' that polymorphism can be maintained if there is a positive correlation between genetic and environmental variation. This suggests that species with high dispersal abilities would have an advantage in colonizing new habitats. Therefore, we should look for biological attributes related to dispersal or colonization.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
