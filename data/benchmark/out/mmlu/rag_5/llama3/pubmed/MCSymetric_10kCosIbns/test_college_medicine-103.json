["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the provided documents, we can see that mutations are errors in DNA that occur due to various mechanisms such as alkylating agents, oxygen free radicals, and normal cellular processes. The biochemistry of mutagenesis reveals two major classes of mutagenic mechanisms: directly induced base mispairing, and misrepair. Additionally, endogenous mutations can result from errors in DNA replication, depurination, and damage to DNA by oxygen free radicals. Therefore, option D 'occur spontaneously at a low rate' is the most accurate description of mutations.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
