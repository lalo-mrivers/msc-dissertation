["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the anatomical region of abdomen that lies just distal to the sternum. The sternalis muscles are located superficial to the medial part of the pectoralis major, arising from the sternum. This implies that the sternalis muscle is situated anteriorly (front) to the sternum. The article [Clinical morphology of the sternum] mentions that the manubrium and corpus of the sternum show relatively minor differences in width and thickness. There are no hints about any anatomical regions being located posteriorly (back) to the sternum. Hence, we can rule out B: Hypochondriac as it is a region located posteriorly. Similarly, C: Hypogastric is not correct as it is an abdominal region located inferiorly (below) to the sternum. The sternalis muscle being situated anteriorly and the lack of any information about regions lying posteriorly or below rule out D: Lumbar. Therefore, we are left with A: Epigastric which is an anatomical region that lies just distal to the sternum.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
