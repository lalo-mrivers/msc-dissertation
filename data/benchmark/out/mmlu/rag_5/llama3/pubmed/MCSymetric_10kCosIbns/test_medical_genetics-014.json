["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents describe several cases of aneuploidy, including monosomy. Monosomy is the absence of one chromosome from a set of chromosomes. The document 'Full monosomy 21: a clinically recognizable syndrome?' describes a case of full monosomy 21, which is a complete loss of the 21st chromosome. Similarly, the document 'X monosomy and 21 trisomy in a sibship' mentions a case of 45,X, which is an example of X monosomy. The document 'Monosomy 21: a possible stepwise evolution of the karyotype' also describes cases of mosaic monosomy 21, where there are three different cell lines with different numbers of chromosomes. Finally, the document '[Diagnostic value of particular symptoms in monosomy X. Evaluated on the basis of experiences with 34 own cases (author's transl)]' mentions cases of 45,X and various forms of mosaicism, including monosomy X.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
