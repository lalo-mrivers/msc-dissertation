["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents mention the esophagogastric junction, which is the level of the lower esophageal sphincter. The study on the arterial vascularization of the esophagus mentions poor zones of vascularity in the middle of the ventral and dorsal plane, suggesting that this area may not have a rich blood supply. The study on the physiology and pathology of the esophagus mentions that the blood vessels derive from several sources, including the left gastric artery, but does not specifically mention which structures accompany the oesophagus through the diaphragm. However, the study on the development of the lymphatic bed of the human esophageal wall suggests that the perivascular lymphatic capillaries and vessels appear around 6 months of age, forming peculiar paths around arterioles, venules, arterial branches and venous tributaries. This implies that there is some kind of connection or relationship between these structures.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
