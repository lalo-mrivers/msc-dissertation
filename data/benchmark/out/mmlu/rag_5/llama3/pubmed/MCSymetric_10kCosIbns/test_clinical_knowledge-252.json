["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the regulation of glucose transport into muscle cells. It is stated that insulin increases the rate of entry of glucose into muscle over the entire range of plasma glucose concentrations studied (4-8 mumole ml.-1). This suggests that insulin plays a role in regulating glucose transport. The documents also mention the GLUT4 transporter isoform, which is normally found in the sarcolemmal (SL) membrane and is thought to be involved in glucose transport under basal conditions. With insulin stimulation, glucose transport is accelerated by translocating GLUT-4 transporters from an intracellular pool out to the T-tubule and SL membranes.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
