["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking which of the given options can act as an intracellular buffer to limit pH changes when the rate of glycolysis is high. The relevant documents describe how ATP produced by glycolysis is hydrolyzed by the membrane ATPase to generate a delta pH, and that FCCP stimulates ATP hydrolysis by ATPase and collapses the proton gradient. The 2.3P2G-bypass in human erythrocytes acts as an 'energy buffer', wasting ATP in case of ATP-overproduction and producing ATP in case of underproduction. This suggests that ATP can act as an intracellular buffer to limit pH changes when the rate of glycolysis is high.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
