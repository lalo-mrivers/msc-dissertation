["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the type of covalent bonds that link amino acids in a protein. The relevant documents describe peptide chains, secondary structures, and side-chain conformation. Hydrogen and hydrophobic bonds are mentioned as fixing angles of internal rotation, but these are not covalent bonds. Ionic bridges between adjacent peptide groups are considered, but they are also not covalent bonds. The Courtauld three-dimensional models show allowed conformations for all 20 natural amino acid residues, which suggests that the peptide chain is the main structure being studied. Therefore, the correct answer is A: Peptide bonds.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
