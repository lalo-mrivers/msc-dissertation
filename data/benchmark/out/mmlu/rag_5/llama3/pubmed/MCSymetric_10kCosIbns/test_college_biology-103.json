["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the given documents, we can see that DNase is used to digest a nucleosome dimer into nucleosome monomers. We know that DNase I, II, and staphylococcal nuclease cut at different yet symmetrically located sites in the nucleosome core. Each of these enzymes cleaves the DNA of chromatin at 10-nucleotide intervals (n integer). This specificity presumably reflects the internal structure of the nucleosome. The cutting sites of the three enzymes thus do not coincide, but each pair of staggered cuts is symmetrically located about a common axis-that is, the 'dyad axes' that bisect nearest pairs of cutting sites coincide for all three enzymes. This result is consistent with the presence of a true dyad axis in the nucleosome core. Therefore, the target of digestion of a nucleosome dimer to nucleosome monomers by DNase is likely to be the nucleosome core.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
