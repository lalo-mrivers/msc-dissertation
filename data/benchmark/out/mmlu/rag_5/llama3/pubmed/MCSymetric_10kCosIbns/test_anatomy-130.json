["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents provide information about the branching of sensory axons in the dorsal root, the morphology of spinal cord neurons contributing to ventral roots, and the physiology and anatomy of long-ranging afferent fibers within the spinal cord. From these documents, it is evident that the dorsal roots contain sensory axons that project into the dorsal horn. The branching of these axons in the dorsal root suggests that many dorsal root axons must branch in the dorsal root. Furthermore, the morphology of spinal cord neurons contributing to ventral roots shows that there are neurons with processes in the ventral roots that are presumed to be alpha and gamma motoneurons, which are motor neurons. The physiology and anatomy of long-ranging afferent fibers within the spinal cord also suggest that these fibers are sensory in nature, as they project from the dorsal root into the dorsal horn and have normal receptive fields in the dermatome of their parent dorsal root. Therefore, it is concluded that the dorsal roots contain sensory neuronal processes.\",\n\"answer_choice\": A"]
