["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, Alzheimer's disease is a complex disorder with both genetic and environmental factors contributing to its pathogenesis. The papers suggest that there may be multiple genes involved, including those linked to chromosome 21 and chromosome 19 in early-onset familial cases. Late-onset familial cases may have different genetic contributions. The risk of developing Alzheimer's disease also appears to increase with age.\n\nGiven these findings, it is reasonable to consider polygenic inheritance, where multiple genetic variants contribute to the development of the disease.\n\nThe relevant papers do not specifically identify the gene(s) responsible for polygenic Alzheimer's disease. However, one paper mentions a study that found abnormalities in the distribution of ABO-blood-groups and phenotypes in the third component of complement system, which may be related to the immune response.\n\nAnother paper discusses the genetics of Alzheimer's disease and notes that recent epidemiological and molecular genetic studies have shown that familial Alzheimer's disease is influenced by multiple genetic factors. This suggests that polygenic inheritance may play a role in the development of Alzheimer's disease.\n\nGiven the complexity of Alzheimer's disease and the presence of both genetic and environmental factors, it is reasonable to consider polygenic inheritance as a possible mechanism underlying this disorder.\n\nTherefore, based on these findings, I would conclude that there is no single gene that conveys susceptibility for polygenic Alzheimer's disease. Instead, multiple genetic variants may contribute to an individual's risk of developing the disease.\n\nThis conclusion is supported by the available data and the complexity of Alzheimer's disease.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
