["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the ability of the brain to detect differences in stimulus intensity. The relevant documents mention evoked brain potentials (EP) being studied in a psychophysical experiment and the maintenance of sensitivity at a constant level providing for precision of perception. This suggests that the EP parameters are in correspondence with the perceived brightness of stimuli, which depends on the intensity of stimulation and sensitivity of sensory input. Therefore, it is likely that the answer relates to the changes in brain potential amplitude or some other parameter that varies with stimulus intensity.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
