["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Firstly, we need to understand that the mean rate of oxygen consumption is given as 2 l/min. The provided documents give us a relationship between record time and maximal oxygen consumption (VO2max) in middle-distance running. The formula for calculating tr from VO2max is: tr = f(VO2max), where tr is the record time. As we are given the mean rate of oxygen consumption, which is 2 l/min, we can calculate the VO2max. In the document 'A simple relation between performance in running and maximal aerobic power', it is mentioned that the cost of running amounts to about 1 cal per m covered and per kg of body weight. Using this information, we can calculate the rate of energy expenditure.\",\n\"answer_choice\": A"]
