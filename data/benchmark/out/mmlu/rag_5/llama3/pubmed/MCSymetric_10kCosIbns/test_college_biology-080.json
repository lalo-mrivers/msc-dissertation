["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about similarities between cancer cells grown in culture and normal cells grown in culture. The provided documents discuss various aspects of cell cultures, including the establishment of human malignant tumour specimens in vitro, and the characteristics of cultured human cancer cells and tissues. Specifically, the document on Carcinogenesis in vitro mentions that untreated control cultures become terminal by the 20th generation, whereas continuous cell lines from altered foci demonstrate altered morphology, loss of contact inhibition, accelerated growth rate, and have attained over 240 generations in a period of 140 weeks. This suggests that cancer cells grown in culture can divide an indefinite number of times, unlike normal cells.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
