["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The passage does not provide direct information about the presence of chloroplasts in different organisms. However, it is mentioned that the mitochondrion did not originate from an endosymbiosis involving an aerobic bacterium, but rather arose by endosymbiosis in a much earlier, anaerobic period and was initially a photosynthetic organelle, analogous to the modern chloroplast. This suggests that chloroplasts may have evolved from an early mitochondrial-like structure. The passage also mentions that plants have both chloroplasts and mitochondria.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
