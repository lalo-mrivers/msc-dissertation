["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents describe homeobox genes, which are master control genes that determine the body plan. The discovery of these genes marks a new era in developmental biology. The documents also mention that over 30 murine homeobox genes have been cloned, with many showing sequence homology to Drosophila prototypes. This suggests that homeobox sequences are present in multiple animal species, including mice and flies.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
