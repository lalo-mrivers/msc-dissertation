["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, we know that awareness of high blood pressure increases sympathetic tone and responses as measured in the laboratory. Additionally, we see that informing the subjects of high blood pressure increases both baseline plasma noradrenaline and adrenaline. Furthermore, we have a study that shows exaggerated adrenaline responses to mental stress in individuals who are aware of their high blood pressure. Considering these findings, it's likely that awareness of high blood pressure could increase blood pressure further. This is supported by the fact that blood pressure (P less than 0.05) and heart rate (P less than 0.05) increased significantly more in the informed group when the subjects were told of the cold pressor test.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: Increased peripheral vascular resistance\"\n}"]
