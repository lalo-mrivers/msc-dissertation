["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the consequences of untreated maternal phenylketonuria on the developing fetus. The risk of abnormality is high, with reported cases showing microcephaly, mental retardation, and congenital malformations, including congenital heart disease. In particular, the document [Progeny, pregnancy and phenylketonuria] reports a case where the child of an untreated mother with phenylketonuria died at 14 days due to congenital heart disease. This suggests that the risk is significant. The document [Maternal phenylketonuria. Problems in detecting and risk educating identified females] also notes that leading symptoms include microcephaly, mental retardation, and congenital malformations. Furthermore, the document [Prenatal brain damage in maternal, untreated phenylketonuria] reports a case where the amino acid profile in amniotic fluid revealed a very high phenylalanine level, suggesting prenatal brain damage. Given these reports, it is reasonable to conclude that the risk of abnormality is significant.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
