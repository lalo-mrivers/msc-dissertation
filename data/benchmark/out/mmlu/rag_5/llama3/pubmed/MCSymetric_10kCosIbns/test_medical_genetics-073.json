["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for the normal human chromosome diploid number. We can find this information by looking at the parameters of the human genome document. According to this document, the autosomal size is 2809 centimorgans in males and 4782 centimorgans in females. Since we are not considering sex chromosomes, we will use the male value. The document also mentions that chromosome arm lengths are critical parameters of the human genome. Therefore, we can conclude that the normal human chromosome diploid number is 46.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
