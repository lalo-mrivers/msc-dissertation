["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the most likely result if alpha (α) is set at 0.01 instead of 0.05 in a placebo-controlled clinical trial assessing the effectiveness of a new antihypertensive drug. First, we need to understand that a lower α means that the test is more stringent and requires a larger difference between the treatment group and control group to be considered statistically significant. Since there are 5000 patients enrolled, we can assume that the study has a reasonable sample size. Given these conditions, we should focus on the effect of changing α from 0.05 to 0.01. The main impact would be an increase in the power of the test, making it more likely to detect statistically significant differences between groups. This is because the new drug group needs to demonstrate a larger difference compared to placebo to meet the stricter α criterion.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
