["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the conditions that increase muscle lactate production. We can rule out option C because the pH of the muscle is not mentioned as a factor affecting lactate production in any of the provided documents. Options B and A are also unlikely to be correct because they relate to pyruvate formation or oxygen availability, which are not directly related to lactate production. Therefore, we need to focus on option D, which suggests that glycolysis is activated at the onset of exercise, leading to increased muscle lactate production.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
