["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about targeting of a newly synthesized protein. The relevant documents mention recognition of nascent polypeptides for targeting and folding, which suggests that the signal peptide is involved. The documents also discuss site-directed mutagenesis, sequence re-ordering, hybrid protein formation, protein resurfacing, as well as synthetic adduction to polymers, which are techniques used to design and engineer proteins. None of these discussions suggest targeting a newly synthesized protein to a specific destination such as plasma membrane, lysosome, cytosol or chloroplast. However, the documents do mention that additional factors are required in vivo for folding and localization apart from the protein product itself. This suggests that the targeting information may be encoded in the amino acid sequence of the nascent polypeptide. Therefore, it is likely that a single signal peptide is sufficient to target the newly synthesized protein to its destination.\", \"answer_choice\": B}"]
