["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 42-year-old woman with an 8-week history of intermittent nausea and abdominal pain that occurs 20-30 minutes after eating. The pain extends from the epigastrium to the right upper quadrant and is sometimes felt in the right scapula, lasting about 30 minutes. No vomiting has occurred. Given this presentation, we should focus on identifying any potential causes of her symptoms. Duodenal ulcer was twice as common as gastric ulcer in a similar study, and pain provoked by eating suggests a high probability of duodenal ulcer. Therefore, an upper gastrointestinal series with small bowel follow-through (B) is the most appropriate next step in management.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
