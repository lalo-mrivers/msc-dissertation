["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the activity of creatine kinase. From the provided documents, we can see that muscle creatine kinase is a regulated allosteric enzyme. The allosteric properties are influenced by various effectors, including PEP and ADP. The data obtained indicate that muscle creatine kinase is desensitized with respect to FDP and PEP after a prolonged storage. Additionally, EDTA and EGTA stimulate the activity of creatine kinase to various extents by suppressing the inhibitory effect of Ca2+ ions.\",\n\"answer_choice\": A"]
