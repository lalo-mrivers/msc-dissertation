["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"There is no specific document that directly addresses the question about blood glucose concentration during 80-90 minutes of intermittent high intensity exercise. However, based on the information provided, we can make some educated guesses.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom 'Glucoregulatory and hormonal responses to repeated bouts of intense exercise in normal male subjects', we know that plasma glucose increased during EX1 (13 min) and peaked at 7.0 +/- 0.6 mmol/l in early recovery but decreased after EX2. This suggests that blood glucose levels can increase or decrease depending on the intensity and duration of exercise.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom 'Serum insulin and glucose response to graded exercise in adults', we know that serum GC (glucose concentrations) increased significantly during exercise in active subjects, whereas it remained relatively unchanged in sedentary subjects. This suggests that blood glucose levels can increase or decrease depending on the fitness level of the individual.\\r\\n\\r\\nGiven these hints, we can make an educated guess about what happens to blood glucose concentration during 80-90 minutes of intermittent high intensity exercise.\\r\\n\\r\\nConsidering the information from 'Adaptation of blood sugar regulation during individually adjusted muscular exercises. Effects of training', which states that a twenty minutes exercise at 50 to 70% of VO2 max is followed by an increase of glycemia, we can assume that longer and more intense exercise will lead to increased blood glucose levels.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, 'Effect of glucose on plasma glucagon and free fatty acids during prolonged exercise' suggests that glucose availability reduces exercise-induced glucagon secretion and FFA mobilization. This might lead to a decrease in blood glucose levels.\\r\\n\\r\\nBased on these considerations, we can assume that the blood glucose concentration during 80-90 minutes of intermittent high intensity exercise may frequently rise by 1 - 3 mM.\",\n\"answer_choice\": A"]
