["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents discuss messenger RNA synthesis, processing, and regulation in eukaryotes. The initial transcript is mentioned to be heterogeneous nuclear RNA (hnRNA) molecules containing one mRNA sequence. The molecular organization and genome expression in eukaryotes mention the existence of stable messenger-like 28S and 18S RNA's found in the nuclei. This information suggests that the initial transcript contains introns, which are later removed before translation occurs.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
