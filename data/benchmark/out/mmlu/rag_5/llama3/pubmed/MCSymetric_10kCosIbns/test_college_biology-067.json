["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The provided documents describe various plant cells, but none of them specifically mention programmed cell death. However, we can look for clues on whether a particular type of cell undergoes programmed cell death to become functional. The document 'Negative regulators of programed cell death' discusses the regulation of programmed cell death in animals, but it doesn't provide information about plants. The document 'Cell interactions in plants' mentions intercellular connections and development, but it's not directly related to programmed cell death. Therefore, we need to rely on general knowledge about plant cells.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
