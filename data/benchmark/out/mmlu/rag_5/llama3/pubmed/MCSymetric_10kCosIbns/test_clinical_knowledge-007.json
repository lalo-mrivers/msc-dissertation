["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, sodium bicarbonate ingestion has been shown to improve performance during anaerobic exercise of various durations (10-240 s) and repeated swimming events with significant rest intervals between events. It is also suggested that there are specific dosages of sodium bicarbonate that are useful as an ergogenic aid for anaerobic performance times. However, the study on the effects of induced alkalosis on swimming time trials found no significant differences in performance times as a result of sodium bicarbonate ingestion prior to swim competition consisting of significant rest intervals between events. Therefore, it can be concluded that sodium bicarbonate ingestion may have beneficial effects on exercise performance under certain conditions.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
