["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about which relative an individual is most likely to share a common HLA haplotype with. We know that the HLA system has three closely linked loci (HLA-A, HLA-B and HLA-C) situated on the chromosome C6. According to the documents, the antigens coded by the loci HLA-A and HLA-B are used routinely for paternity testing, but they cannot be considered as independent due to strong linkage disequilibrium between these two loci.\n\nGiven this information, we can infer that an individual is most likely to share a common HLA haplotype with their sibling, who also inherits the same genetic material from both parents. The documents do not mention any significant linkage disequilibrium between HLA and other relatives such as father, mother, or son, which suggests that siblings are more likely to share a common HLA haplotype.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
