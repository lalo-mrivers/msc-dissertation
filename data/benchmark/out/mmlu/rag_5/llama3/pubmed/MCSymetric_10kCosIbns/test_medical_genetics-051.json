["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Since the restriction enzyme recognizes a specific 4 base sequence in DNA, we need to determine how many times this sequence appears in the bacteriophage's genome. The genome size is 5,000 bp, which means it has approximately 1,250 (5000/4) 4-base sequences. Therefore, we would expect the restriction enzyme to cleave the double-stranded bacteriophage into about 1,250 fragments.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
