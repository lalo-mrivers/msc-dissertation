["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has a gunshot wound to the abdomen, with an entrance wound in the left upper quadrant and an exit wound laterally in the left axillary line. He is hypotensive (blood pressure of 70/40 mm Hg) and tachycardic (pulse of 120/min), suggesting hemorrhagic shock. The patient also has decreased breath sounds on the left, which may indicate a lung injury.
