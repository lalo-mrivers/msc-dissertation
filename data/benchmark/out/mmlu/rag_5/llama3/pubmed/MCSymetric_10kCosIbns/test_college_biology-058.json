["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the first group of animals to develop lung tissue adequate to support their respiratory requirements without supplementary gas exchange organs. Based on the provided documents, it seems that the study 'Postnatal development of the denervated lung in normoxia, hypoxia, or hyperoxia' discusses the postnatal development of the rat lung and how it adapts to different oxygen levels. This suggests that mammals are capable of developing lung tissue adequate for their respiratory requirements without supplementary gas exchange organs. Therefore, it is reasonable to infer that mammals were the first group of animals to develop lung tissue adequate to support their respiratory requirements without supplementary gas exchange organs.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
