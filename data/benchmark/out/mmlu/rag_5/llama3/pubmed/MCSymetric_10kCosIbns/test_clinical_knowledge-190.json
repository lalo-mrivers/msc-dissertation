["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about Selective Androgen Receptor Modulators (SARMs). SARMs are compounds that bind to the androgen receptor but do not convert to dihydrotestosterone (DHT) or estrogen. They can mimic the effects of natural steroids, antagonize their effects, or have a unique effect. The passage 'Androgen receptor phosphorylation, turnover, nuclear transport, and transcriptional activation' suggests that SARMs are non-steroid drugs that act on androgen receptors mimicking the effects of natural steroid hormones. This is supported by the passage 'Antiandrogenic steroidal sulfonyl heterocycles', which mentions that certain compounds can be used as anti-androgens.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
