["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about net primary productivity in terrestrial ecosystems. The relevant documents provided are unrelated to this topic. Therefore, we cannot find a direct answer based on the given information. However, we can consider general ecological principles and research findings.\n\nIn tropical regions, the availability of water and warm temperatures may foster photosynthesis, which could contribute to increased plant growth (Option C). Additionally, higher species diversity in these ecosystems might also lead to increased plant growth (Option A), as different plant species interact and co-evolve. Metabolic costs for plant growth are not directly related to tropical vs. temperate ecosystems.\n\nPredation pressure, which is expected to be higher in the tropics due to greater biodiversity, may not necessarily minimize herbivory, but could potentially affect plant productivity indirectly through trophic cascades.\n\nBased on general ecological knowledge and research findings, we can conclude that Option C: The availability of water and warm temperatures in the tropics fosters photosynthesis is the most plausible explanation for increased net primary productivity towards the tropics.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
