["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has recently undergone cadaveric renal transplantation and is experiencing malaise, muscle and joint pain, and temperatures to 38.4°C (101.1°F) for 3 days. The patient's serum creatinine concentration is 1.6 mg/dL, which is higher than the initial value of 0.8 mg/dL at the time of discharge. The patient is receiving cyclosporine and corticosteroids as part of his post-transplant regimen. A biopsy of the transplanted kidney shows intracellular inclusion bodies.
