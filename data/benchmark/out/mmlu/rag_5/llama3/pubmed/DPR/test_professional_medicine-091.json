["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The key to this question is understanding the concept of statistical power. Statistical power is the probability that a study will detect a statistically significant effect when one exists. In this case, the investigators set the probability of wrongly finding that Drug X is more effective than the standard therapy as 1% and the probability of wrongly finding that the effectiveness of the two drugs is the same as 10%. This means that they are willing to accept a certain level of false positives (1%) and false negatives (10%). To calculate the statistical power, we need to use the following formula: 1 - (alpha + beta), where alpha is the probability of wrongly finding an effect (1%) and beta is the probability of wrongly failing to find an effect (10%). Plugging in the values, we get: 1 - (0.01 + 0.10) = 0.89. Therefore, the statistical power of this study is approximately 90%.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: 90%\""]
