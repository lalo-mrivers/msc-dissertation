["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the effect of changing the alpha level from 0.05 to 0.01 on the clinical trial's outcome, we need to understand what alpha represents and how it affects statistical tests. Alpha is the probability of rejecting a true null hypothesis by chance. A lower alpha level means that the test becomes more conservative, requiring a larger difference between the treatment and control groups before considering the results statistically significant. With an alpha of 0.01, we would need to observe a more substantial effect size for the new antihypertensive drug compared to standard therapy in order for the results to be considered statistically significant. This would increase the likelihood of not detecting a true difference (Type II error).\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"]
