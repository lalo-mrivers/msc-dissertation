["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking what the ratio of A:T would be in the newly synthesized complementary strand of DNA if a section of the template strand had a ratio of 3:2 of A:T bases. Since DNA polymerase adds complimentary nucleotides to the template strand, we know that the ratio of A:T in the new strand will be the same as the ratio of T:A in the original template strand. Therefore, the ratio of A:T in the newly synthesized complementary strand is 2:3.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
