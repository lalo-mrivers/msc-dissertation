["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking what's necessary to calculate the sensitivity of this blood test. Sensitivity is defined as the proportion of true positives (people with prostate cancer) among all people who actually have the condition (true positives + false negatives). In this case, we're looking at men with serum prostate-specific antigen concentrations greater than 5 ng/mL. We need to know how many men in this group actually have prostate cancer and how many do not. The only relevant information provided is that one hundred men undergo biopsy procedures; 90 are found to have prostate cancer, and five are found to have chronic prostatitis. Therefore, we can calculate sensitivity by comparing the number of true positives (men with prostate cancer) among those who tested positive for prostate-specific antigen.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
