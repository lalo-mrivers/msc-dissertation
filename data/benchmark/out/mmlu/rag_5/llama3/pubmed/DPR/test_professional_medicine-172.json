["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To solve this problem, we need to understand how α-thalassemia is inherited. Each person has four copies of the α-globin gene (two from each parent), and each copy can have a deletion or be normal. The woman has a minimally decreased hemoglobin concentration due to a single gene deletion, which means she has three functional genes (2 normals + 1 normal). The man has microcytic anemia and a two-gene deletion, which means he has only one functional gene.\n\nIn a trans configuration, the couple's offspring will inherit one deletion from each parent. Since the woman has a single deletion, her offspring will inherit either a single deletion (from her) or no deletions (if they get a normal gene). The man, with two deletions, can only pass on one deletion to his offspring.\n\nIf an offspring inherits a deletion from both parents, it will have a two-gene deletion. Since the woman's offspring can inherit at most one deletion and the man's offspring must inherit at least one deletion (since he has two), this scenario is not possible. Therefore, no offspring will have a two-gene deletion.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
