["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the products of ADP degradation that increase in concentration during multiple sprint sports. ADP is converted to ATP through a process called purine nucleotide metabolism. The key players in this pathway are adenylate cyclase, phosphodiesterase, and 5'-nucleotidase. These enzymes convert ADP into AMP, IMP, hypoxanthine, xanthine, and eventually uric acid. Creatine is not directly related to the degradation of ADP. Ammonia is a byproduct of protein catabolism and is not a direct product of ADP degradation.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
