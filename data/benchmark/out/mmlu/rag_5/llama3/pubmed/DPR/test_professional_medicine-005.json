["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question describes a study where hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia are induced in healthy subjects. Muscle biopsy specimens show increased concentrations of malonyl-CoA during the resting state. Malonyl-CoA is an important regulator of muscle metabolism, known to directly inhibit fatty acid oxidation. Therefore, it is most likely that the increased malonyl-CoA concentration directly inhibits fatty acid oxidation.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
