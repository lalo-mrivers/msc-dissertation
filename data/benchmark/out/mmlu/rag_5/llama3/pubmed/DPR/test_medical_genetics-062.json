["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the likelihood of an individual carrying two specific alleles of a human DNA marker, we need to calculate the probability of each allele being present. Since each allele has a frequency of 0.2, the probability of one allele being present is also 0.2. To find the probability of both alleles being present, we need to multiply the probabilities together: 0.2 x 0.2 = 0.04. Therefore, the likelihood of an individual carrying two specific alleles of a human DNA marker is 0.04.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
