["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the body's compensation for increased environmental temperature. The relevant documents don't provide direct information on this topic. However, I can consider general physiological responses to heat stress. In hot environments, animals and humans tend to increase their water loss through sweating or panting to cool down. This process helps to dissipate excess heat from the body. Additionally, heart rate and respiration rate may also increase in response to heat stress as the body attempts to maintain homeostasis. Salt retention is not directly related to thermoregulation.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
