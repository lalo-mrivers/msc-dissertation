["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Fast-twitch fibers are a type of muscle fiber that is responsible for rapid, powerful movements. They are characterized by their high ATPase activity, which means they have a high level of enzyme activity that breaks down ATP to produce energy. The question asks about the characteristics of fast-twitch fibers, specifically the number of mitochondria and ATPase activity. We can eliminate option A because it describes slow-twitch fibers, which have low ATPase activity and many mitochondria. Options B and C are also eliminated because they both describe low ATPase activity. Therefore, we are left with option D, which describes fast-twitch fibers as having a relatively small number of mitochondria and high ATPase activity.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
