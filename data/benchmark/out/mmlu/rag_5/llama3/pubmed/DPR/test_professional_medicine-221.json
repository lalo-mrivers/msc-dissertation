["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with a 6-day history of fever, severe muscle pain, and diffuse, painful swelling. The symptoms began after returning from a camping trip in New Mexico. Physical examination shows generalized scattered black maculae and an erythematous, solid, tender mass on the underside of the upper extremity just above the elbow. The patient appears ill and lethargic. This presentation suggests Hanta virus disease, also known as hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS). The characteristic symptom is a fever that develops within 1-4 weeks after exposure to infected rodents or their urine.\n\nThe most effective antibiotic for this patientâ€™s disorder will interfere with cellular processes or enzymes. The correct answer is C: Proteasomal degradation.\n\nHanta virus disease is caused by the Sin Nombre virus, which belongs to the hantavirus genus. The virus infects cells through binding to proteasomes and inhibiting their activity. Proteasomal degradation is the process by which proteins are broken down into smaller peptides or individual amino acids. Inhibition of this process leads to the accumulation of misfolded proteins, which can cause cell death.\n\nIn contrast, DNA helicase (A) is an enzyme that unwinds double-stranded DNA during DNA replication and repair. Glucuronosyltransferase (B) is an enzyme involved in the metabolism of certain drugs and toxins. Ribosomal assembly (D) is the process by which ribosomes are formed from ribonucleoproteins.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
