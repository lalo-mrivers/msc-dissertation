["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is related to exercise physiology. The relevant document 'Responsiveness to laboratory pain in women as a function of age and childbirth pain experience' doesn't provide information about anaerobic contribution, pH levels or blood glucose concentration in response to increasing number of sprints. Therefore, we need to look for another document that provides the necessary information. After reviewing the documents, I found that 'Neuromuscular electrical stimulation and voluntary exercise' discusses the effects of neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) on muscle physiology. Although NMES is not directly related to increasing number of sprints, it does provide some relevant information about anaerobic metabolism. According to the document, NMES specifically induces the activity of large motor units which are more difficult to activate during voluntary contraction. This suggests that as the intensity or frequency of exercise increases, there may be a greater reliance on anaerobic metabolism.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
