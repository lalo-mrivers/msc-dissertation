["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about a 4-year-old girl who has a grade 2/6 systolic ejection murmur along the upper left sternal border, a soft mid-diastolic murmur along the lower left sternal border, and a widely split S2 that does not vary with respiration. The exam shows no other abnormalities. Aortic stenosis is unlikely due to the presence of a systolic ejection murmur and no other signs of cardiac disease. Coarctation of the aorta is also unlikely as there are no other findings such as hypertension or diminished femoral pulses. Mitral valve prolapse can cause mid-diastolic murmurs but is less likely to cause a grade 2/6 systolic ejection murmur. Atrial septal defect is the most likely diagnosis due to the presence of a widely split S2 and a soft mid-diastolic murmur.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
