["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the rate of energy expenditure of a male athlete during a training session. The mean rate of oxygen consumption is given as 2 l/min. Energy expenditure can be calculated using the Weir's formula, which states that energy expenditure (in kJ) is equal to 5 + 21.6 * VO2 (in ml/min), where VO2 is the volume of oxygen consumed per minute.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the given rate of oxygen consumption from l/min to ml/min. There are 1000 milliliters in 1 liter, so 2 l/min = 2000 ml/min.\n\nThen, using Weir's formula, we can calculate the energy expenditure:\n\nEnergy expenditure (in kJ) = 5 + 21.6 * 2000\n= 5 + 43,200\n= 43,205\n\nFinally, since there are 1000 kilojoules in 1 megajoule, we can convert the energy expenditure from kJ to MJ:\n\nEnergy expenditure (in MJ) = 43,205 / 1000\n= 43.21 MJ\n\nNow, we need to find the corresponding answer choice that is closest to our calculated value.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
