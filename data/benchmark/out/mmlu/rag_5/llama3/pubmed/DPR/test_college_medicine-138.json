["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"There is no relevant information about Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) or cell types arising from myeloid progenitor cells in the provided documents. The documents discuss topics such as laparoscopic cholecystectomy, quality and audit in occupational health, patient instruction sheets, and campaigning for change.

Therefore, we need to rely on general knowledge of hematology and the characteristics of myeloid progenitor cells to answer this question.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
