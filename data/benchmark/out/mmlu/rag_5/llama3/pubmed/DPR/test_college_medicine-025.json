["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, we need to identify the original DNA sequence. It's a segment of DNA from a lab mouse: 5’ – GGATCCTCATG – 3’. Then, we can think about what would happen if both a point mutation and a deletion occurred in this original DNA sequence.\n\nA point mutation is when one nucleotide base is replaced by another. In this case, let's say the C at position 2 becomes a T. This would result in the following DNA segment: 5’ – GGATTTCTCATG – 3’.\n\nNow, let's consider a deletion. A deletion occurs when one or more nucleotides are removed from the original sequence. In this case, let's say we remove three nucleotides starting from position 4. This would result in the following DNA segment: 5’ – GGATCTCATG – 3’.\n\nThe combination of these two events (a point mutation and a deletion) would result in the final DNA segment: 5’ – GGATCTCATG – 3’. This is option D.\n\nTherefore, our answer choice should be D.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
