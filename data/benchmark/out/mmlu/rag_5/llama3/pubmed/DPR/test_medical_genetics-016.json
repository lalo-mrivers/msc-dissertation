["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"In a mating between two AaBbCc individuals, the possible genotypes are AABBCC, aaBBcc, AA'bb'Cc', etc. The frequency of AABBCC individuals can be calculated by considering the probability of each individual receiving an 'A' or 'a', 'B' or 'b', and 'C' or 'c'. Since each allele is equally likely to be expressed, the frequency of AABBCC individuals would be 1/64.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
