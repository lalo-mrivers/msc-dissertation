["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the structure of performance enhancing synthetic steroids. None of the provided documents mention steroids or their structures. However, we can rule out some options based on general knowledge. Testosterone (A) and cortisol (B) are both naturally occurring hormones in humans, but they are not typically associated with performance enhancement. Progesterone (C) is also a naturally occurring hormone, and aldosterone (D) is an adrenal hormone involved in electrolyte balance. There is no clear link between any of these hormones and synthetic steroids for performance enhancement. Therefore, we can focus on the documents' content and look for connections to other medical conditions or processes that might involve steroids.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
