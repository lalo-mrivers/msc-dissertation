["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about a healthy 22-year-old man who has eaten an 800-calorie meal and then slept through the night without additional food or drink. His serum glucose concentration remains within the reference range after 12 hours. This suggests that the body's glucose levels have been maintained, likely due to the initial meal having provided enough energy for a period of time.\n\nConsidering the options, it is unlikely that 'Continued gut absorption of calories from the ingested meal' (A) would be responsible for maintaining serum glucose concentration after 12 hours. Similarly, 'Increased leptin release from adipose tissues' (D) does not seem directly related to glucose metabolism.\n\nThis leaves us with two possibilities: 'Glucose release from skeletal muscle' (B) and 'Glycogenolysis in the liver' (C).\n\nThe key point is that the man's serum glucose concentration remains within the reference range, indicating that his body has adapted to maintain normal glucose levels. This suggests that the liver is playing a role in maintaining glucose homeostasis.\n\nLiver glycogen stores are broken down during fasting to release glucose into the bloodstream, a process known as glycogenolysis. This process helps to maintain normal blood glucose concentrations during periods of caloric deprivation.\n\nTherefore, it is most likely that 'Glycogenolysis in the liver' (C) is responsible for maintaining the man's serum glucose concentration.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
