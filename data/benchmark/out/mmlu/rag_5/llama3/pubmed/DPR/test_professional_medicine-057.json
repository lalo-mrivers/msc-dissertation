["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has a 3-week history of fever and warm, red lumps under both arms. The physical examination shows enlarged, erythematous axillary lymph nodes bilaterally that are tender, fluctuant, and movable. A fine-needle aspirate from one of the nodes shows gram-positive cocci in clusters. Cultures of the aspirate grow yellow, β-hemolytic colonies that are catalase and coagulase positive. The polymerase chain reaction test shows mecA-positive organisms.\n\nThe patient has a bacterial infection, specifically Staphylococcus aureus. The mecA gene is present in methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Therefore, the most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient would be an antibiotic that is effective against MRSA.\n\nRifampin and vancomycin are both antibiotics that are effective against MRSA, but ciprofloxacin is not. Penicillin G is not effective against MRSA as it is a β-lactam antibiotic and the mecA gene confers resistance to β-lactam antibiotics.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient would be rifampin or vancomycin.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: Vancomycin\""]
