["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the complementary DNA strand sequence, we need to find the base pairing rules between A-T and G-C. Since CGA is a region of 3 nucleotides, we can start by looking for the complement of C (which is G), followed by the complement of G (which is C) and finally the complement of A (which is T). The sequence would be: 5'GCTAC'... As for TTG, we have to find the complement of each nucleotide. For T, it's A, for T it's also A. So the sequence would be: 3'AAC'. Putting both together, we get: 5'GCTAAC' which is choice B.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
