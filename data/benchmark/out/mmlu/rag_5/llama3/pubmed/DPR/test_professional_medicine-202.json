["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 15-year-old girl with elevated blood pressure (150/90 mm Hg) and no symptoms or history of serious illness. She has been tracked over three separate occasions since the last visit, and her blood pressure remains elevated. Her examination is normal, and urinalysis, cardiac, and renal ultrasonography all show no abnormalities. Given these findings, it's likely that the patient's hypertension is primary rather than secondary to another condition.\n\nThe next step in management should focus on determining the underlying cause of the hypertension. Exercise and weight reduction are good habits for overall health but may not directly address the patient's blood pressure issues.\n\nMeasurement of urine catecholamine concentrations could provide insight into whether the patient's hypertension is related to sympathetic nervous system activity, which would be an important finding.\n\nCorticosteroids have no direct relationship to blood pressure regulation, so measuring urine corticosteroid concentrations would not be relevant in this case.\n\nCaptopril therapy is a treatment for hypertension, but it's not the most appropriate next step in management without further investigation into the underlying cause of the patient's hypertension. Therefore, the most likely correct answer is B: Measurement of urine catecholamine concentrations.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
