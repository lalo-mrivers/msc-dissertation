["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the symptoms presented (band-like, burning pain in the right upper abdomen extending to the midline of the back) and the normal findings on ultrasonography of the gallbladder and serum amylase concentration being within reference range, I think step-by-step: The patient does not have biliary colic or pancreatitis. The abdominal tenderness is absent which suggests that this is not a typical inflammatory process. Given the involvement of the back, herpes zoster (shingles) comes to mind. However, the normal gallbladder ultrasound rules out acute cholecystitis. Diverticulitis of the cecum would typically present with abdominal tenderness and possibly mass effect on the surrounding viscera. Acalculous cholecystitis is also unlikely given the normal gallbladder ultrasound. Therefore, I think the most likely diagnosis is herpes zoster.\", \"answer_choice\": D}"]
