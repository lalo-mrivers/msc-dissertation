["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Given the patient's symptoms of moderately severe headaches that are present when he awakens in the morning and relieved with over-the-counter analgesics, it is important to consider potential causes. The blurring of the optic disc margins bilaterally suggests a possibility of elevated intracranial pressure or optic nerve compression. Considering the patient's recent promotion and relocation, it is also possible that this could be related to stress or other psychological factors.\n\nThe CT scan of the head is the most appropriate next step because it can help evaluate for any structural abnormalities that may be causing his symptoms.
