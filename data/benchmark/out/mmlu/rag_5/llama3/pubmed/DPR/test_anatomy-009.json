["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the primary motor cortex activity. The provided documents don't seem to directly relate to the primary motor cortex or its function. However, upon reviewing the case report on midline cervical cleft, it does not provide any information that would help answer this specific question. The other documents appear to be unrelated to the topic as well. Therefore, I will focus on the anatomical and physiological aspects of the primary motor cortex.
