["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"In Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the frequency of an X-linked recessive disorder is determined by the allele frequencies at the relevant locus. Since the incidence of affected males equals 1 in 100, we can infer that the frequency of the recessive allele (r) is equal to q = 0.01. The frequency of the dominant allele (R) is therefore p = 0.99. For an X-linked recessive disorder, a female is affected only if she inherits two copies of the recessive allele, i.e., rr. Since the alleles are inherited in a Mendelian fashion, the probability of a female inheriting rr is given by the square of the frequency of the recessive allele: p(rr) = q^2 = 0.01^2 = 1/10000.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C: 1 in 10 000\""]
