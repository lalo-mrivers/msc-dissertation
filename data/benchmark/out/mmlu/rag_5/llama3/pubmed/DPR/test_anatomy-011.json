["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the effects of damage to the third cranial nerve (oculomotor nerve). The third cranial nerve controls the movement of the eye, including pupil constriction and extraocular muscle movements. Damage to this nerve can cause abnormalities in these functions. The patient's orbit has been damaged in a road traffic incident, which means that the third cranial nerve is likely to be affected. This suggests that the patient will have pupillary constriction as the pupils are controlled by the third cranial nerve. As for strabismus, damage to the third cranial nerve can cause lateral strabismus (eye deviating outward) because the medial rectus muscle which pulls the eye inward is paralyzed.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
