["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the point at which natality (birth rate) and mortality rates are equal to one another. This concept is related to population growth. The relevant documents provided do not directly discuss population growth or demographics, except for the 'Motivation for vasectomy' document which discusses family size and recent pregnancy, but it does not specifically mention the point at which natality and mortality rates are equal. However, the other documents provide information on different medical topics such as gonorrhea, immunotherapy, antibiotic resistance, and glycogen levels in rat ova during cleavage. None of these topics directly relate to population growth or the concept described in the question. Therefore, the answer must be found elsewhere.\", \"answer_choice\": C}"]
