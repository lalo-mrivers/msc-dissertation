["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the optimality theory from an evolutionary perspective. We need to find which option best represents this idea. The options provide different conditions for a trait to persist in the genome. Option A mentions that if the benefits exceed the cost, the trait will persist. Option B talks about the best return for the cost relative to alternative forms of the trait. Option C states that beneficial traits are always worth the cost, so they will persist. Option D requires an improvement in fitness due to a specific trait. From this analysis, we can infer that the optimality theory is more concerned with the efficiency or effectiveness of a trait rather than its mere presence or benefit.\", \"answer_choice\": B}"]
