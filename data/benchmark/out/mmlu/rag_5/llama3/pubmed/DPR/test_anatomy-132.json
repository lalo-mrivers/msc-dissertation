["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about loss of somatic sensation over the anterior two-thirds of the tongue. This suggests that the nerves involved are those related to the tongue's sensations. The mandibular trigeminal nerve has a lingual branch, but it is not specific to the anterior two-thirds of the tongue. The chorda tympani branch of the facial nerve innervates part of the tongue, but its area of supply does not match the described loss of sensation. The glossopharyngeal nerve has a lingual branch that supplies the posterior one-third of the tongue, which is not relevant to this case. Therefore, the remaining option, D: hypoglossal nerve, seems the most likely candidate.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
