["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about embryology and the development of a vertebrate organism. The options provided are statements related to the concept of ontogeny (the study of development) and phylogeny (the study of evolutionary history). Based on this, I would analyze each option step by step.\\nOption A refers to the idea that an embryo's developmental stages recapitulate the evolutionary history of its species. This is a fundamental principle in embryology and is supported by scientific evidence. Therefore, it is justified to draw this conclusion as an embryologist studying the development of a vertebrate organism.\\nOptions B, C, and D are not directly related to the concept of ontogeny recapitulating phylogeny and therefore are less likely to be correct answers.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
