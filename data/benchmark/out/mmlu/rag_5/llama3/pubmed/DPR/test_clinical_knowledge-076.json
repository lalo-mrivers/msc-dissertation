["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Understanding stroke volume regulation requires knowledge of the factors that influence cardiac output. Preload refers to the initial stretching of the heart muscle, contractility is the ability of the heart muscle to squeeze blood out, and afterload is the resistance against which the heart pumps. Blood volume is not a direct regulator of stroke volume. Therefore, the correct answer must include preload, contractility, and afterload.\", \"answer_choice\": B}"]
