["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is experiencing urticaria, which is a type of allergic reaction. Since this is her first episode and it has resolved several times in the past week, it's likely that she will experience more episodes. Therefore, we need to identify the underlying cause of the urticaria. The history and physical examination disclose no abnormalities, so we can't rely on physical findings or laboratory tests that might be abnormal.
