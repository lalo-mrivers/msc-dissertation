["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the typical characteristics of normal somatic cells of a human male. The main point to consider is that this refers to the cells outside of the reproductive system, i.e., not gametes or germline cells. One key characteristic is that these cells are diploid, meaning they have two sets of chromosomes, 23 pairs in total.\n\nThe question also mentions autosomes, which are non-sex chromosomes. Since we're dealing with a human male, all his somatic cells will have an X and Y chromosome (XY).\n\nFrom the provided documents, there's no mention of X-inactivation or any specific information about somatic cell genetics. However, it's important to note that the World trends in health care delivery document doesn't provide relevant information for this question.\n\nThe key point is that human males' somatic cells typically have 44 autosomes and a diploid nucleus, which means they have two sets of chromosomes (23 pairs). The presence or absence of an X chromosome isn't the primary characteristic being asked about.\", \n\"answer_choice\": D"]
