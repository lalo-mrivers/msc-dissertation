["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents provided do not contain information about muscle fibers or their relaxation. However, we can consider the general physiology of muscle contraction and relaxation. Muscle contraction occurs when actin binding sites are uncovered, allowing for the sliding filament mechanism to occur. Relaxation occurs when the nerve stimulus is removed, causing the calcium channels to close and the muscle to relax.\",\n\"answer_choice\": A"]
