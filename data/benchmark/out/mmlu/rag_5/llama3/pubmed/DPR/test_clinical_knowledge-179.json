["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the initial energy source for very high force contractions lasting 1-2 seconds. We need to consider the energy sources available during this duration. Glycolysis takes around 30-90 minutes to produce ATP, so it's not relevant here. Creatine phosphorylation and phosphocreatine stores are both related to rapid ATP production. Phosphocreatine is rapidly depleted in high-intensity activities lasting seconds. Creatine phosphorylation replenishes phosphocreatine stores. Therefore, the initial energy source for very high force contractions is likely to be phosphocreatine stores or creatine phosphorylation.\", \"answer_choice\": C}"]
