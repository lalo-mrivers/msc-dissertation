["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"During exercise, there is a significant increase in heart rate and cardiac output. As the exercise session nears its end, the body begins to adapt to the demands of exercise by increasing stroke volume to compensate for the increased demand on the heart. This leads to an increase in pulse pressure (the difference between systolic and diastolic blood pressures). However, as the exercise is nearing its end, the body starts to wind down, and the increases in cardiac output and stroke volume begin to plateau or even decrease. As a result, one would expect a decrease in stroke volume during the last minute of exercise compared to the measurement before the session.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
