["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the development of the bones of the viscerocranium. I will search through the provided documents for relevant information on the development of the skull or viscerocranium. After reviewing the texts, I did not find any direct information on this specific topic. However, I found that osteochondromas are a type of bone tumor that can occur in various parts of the skeleton, including the skull and spine (document 1). This suggests that the bones of the viscerocranium may develop through a process similar to the development of other bones in the body. I will now consider the possible ways in which the bones of the viscerocranium could develop initially. I found information on different types of bone development, such as endochondral ossification and intramembranous ossification (document 1). Based on this information, I will evaluate each option to determine which one is most likely to be correct.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"]
