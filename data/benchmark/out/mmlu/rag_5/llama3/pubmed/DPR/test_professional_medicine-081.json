["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The investigator is studying the incidence of the common cold among medical students during finals week. It's hypothesized that stress affects the immune system making them more susceptible to infection. To support this hypothesis, we need to identify a laboratory finding that indicates compromised immunity. Stress typically leads to increased cortisol levels, not decreased. Macrophage activity and lymphocyte count are also unlikely to be affected by stress in a way that would compromise immunity. Basophil counts can increase in response to allergens or anaphylaxis, which is unrelated to the hypothesized mechanism of immune suppression due to stress. Therefore, the most likely finding to support this hypothesis is increased cortisol levels.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
