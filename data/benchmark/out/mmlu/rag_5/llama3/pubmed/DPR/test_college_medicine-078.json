["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The scientist is stimulating a group of neurons in the hypothalamus and recording their membrane potential changes. Initially, there's a sharp rise in membrane potential (100mV) upon stimulation, indicating depolarization. When she tries another stimulation immediately after the first, there's no response, suggesting that the neurons have already repolarized to their resting state. However, when she increases the amount of voltage for the second shock, it still elicits a similar response to the first, implying that the neurons are still in an excitable state. This suggests that the second shock is not during the resting potential phase.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
