["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Attachment theory suggests that the attachment figure is determined by the caregiver's gender, not the child's. Therefore, we can eliminate choices A, B, D since they all involve female or mixed caregivers. The remaining option C, an eight-month-old male infant raised in a single-caregiver household where the caregiver frequently neglects the child, suggests a high level of stress and uncertainty which would lead to insecure attachment. Since the question asks about attaching to a male psychologist, we can infer that the child's attachment style would not be significantly influenced by this new figure, but rather their overall experience with caregivers.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"]
