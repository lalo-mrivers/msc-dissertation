["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Fibers are classified into two main types - slow-twitch (Type I) and fast-twitch (Type II). Slow-twitch fibers have a high number of mitochondria and low ATPase activity, while fast-twitch fibers have the opposite characteristics. Fast-twitch fibers are further divided into Type IIa and Type IIb, with Type IIa having more glycolytic capacity and Type IIb having more oxidative capacity.\", \"answer_choice\": D}"]
