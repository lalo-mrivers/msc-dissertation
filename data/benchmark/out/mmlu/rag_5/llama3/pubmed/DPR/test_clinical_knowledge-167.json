["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents provided are research papers discussing various topics in immunology. None of the papers mention DNA or its components. Therefore, we need to look at the question itself and identify what it is asking about. The question asks which molecule does not form part of DNA. This implies that the other options must be components of DNA. A quick analysis reveals that purine and pyrimidine are both components of nucleotides, deoxyribose is a sugar molecule found in DNA, and amino acid is a building block of proteins, not DNA. Based on this information, we can conclude that the correct answer is D: Amino acid.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
