["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The concept of niches is relevant to this question. The fundamental niche refers to the full range of environmental conditions under which a species can survive and reproduce. The realistic niche is the subset of the fundamental niche that is actually occupied by the species. Since the birds are making their homes only in the treetops due to the presence of an aggressive bird species on the cliff ledges, it means they are not occupying their entire fundamental niche (i.e., the cliff ledges).
