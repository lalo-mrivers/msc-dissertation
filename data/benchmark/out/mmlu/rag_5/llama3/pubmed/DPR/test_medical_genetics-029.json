["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the probability of each child being affected with an autosomal recessive disorder if both parents are affected. Autosomal recessive disorders follow a Mendelian inheritance pattern, where the affected individuals are homozygous for the recessive allele. Since both parents are affected, they must be homozygous for the recessive allele. Therefore, each child will inherit two copies of the recessive allele (one from each parent) and will also be affected with the disorder.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B: 1 in 2\""]
