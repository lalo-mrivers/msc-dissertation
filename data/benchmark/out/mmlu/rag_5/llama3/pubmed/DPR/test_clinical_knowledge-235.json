["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"This question is about the effect of exercise on blood glucose concentration. Since there are no relevant documents provided that discuss the topic, we need to rely on general knowledge or research outside of these documents.

However, this effect is typically short-lived and may not be significant during 80-90 minutes of exercise.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
