["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is an 87-year-old woman with progressive memory loss over the past 2 years. She has a Mini-Mental State Examination score of 23/30, which indicates mild cognitive impairment. Her laboratory studies are within normal limits, including vitamin B12 (cyanocobalamin), thyroxine (T4), and thyroid-stimulating hormone concentrations. The patient's physical examination is within normal limits for her age, but she has a history of vulvar cancer treated with wide excision 10 years ago.
