["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about processes that modify protein structure after translation has occurred. Lipidation is a process where lipids are attached to proteins, which can affect their structure and function. Attachment of more amino acids via peptide bonds is not a common mechanism for modifying protein structure, as it would require a separate translation event. Glycosylation refers to the attachment of sugars to proteins, which can also impact their structure and function. Phosphorylation is a process where phosphate groups are attached to proteins, which can regulate their activity.\n\nAfter reviewing the relevant documents, I did not find any information that suggests attaching more amino acids via peptide bonds after translation has occurred. Therefore, the answer would be B: Attachment of more amino acids via peptide bonds.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
