["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the characteristics of a species of small rodent that eats seeds from only one species of pine. The litter size of this rodent is unusual for its kind, being only 2-3. This suggests that there may be high parental investment in this species, as the parents are investing more energy and resources into fewer offspring. This would also imply that the young are not very independent at birth (precocial), requiring more care from their parents. The small litter size is likely due to the rodent's specific diet, which might be limited by the availability of seeds from a single pine species.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
