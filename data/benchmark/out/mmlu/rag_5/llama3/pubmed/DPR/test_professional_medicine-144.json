["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with intermittent shooting pain over her right cheek and jaw triggered by various stimuli. The duration of each episode is very brief, lasting only 1 second or less. Given the nature of the pain and its triggers, a diagnosis of trigeminal neuralgia (TN) is likely. TN is typically characterized by sharp, electric shock-like pains in the face, often triggered by daily activities such as chewing, brushing teeth, or even just breathing. The patient's medical history of tension headaches and gastric bypass surgery does not provide any clear alternative explanation for her symptoms.\n\nThe patient's physical examination reveals no facial weakness or loss of sensation, which further supports a diagnosis of TN. CT scan results are normal, ruling out any underlying structural abnormalities that may be contributing to the pain. Given these findings, pharmacotherapy targeting the trigeminal nerve is the most appropriate course of action.\n\nAmong the options, carbamazepine (A) is the most commonly used medication for treating TN due to its ability to stabilize aberrant firing patterns in the trigeminal nerve.\",\n\"answer_choice\": A"]
