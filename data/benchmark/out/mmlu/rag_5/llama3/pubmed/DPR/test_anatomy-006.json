["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the anatomical region of abdomen that lies just distal to the sternum. The term 'distal' means further away from a reference point. In this case, the reference point is the sternum. Considering the relevant documents, there are no references to the ventral neck or midline cervical cleft in the context of abdominal anatomy. Similarly, organs for transplantation and spontaneous subcapsular hematoma of the kidney do not provide any information about the region of abdomen distal to the sternum. However, congenital pulmonary lymphangioma involving the entire left lower lobe can be a clue to this question. Considering the anatomy of the lung, the left lower lobe is located posteriorly and does not lie distally to the sternum. A different anatomical structure that lies just distal to the sternum is the liver. The liver is situated in the epigastric region, which is further away from the sternum than the other regions listed.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A: Epigastric\"\n}"]
