["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To calculate the energy expended, we need to convert the athlete's steady-rate oxygen uptake from liters per minute (L/min) to milliliters per kilogram per minute (mL/kg/min). We can use the conversion factor of 22.4 mL/L to do this. Then, we need to multiply the result by the weight of the athlete in kilograms. Finally, we can use the energy expenditure equation: energy = 5 * (3.0 L/min) * 22.4 mL/L * 0.001 kcal/mL * 1000 J/kcal. Plugging in the values, we get approximately 500 kJ.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
