However, we can look at the document on glycosylated and unglycosylated recombinant-derived human stem cell factors. It describes the characterization of soluble forms of recombinant human SCF purified from Escherichia coli (unglycosylated) and from Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells (glycosylated). There is no mention of oxygen usage in this process. Therefore, we cannot find a direct connection between oxygen and the provided choices.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
