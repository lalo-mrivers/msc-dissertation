["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The molecule is acting by binding to cytochrome oxidase A3, which is the final enzyme in the electron transport chain. This means that the energy from aerobic respiration is being blocked. Without oxygen, cells can't undergo oxidative phosphorylation and produce ATP through the process of chemiosmosis. Therefore, the cell's ability to generate energy will be impaired.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
