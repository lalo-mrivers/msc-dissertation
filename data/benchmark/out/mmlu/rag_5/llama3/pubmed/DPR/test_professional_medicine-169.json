["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about a patient with squamous cell carcinoma of the lung who receives radiation therapy. Despite therapy, the tumor progressively increases in size and dies 6 months later. The key finding is that the tumor cells contain a point mutation in the p53 gene (TP53), leading to an inactive gene product. This suggests that there is a defect in cell cycle arrest. The cell cycle phases are G0, G1, S, G2, and M. Radiation therapy primarily affects cells in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle. Therefore, it is likely that the progressive tumor growth despite irradiation therapy is most likely related to a defect in cell cycle arrest in the G2/M phase.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
