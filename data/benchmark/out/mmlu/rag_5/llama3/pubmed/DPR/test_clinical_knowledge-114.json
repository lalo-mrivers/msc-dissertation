["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about an allele that is masked. The relevant documents are not discussing genetics or alleles, so we need to look outside the provided texts. Upon reviewing the question options, I notice that A: recessive seems to fit the context of genetic masking. In genetics, a recessive allele is one that will only be expressed if an individual has two copies of the allele (homozygous). If an individual has one copy of the recessive allele and one copy of a dominant allele, the dominant allele will mask the effects of the recessive allele.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
