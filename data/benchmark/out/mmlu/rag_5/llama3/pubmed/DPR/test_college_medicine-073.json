["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"When Mg(OH)2 is slowly dissolved in 500 mL of 25Â°C water until the solution becomes fully saturated, it means that the maximum amount of Mg(OH)2 has been dissolved and the solution can't hold any more. Adding 10.0 mL of 0.1 M HCl will react with the OH- ions to form H2O and decrease the concentration of OH-. Since the system is already fully saturated, adding HCl will cause some of the Mg(OH)2 to precipitate out as it loses its solubility.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
