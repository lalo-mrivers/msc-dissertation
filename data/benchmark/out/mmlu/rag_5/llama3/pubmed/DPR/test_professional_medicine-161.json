["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about a study design to evaluate the feasibility of acupuncture in children with chronic headaches. The study recruits 60 children with chronic headaches and treats them with acupuncture three times a week for 2 months. This suggests that the study follows multiple cases over time, which rules out options A (case-control) and D (cross-sectional).

Therefore, the most likely option is C (crossover), as it involves a controlled intervention.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
