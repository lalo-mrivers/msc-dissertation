["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 72-year-old man who has undergone an uncomplicated left total knee replacement. He is receiving fentanyl for pain management and has a medical history of coronary artery disease, hypertension, and heart failure. He is at risk of developing deep venous thrombosis (DVT) due to his age, immobility after surgery, and prior medical conditions. The American College of Chest Physicians recommends that patients at high risk of DVT receive low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) or fondaparinux prophylactically. Given the patient's history of heart failure and hypertension, it is likely that he would benefit from a regimen that takes into account his bleeding risks.
