["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Since I'm looking for the coding sequences of genes, I need to identify the relevant information from the provided documents. None of the documents mention 'extrons', 'introns', or 'codons'. Therefore, I'll focus on the document about regulation of IgE synthesis by cytokines, which talks about mechanisms underlying human IgE synthesis. In genetics, an exon is a part of a gene that codes for the final product (protein) while intron is non-coding region. This information suggests that exons are indeed coding sequences of genes. Therefore, I can confidently conclude that\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
