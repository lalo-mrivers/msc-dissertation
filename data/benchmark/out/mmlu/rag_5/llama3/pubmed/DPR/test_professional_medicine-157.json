["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about what would have happened if the same study had been conducted on a smaller population of 500 patients. Since the alpha value (0.05) remains the same, the chance of a type I error also remains the same. The beta value (0.20) represents the probability of type II error. As the sample size decreases, the probability of type II error increases. This means that with a smaller population, it would be more difficult to detect a statistically significant difference between the new drug and standard treatment.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
