["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the relationship between sexual dimorphism (differences) in primates and competition. Since there are no relevant documents provided that directly address primate sexual dimorphism or competition, I will look for indirect clues. One document mentions Neisseria gonorrhoeae, a bacterium that infects humans. Another document discusses Rickettsia prowazeki, a bacterial pathogen. These pathogens have nothing to do with primates, but they are both bacteria, which are single-celled organisms. This suggests that the question might be related to animal reproduction or mating behavior rather than food competition. The only relevant document mentioning animals is the case report about Schmorl's node in humans. However, it does not provide information about sexual dimorphism or primate species. Therefore, I will look at the abstract of the last document, which discusses immunological mechanisms for tumor prevention and immuno therapy. It does not provide any information about primates either. In summary, there is no direct evidence to support a conclusion about intense competition between males in order to obtain individual food resources or mates. However, since the question mentions sexual dimorphism in primates, I will look at the available documents again. One document discusses Neisseria gonorrhoeae, which infects humans, not primates. Another document talks about Rickettsia prowazeki, a bacterial pathogen that does not provide any information about primate behavior or reproduction. The last two documents are irrelevant to the question. Therefore, I will rely on general knowledge and biological principles to make an educated guess. Sexual dimorphism in primates is often associated with intense competition for mates rather than food resources.\", \"answer_choice\": B}"]
