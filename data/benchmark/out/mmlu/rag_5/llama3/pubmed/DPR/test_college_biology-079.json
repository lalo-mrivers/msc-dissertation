["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the cross between a tall violet plant (genotype DDWw) and a dwarf white plant. Since the allele for tall plants is completely dominant to the allele for dwarf plants, all the offspring from this cross will be tall. The allele for violet flower color is also completely dominant to the allele for white flower color, so all the offspring will have violet flowers or white flowers. Therefore, we can predict the phenotypic ratio of the progeny as follows: If we assume that the alleles W and w are equally expressed in the F1 generation (although this may not be true biologically), then each F1 offspring will have the genotype DWWw or DDww. Since the allele for violet flower color is dominant, all the offspring will have violet flowers.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
