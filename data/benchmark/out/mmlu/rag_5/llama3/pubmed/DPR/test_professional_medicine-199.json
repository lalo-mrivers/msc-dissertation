["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms are described as a worsening tremor of her hands that has been present most of her life. The tremor used to be mild and occur only when she was tired or stressed, but it has become more noticeable and frequent over the past month. She is taking fluoxetine for bereavement, and her drinking habits have changed since her husband's death. Given this information, the worsening tremor could be related to a medication effect, an underlying medical condition, or a psychological factor. The patient's history of essential hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and moderate tremor suggest that she may have a pre-existing neurological condition. However, there is no mention of any other symptoms that would suggest a Parkinsonian syndrome.
