["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To solve this problem, we need to first convert the athlete's steady-rate oxygen uptake from liters per minute (L/min) to milliliters per second (mL/s). We can use the conversion factor: 1 L = 1000 mL. So, 3.0 L/min is equivalent to 3000 mL/min. To convert this to mL/s, we divide by 60 seconds (since there are 60 seconds in a minute): 3000 mL/min ÷ 60 = 50 mL/s.\n\nNext, we need to calculate the total volume of oxygen consumed during the 5-minute exercise period. We can multiply the steady-rate oxygen uptake by the duration: 50 mL/s × 300 s (5 minutes) = 15,000 mL.\n\nFinally, we use the energy equivalent of oxygen (EEO) to convert the volume of oxygen consumed into kilojoules (kJ). The EEO is approximately 20.1 kJ/L. We can multiply the total volume of oxygen consumed by the EEO: 15,000 mL ÷ 1000 (to convert mL to L) × 20.1 kJ/L = 300 kJ.\n\nTherefore, the athlete's steady-rate oxygen uptake averages 3.0 L/min for 5 minutes of exercise expends approximately 300 kJ.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
