["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about David's personality traits, specifically his self-esteem, self-efficacy, and locus of control. We need to analyze the given information to determine which option best describes him.\n\nFrom the description, we know that David is a perfectionist who compares himself to better players and is hard on himself when he can't master a section of music. This suggests that he has high self-esteem (A) as he is critical towards his own performance. He also has strong self-efficacy (B) because he sets high standards for himself.\n\nInternal locus of control implies that David believes his successes or failures are due to his own efforts rather than external factors. Given the description, it seems that David's focus on his own performance and perceived shortcomings suggests an internal locus of control. Therefore, we can conclude that option B best describes David: High self-esteem, strong self-efficacy, internal locus of control.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
