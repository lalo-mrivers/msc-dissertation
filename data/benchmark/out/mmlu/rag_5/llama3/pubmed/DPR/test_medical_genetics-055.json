["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"This question is about the lac operon in E. coli. The repressor binds to lactose and prevents expression of the lac operon genes when glucose levels are low. If a mutation occurs that prevents the repressor from binding to lactose, then the repressor won't be able to prevent expression of the lac operon genes regardless of glucose levels. Therefore, the answer is A: constitutive expression of the lac operon genes.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
