["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, we need to identify the number of individuals who died from the specific type of cancer. We know that 100 individuals who received Drug X died, and 100 individuals who did not receive the drug also died. This means a total of 200 individuals died from this type of cancer. Next, we need to calculate the proportion of individuals who took Drug X among those who died from the specific type of cancer: 100/200 = 0.5 or 50%. Similarly, the proportion of individuals who did not take Drug X and died from the same type of cancer is also 50% (100/200). Now we can calculate the relative risk by dividing the proportion of individuals who took Drug X and died from this type of cancer by the proportion of individuals who did not take the drug and died from the same type of cancer. This gives us a ratio of 1:1 or 1.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
