["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"There are no relevant documents related to glycolysis or enzymes involved in the given texts. Therefore, we need to look at general knowledge about glycolysis. Glycolysis is a process that breaks down glucose into pyruvate. It involves several enzyme-catalyzed reactions. The rate-limiting step in glycolysis is typically phosphofructokinase.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
