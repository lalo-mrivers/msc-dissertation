["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has systemic sclerosis (scleroderma) and presents with progressive shortness of breath and nonproductive cough. Pulmonary function tests show total lung capacity is 80% of predicted and diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide, corrected for alveolar volume, is 65% of predicted. This suggests that the patient has interstitial lung disease. Histologically, this would be consistent with diffuse interstitial fibrosis.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
