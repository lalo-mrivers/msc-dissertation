["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about determining CMV DNA presence in the blood of a bone marrow transplant recipient. The laboratory procedure involves oligonucleotides specific for CMV DNA, thermostable DNA polymerase, and nucleotides. Repetitive cycles of heating and cooling are performed, and the reaction product is detected by gel electrophoresis. This suggests that the technician used a technique that amplifies the target DNA sequence, which rules out options A (Northern blotting), C (Reverse transcription) and D (Southern blotting). The remaining option, B (Polymerase chain reaction), fits the described procedure and is likely the correct choice.\", \"answer_choice\": B}"]
