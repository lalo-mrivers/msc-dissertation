["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Meiosis and mitosis are both types of cell division. Meiosis is the process by which sex cells (eggs and sperm) are formed, while mitosis is the process by which non-sex cells divide to produce more cells. The phases of meiosis include prophase I, metaphase I, anaphase I, telophase I, prophase II, metaphase II, anaphase II, and telophase II. Mitosis also has similar phases: prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase.\n\nThe question is asking about the common phases between meiosis and mitosis. Prophase and metaphase are shared between both processes, but G0 phase is not directly related to either meiosis or mitosis.\n\nG2 phase is a part of the cell cycle that precedes mitosis, but it's not a part of meiosis. S phase is when DNA replication occurs during the cell cycle, and while it's important for both meiosis and mitosis, it's not one of the specific phases being asked about.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should include II only, referring to the G2 phase.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B: I and II only\""]
