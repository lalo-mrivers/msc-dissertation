["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the acceleration of an object on an inclined plane with friction. We can start by considering the forces acting on the object: there's the force due to gravity (mg) and the normal force (N) perpendicular to the plane. The net force parallel to the plane is what determines the acceleration.\n\nSince the angle of incline is ?, we know that sin ? = opposite side / hypotenuse = N_x / N, where N_x is the component of the normal force parallel to the plane.\n\nThe force due to friction (f) opposes the motion, so the net force parallel to the plane is F_net = mg sin ? - f. Since acceleration is proportional to force and inversely proportional to mass, we can write a = F_net / m.\n\nUsing the formula for friction (f = µN_x), we substitute N_x = N * sin ?, which gives us a = g sin ? - µ*g*sin ?. Combining like terms, we get a = g * (sin ? - µ*sin ?).\",\n\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
