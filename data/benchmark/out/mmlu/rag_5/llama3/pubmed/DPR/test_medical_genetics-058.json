["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about exons, which are specific segments of DNA that are used to create a protein. We need to examine the provided documents to find relevant information about exons. The first document is about back injury prevention and has nothing to do with exons. The second document is about health education and nursing perspectives on health, also irrelevant. The third document discusses prostacyclin-thromboxane balance in patients with cerebrovascular disorders, but does not mention exons at all. The fourth and final document is about cyclin A and the retinoblastoma gene product complex with a common transcription factor. It contains relevant information about protein-coding genes, which include exons.\n\nAccording to this document, exons are specific parts of DNA that code for proteins. Some statements need to be analyzed:\n\nA: Some exons in protein-coding genes consist of noncoding DNA.\nThis statement is correct because not all exons contain coding regions. Some exons may be noncoding and serve other purposes.\n\nB: The first exon of a protein-coding gene always contains the translational start site.\nThis statement is incorrect because the translational start site can be located in any of the first few exons, but it's not necessarily the first one.\n\nC: The last exon of a protein-coding gene always contains the normal termination codon.\nThis statement is correct because the termination codon usually marks the end of a coding sequence and signals translation to stop. The last exon often contains this termination codon.\n\nD: A coding exon is always translated in just one of the three possible forward reading frames.\nThis statement is incorrect because a single exon can be translated in multiple reading frames, depending on its sequence.\"\n\n\"answer_choice\": \"A, C\""]
