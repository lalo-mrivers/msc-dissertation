["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking which adaptation would limit pollination by bees and promote hummingbird pollination. Bees are generally attracted to yellow or white flowers with long tubes for nectar collection. Hummingbirds, on the other hand, have a longer beak than bees and prefer red-colored flowers. The key adaptation that would promote hummingbird pollination is therefore red coloration of the flowers, which would attract these birds but not bees.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"]
