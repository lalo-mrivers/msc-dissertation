["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with normal female body habitus, breast development, and genitalia, but no pubic or axillary hair. The patient refuses a pelvic exam. This suggests that the issue is not related to the reproductive system itself, but rather the development of secondary sexual characteristics (pubic and axillary hair). Congenital adrenal hyperplasia can cause amenorrhea and lack of virilization, but it would also typically cause some degree of masculinization, which is not seen in this patient. Androgen insensitivity syndrome is a possible explanation as it causes resistance to androgens, resulting in the absence of pubic and axillary hair. Ectodermal dysplasia can cause hair loss, but it would not specifically affect pubic or axillary hair. A psychiatric disorder is unlikely given the patient's normal physical examination.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
