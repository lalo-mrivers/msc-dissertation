["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the inheritance of flower color. The F1 offspring have light blue flowers, which suggests that one or both parents are carrying a recessive gene for this trait. When the F1 progeny are selfed, a 1:2:1 ratio of dark blue to light blue to white flowers is observed, which indicates that there is a single gene controlling the flower color. The results suggest that the dominant allele (D) produces the dark blue or light blue colors, while the recessive allele (d) produces the white color. This fits with the codominance model, where both alleles contribute equally to the phenotype.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
