["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the characteristics of Type I muscle fibers. The documents provided are not directly related to muscle fibers, but we can look for information on muscles in the case report 'Unilateral headache with features of hemicrania continua and cervicogenic headache--a case report'. In this report, it mentions that a cervical cause is suggested, which implies that there might be some information about the muscles in the neck. The histological resemblance to a mature teratoma with three different germ-cell components, including cartilage, striated muscles, small salivary glands, and nerves can give us an idea about the type of muscle fibers present. We can infer that since it mentions striated muscles, Type I muscle fibers are likely to be involved.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
