["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Bernoulli's principle states that an increase in velocity results in a decrease in pressure. In a capillary network, the pressure is primarily determined by the pressure head (which increases with distance from the heart) and dynamic pressure (which remains relatively constant). Since the circulatory system does not perfectly obey Bernoulli's principle due to the presence of blood viscosity, we cannot directly compare the pressure in different parts of the body using this principle. However, we can make an educated estimate based on the general circulation patterns and hemodynamics. The neck is closer to the heart than the knee, so the pressure head would be higher in the neck compared to the knee. This suggests that the pressure in the neck would be greater than the pressure in the knee.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
