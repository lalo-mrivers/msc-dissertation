["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the physiological and biochemical strategies used by C4 and CAM plants to reduce photorespiration. The key is to identify how these two types of plants fix CO2 and carry out the Calvin cycle. None of the provided documents seem relevant, so we need to focus on the characteristics of C4 and CAM plants from general knowledge or other external sources. After researching, it appears that C4 plants have a specialized photosynthetic pathway that involves fixing CO2 in the mesophyll but carrying out the Calvin cycle in the bundle sheath. In contrast, CAM plants also fix CO2 in the mesophyll but carry out the Calvin cycle in the bundle sheath. Therefore, option B accurately compares the two strategies.\", \"answer_choice\": B}"]
