["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the products of ADP degradation that increase in concentration in blood during multiple sprint sports. A quick scan of the provided documents shows that they are related to health visits, population models, headaches, and osteochondromas, none of which seem relevant to this topic. Therefore, we need to look beyond these documents for information on ADP degradation. A search for relevant information reveals that ADP is broken down into inorganic phosphate and AMP.
