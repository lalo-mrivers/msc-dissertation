["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Desmosomes are specialized adhesion structures found between adjacent cells. There are two main types of desmosomes: spot desmosomes and belt desmosomes. Spot desmosomes are small, uniform structures that connect the plasma membrane to the intermediate filaments in each cell. Belt desmosomes, on the other hand, are larger and more complex, and they connect adjacent cells directly by forming a continuous band around the perimeter of each cell. Gap junctions are specialized channels that allow for direct communication between adjacent cells through the exchange of ions and small molecules. Tight junctions are impermeable barriers that prevent the passage of substances between adjacent cells. Given the description of the fluorescent molecule passing from one cell to another, it is most likely that the molecule passed through a gap junction.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
