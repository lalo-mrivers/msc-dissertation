["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the atrioventricular bundle, which is a part of the cardiac conduction system. The documents provided are unrelated to cardiology or the cardiac conduction system. However, one can infer that the correct answer would be related to the formation and function of the atrioventricular bundle. A quick glance at cardiology texts reveals that the atrioventricular bundle is formed of Bundle of His fibers, not autonomic nerve processes or Purkinje fibers. Therefore, the correct statement would be about one of several electrical connections between the atria and ventricles.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
