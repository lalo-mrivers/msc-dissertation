["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about reflexes. We need to consider which type of reflex is being referred to (plantar or ankle/knee). The plantar reflex is mentioned specifically, so we'll focus on that. A positive Babinski reflex is an extensor response, not a flexor one, according to the documents. Therefore, option A is incorrect. An extensor plantar response can indicate a lower motor neuron lesion, which aligns with option B. The root value of the ankle reflex is L4-S1, and for the knee reflex, it's L2-L4 (not L1). Thus, options C and D are not correct.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
