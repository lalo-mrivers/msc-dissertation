["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about Drosophila developmental defects caused by homeotic cluster gene mutations. The documents provided are unrelated to this topic. There is no relevant information in the papers about neuroleptic malignant syndrome, chronic granulomatous prostatitis, echographic features, eye-head coordination during orienting gaze shifts, situs inversus viscerum, or laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Therefore, we can only rely on general knowledge to answer this question. Homeotic cluster genes are a set of genes involved in developmental patterning and segmentation in Drosophila. Mutation of these genes often results in defects in segment formation and homeosis. Hence, the correct answer is...\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A: Absence of a group of contiguous segments\"\n}"]
