["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking which process uses the gradient of material to control the direction of movement across the cell membrane. Osmosis is a process where water molecules move from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration through a selectively permeable membrane, driven by the concentration gradient. This fits the description in the question as it only uses the gradient of material (water) to control the direction of movement. Therefore, the answer is A: Osmosis.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
