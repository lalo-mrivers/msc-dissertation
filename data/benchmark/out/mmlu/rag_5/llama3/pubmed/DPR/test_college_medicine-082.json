["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The dependent variables in this experiment are the outcome measures that are being measured or observed as a response to the independent variables. In this case, the experiment is manipulating several factors (compensation amount, learning time, and recall location) and measuring the effect on the subjects' ability to recall the facts. This suggests that the dependent variables are the number of facts the subjects can recall (III), which is being influenced by the independent variables.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
