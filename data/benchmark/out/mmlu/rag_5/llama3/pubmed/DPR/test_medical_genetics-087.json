["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the type of mutation that causes achondroplasia. Since achondroplasia is a genetic disorder characterized by dwarfism, we need to look for information related to bone growth and development. After reviewing the provided documents, I found that none of them specifically mention achondroplasia or its mutations. However, one of the documents mentions osteochondromas, which are benign tumors that can affect bone growth. Although this is not directly related to achondroplasia, it does give us some insight into bone-related genetic disorders. Based on this information, we can infer that the mutation causing achondroplasia is likely to have an effect on bone growth and development. This suggests that the mutation could be classified as a dominant negative or loss-of-function mutation.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
