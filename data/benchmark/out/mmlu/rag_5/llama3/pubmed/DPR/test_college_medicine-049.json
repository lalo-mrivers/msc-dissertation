["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of moles of ethane provided. The molar mass of ethane is 30 g/mol (14g/mol x 2 for carbon + 4g/mol x 4 for hydrogen). We are given 84g of ethane, so we can convert it to moles by dividing by the molar mass: 84g / 30g/mol = 2.8 mol.\n\nSince the reaction is C2H4 + O2 â†’ CO2 + H2O, each mole of ethane reacts with one mole of oxygen to produce one mole of carbon dioxide and water. So, we can multiply the number of moles of ethane by the ratio of carbon dioxide to ethane: 2.8 mol x (1 mol CO2 / 1 mol C2H4) = 2.8 mol CO2.\n\nFinally, we need to convert this result back to grams using the molar mass of carbon dioxide (44 g/mol): 2.8 mol x 44g/mol = 123.2g.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
