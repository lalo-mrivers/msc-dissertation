["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about factors that do NOT promote linkage disequilibrium. Linkage disequilibrium refers to the non-random association between alleles at two or more loci. Asexual reproduction is not a factor that promotes linkage disequilibrium, as it does not involve gene recombination. Coadapted gene complexes and epistasis both refer to interactions between genes, which can lead to non-random associations between alleles. Random mating refers to the random combination of alleles from parents during meiosis, which can also result in non-random associations. Therefore, Asexual reproduction is the correct answer.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
