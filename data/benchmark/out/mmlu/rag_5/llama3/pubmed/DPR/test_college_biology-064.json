["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"During the mammalian cardiac cycle, blood is transferred from the veins to the arteries. The venous side is more compliant, meaning it can expand more easily. This means that during diastole (when the heart is relaxing), the pressure in the veins drops. In contrast, the arterial side is less compliant, so during systole (when the heart is contracting), the pressure in the arteries increases.\n\nAs a result of this transfer, there would be an increase in venous pressure and a decrease in arterial pressure. This is because the blood is moving from an area of lower pressure (the veins) to an area of higher pressure (the arteries).\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the pressures within each compartment are not directly equivalent. The venous pressure increases during systole, but it doesn't increase as much as the arterial pressure decreases.\n\nTherefore, option C is the correct answer: 'an increase in venous pressure and an equal but opposite decrease in arterial pressure'.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
