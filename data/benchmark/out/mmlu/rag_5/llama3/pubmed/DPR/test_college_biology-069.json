["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about a species of goose that nests on both cliffs and beaches near the ocean. Chicks from cliff nests must tumble down the cliff to get to the ocean, and many are killed by the fall. This suggests that there might be some evolutionary advantage or adaptive reason for geese to nest on cliffs. The options provided seem to relate to the fitness of geese nesting on cliffs versus beaches. Based on this, I think the question is asking which option best explains why cliff nesting might be beneficial for the goose species.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B: Cliff-side nesting confers a higher fitness than does beach nesting.\""]
