["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the targeting of a newly synthesized protein. The answer should be related to signal peptides and their roles in directing proteins to specific destinations. Based on the information provided, it can be inferred that the destination is not plasma membrane (as there are no signal peptides for this destination), lysosome (as this would require only one signal peptide), or cytosol (as this would not require any signal peptides). Considering the options, chloroplast is a organelle found in plant cells and requires two different signal peptides for targeting. Therefore, the answer is D: Chloroplast.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
