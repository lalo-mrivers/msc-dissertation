["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to consider the structure and function of a sarcomere, which is the functional unit of striated muscle. We know that tropomyosin and troponin are proteins that play important roles in regulating muscle contraction. Tropomyosin binds to actin filaments and blocks myosin's binding site, preventing contraction in the relaxed state. Troponin is a calcium-binding protein that helps regulate muscle contraction. The thick filament is composed of myosin and tropomyosin, while the thin filament is composed of actin and troponin.\n\nDuring contraction, H zones do not become elongated. Instead, the thick filaments slide along the thin filaments, allowing for muscle contraction. Each myosin helical tail does contain an actin-binding site and an ATP-hydrolyzing site, which are important for muscle contraction.\n\nThe proteins troponin and tropomyosin are part of the thin filament, not the thick filament. Therefore, option D is incorrect.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
