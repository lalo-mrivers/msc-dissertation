["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents don't mention anything about the intake of carbohydrate in the diet and its effects on exercise performance. However, one document talks about glycogen levels in rat ova during cleavage, which is a different context. Another document discusses pH levels in the rat epididymis, but this doesn't seem directly related to the question either. The remaining documents don't provide any information relevant to this topic.\n\nThe only clue comes from the document on 'Glycogen levels of rat ova during cleavage', which states that glycogen amounts in these eggs were found relatively constant during cleavage. This could imply that the body has a certain level of glycogen reserve, but it doesn't provide any information about how this affects exercise performance.\n\nThe only possible connection to the question is from the document on 'Measurement of pH in the rat epididymis in vivo', which mentions acidification of fluid leaving the testis. This could potentially be related to muscle pH levels during exercise, but it's a long shot.\n\nOverall, the most plausible answer seems to be C: may impair high intensity exercise performance.\", \n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
