["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The provided documents do not mention kinase reactions directly. However, we can analyze the information about stem cell factor (SCF) purification from Escherichia coli and Chinese hamster ovary cells. The paper describes the structural characterization of soluble forms of recombinant human SCF purified from these sources. Fluorescence emission spectra indicate that the single Trp residue is present in a hydrophobic environment. Circular dichroism and infrared spectroscopy indicate considerable secondary structure, including both alpha-helix and beta-sheet. Molecular weight determinations by sedimentation equilibrium show that the molecules are dimeric (noncovalently associated), and gel filtration analyses are consistent with this conclusion.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
