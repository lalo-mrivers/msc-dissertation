["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 29-year-old woman who has had increasingly severe lower abdominal pain and nausea for the past 2 days.

The physical examination findings of abdominal tenderness in the lower quadrants bilaterally with rebound and guarding suggest a possible intra-abdominal process.
