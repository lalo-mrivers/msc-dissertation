["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The given question is about gas volume at different pressures. The initial condition is 0.1L at 200atm. To find the volume at 1atm, we need to consider Boyle's Law: PV = constant. As pressure decreases (from 200atm to 1atm), volume will increase proportionally. So, we can set up a ratio of volumes and pressures: 0.1L * 200atm / xL * 1atm = 20L\", \"answer_choice\": B}"]
