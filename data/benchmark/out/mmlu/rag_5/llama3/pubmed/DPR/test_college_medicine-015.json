["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for the absolute threshold for hearing the decibels produced by the bell. This means we need to find the power level at which the mice start to respond (press the lever). Looking at the data, we can see that at 80% power, 20 mice responded, at 70%, 15 responded, and at 60%, 10 responded. The power level with the lowest response is 60%. This suggests that any lower power levels would not be detected by the mice, making it the absolute threshold.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
