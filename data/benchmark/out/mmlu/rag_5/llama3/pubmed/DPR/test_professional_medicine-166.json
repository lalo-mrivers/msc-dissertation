["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with a painless swelling in the left testicle that has varied in size over several months. The lesion transilluminates well, and there are no inguinal nodes palpable. A testicular scan is normal. Based on this information, it's likely that the swelling is not a torsion or abscess, as those would typically present with severe pain or erythema. The patient also does not have any history of trauma, which reduces the likelihood of a traumatic etiology. With a normal testicular scan, the differential diagnosis includes a benign cystic lesion or an early stage of testicular cancer. In this case, the most appropriate management would be to rule out testicular cancer with a needle biopsy.\", \"answer_choice\": C}"]
