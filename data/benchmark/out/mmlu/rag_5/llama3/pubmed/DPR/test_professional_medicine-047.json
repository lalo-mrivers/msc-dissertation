["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to consider the Starling forces that affect glomerular filtration. The primary forces involved are hydrostatic pressure (P) and oncotic pressure (Ï€). The filtration coefficient (Kf) is a measure of the ability of the glomerulus to filter plasma.\n\nWhen the efferent arteriole is constricted with a vascular clamp, it increases the resistance in the system, which would increase the hydrostatic pressure within the glomerulus. This would lead to an increase in the Starling forces favoring filtration, which means that more fluid would be filtered out of the bloodstream and into the urinary space.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D: Increased hydrostatic pressure.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
