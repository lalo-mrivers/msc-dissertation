["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking how many fragments a restriction enzyme would be expected to cleave the bacteriophage DNA into. To answer this, we need to consider the size of the genome (5,000 bp) and the recognition sequence of the restriction enzyme (4 base pairs). The key point here is that the recognition sequence is 4 base pairs long, which means the restriction enzyme will cleave every occurrence of this sequence in the DNA. Since the genome size is 5,000 bp, we can divide it by the length of the recognition sequence to get an estimate of how many times the enzyme would need to bind and cleave to cut the DNA into fragments. This calculation gives us a rough estimate of about 20.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
