She has no significant medical history, takes no medications, and does not smoke. Her sister has asthma, which suggests that there might be an underlying genetic predisposition to respiratory conditions. The patient's symptoms are consistent with exercise-induced bronchospasm or exercise-induced asthma. The spirometry results show an FEV1:FVC ratio of 90% and an FEV1 of 90% of predicted, which is within normal limits.
