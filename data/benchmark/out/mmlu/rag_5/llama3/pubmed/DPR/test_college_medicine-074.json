["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Since MERRF is an extremely rare disorder that affects neuromuscular systems due to a mutation in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), we can consider the inheritance pattern of this condition. Mitochondrial DNA is inherited exclusively through the maternal line, meaning that only females can pass on the mutated mtDNA to their offspring. Therefore, when an affected male and a normal female reproduce, all offspring will inherit some amount of mutated mtDNA from the mother. As a result, we would expect the offspring to be affected in some way. However, the severity of the symptoms may vary depending on the percentage of mutated mtDNA inherited.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
