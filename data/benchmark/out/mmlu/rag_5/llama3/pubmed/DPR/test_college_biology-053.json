["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks what experimental observations would be expected to block in vitro fertilization. Mouse sperm bind to ZP3 receptors in the zona pellucida of mouse eggs. Injecting eggs with antibodies that bind to ZP3 or incubating eggs with antibodies that bind to ZP3 would both prevent binding and thus block in vitro fertilization. Incubating sperm with purified ZP3 prior to mixing sperm and eggs would also block in vitro fertilization by preventing the acrosomal reaction from occurring. Coating synthetic beads with a different glycoprotein, ZP2, fails to lead to sperm aggregation on the beads because it does not contain the specific receptor-binding protein (ZP3) required for the acrosomal reaction. Therefore, all of these experimental observations would be expected except one.\", \"answer_choice\": C}"]
