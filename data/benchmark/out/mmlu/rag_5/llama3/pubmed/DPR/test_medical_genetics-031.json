["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the genotype frequency of heterozygotes, we need to understand Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium principles. Since the frequency of the two alleles is 0.6 and 0.4, we can calculate the frequency of homozygous dominant (aa) as 0.36 (0.6 x 0.6), homozygous recessive (bb) as 0.16 (0.4 x 0.4), and heterozygotes (ab) as 0.48 (2 x 0.6 x 0.4). Therefore, the genotype frequency of heterozygotes is 0.48.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
