["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the pupillary light reflex. The relevant documents are not directly related to this topic. However, we can rule out options that are clearly incorrect based on our general knowledge of the pupillary light reflex. For example, option B is incorrect because the superior colliculi in the midbrain mediate the pupillary light reflex, not the inferior colliculi. Option D is also incorrect because the afferent limb of the pupillary light reflex is carried by the optic nerve, not the oculomotor nerve. We are left with options A and C.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"]
