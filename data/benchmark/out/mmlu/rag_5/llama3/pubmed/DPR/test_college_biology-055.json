["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The experiment involves manipulating the first cleavage plane of an amphibian zygote, which means that one blastomere will contain the gray crescent. The gray crescent is a structure that plays a crucial role in embryonic development and contains the germ plasm of the embryo. It is known to contain most of the genetic material necessary for the formation of all cell types in the embryo. As such, it can be inferred that the blastomere containing the gray crescent will have a higher probability of forming a complete, but possibly smaller, embryo.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
