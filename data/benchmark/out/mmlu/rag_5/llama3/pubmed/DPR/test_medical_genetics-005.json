["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about mapping human chromosomes. None of the provided documents are directly related to chromosome mapping or genetics. However, I will carefully review each document to see if there is any information that could be indirectly relevant. Document A discusses stress and schizophrenia, which is not related to chromosome mapping. Document B talks about organ transplantation, which also has no direct connection to chromosome mapping. Document C describes a surgical technique for removing cataracts, and it does not contain any information about chromosomes or genetics. Document D discusses the role of health visitors in campaigning for change, which is unrelated to chromosome mapping as well. Given that none of these documents provide any relevant information, I will have to rely on my general knowledge of human genetics to answer this question. According to my understanding, humans have 23 pairs of chromosomes, and the number of linkage groups is equal to the number of chromosomes. Therefore, mapping of human chromosomes has determined that the number of linkage groups is indeed equal to the number of chromosomes.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
