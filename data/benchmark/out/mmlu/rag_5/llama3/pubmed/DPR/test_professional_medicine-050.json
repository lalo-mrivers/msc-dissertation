["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is experiencing atrial fibrillation with a rapid heart rate. Given that the initial treatment with metoprolol was effective in slowing down the pulse to 90/min, but then the pulse increased again to 160/min, it seems that the metoprolol is having a temporary effect. Considering the patient's medical history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and the current symptoms, it appears that the treatment should focus on stabilizing the heart rate and rhythm. Digoxin is an option for treating atrial fibrillation, especially in cases where beta blockers like metoprolol have a temporary effect. Enalapril is not relevant to this patient's condition. Lidocaine can be used for ventricular arrhythmias but does not seem to be the best choice here.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
