["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"After reviewing the provided documents, none of them discuss prosthetic groups or enzymes. Therefore, it's unlikely that this information is relevant to the provided question. However, I will still analyze the available medical literature and consider the potential options.\\n\\nOption A: Enzymes require specific conditions such as temperature, pH, and substrate concentrations to function optimally. Prosthetic groups are not universally required by all enzymes in the cell. Option B is also incorrect because prosthetic groups are covalently attached to enzymes, unlike hydrogen bonds which are weak interactions.\\n\\nOption C: Allosteric modification of enzyme activity refers to the binding of a molecule or ion that causes a conformational change and alters the enzyme's substrate specificity or rate of reaction. Prosthetic groups can participate in allosteric modifications but this is not their sole function.\\n\\nOption D: This statement best describes prosthetic groups. They are tightly bound to enzymes through covalent bonds, such as thiol linkages, and are essential for the enzyme's activity.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
