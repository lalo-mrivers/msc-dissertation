["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about muscle lactate production. The relevant documents are about phosphate transport in rat liver mitochondria, metal ion catalyzed oxidation of the antibiotic rifampicin, acute bacterial meningitis in childhood, and comparative effect of calcium and adrenergic system on calcitonin secretion in man. None of these topics directly relate to muscle lactate production. However, we have a document about differential effects of methylphenidate and d-amphetamine on stereotyped behavior in the rat. This document mentions glucose breakdown and glycolysis. Glycolysis is the process by which glucose is broken down into pyruvate. Pyruvate can then be converted to lactate in the absence of oxygen, a process known as anaerobic glycolysis. Therefore, we can infer that muscle lactate production increases when...\", \"answer_choice\": \"D: glycolysis is activated at the onset of exercise.\"}"]
