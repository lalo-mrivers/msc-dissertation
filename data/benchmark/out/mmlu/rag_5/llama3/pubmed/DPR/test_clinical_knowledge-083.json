["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for the dose of dopamine in milligrams that a person will receive in an hour. The rate of administration is 4 micrograms/kg/min. To find the total dose in an hour, we need to multiply the rate by the weight of the person and then convert micrograms to milligrams.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the rate from micrograms per kilogram per minute to micrograms per hour. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:\n\n4 micrograms/kg/min × 65 kg = 260 micrograms/hr\n\nNext, we need to convert micrograms to milligrams. There are 1000 micrograms in a milligram, so:\n\n260 micrograms ÷ 1000 = 0.26 milligrams\n\nFinally, since the question asks for the dose in an hour, we can multiply the dose per hour by 1 to get the answer:\n\n0.26 milligrams × 1 = 0.26 milligrams\",\n\n\"answer_choice\": \"C: 0.26\""]
