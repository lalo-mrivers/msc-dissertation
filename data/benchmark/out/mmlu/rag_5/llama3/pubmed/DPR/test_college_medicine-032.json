["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The problem is about sound waves emitted by a source. The properties of the sound wave that change when it exits one medium and enters a denser medium are velocity, intensity, frequency, and wavelength. Based on physical principles, we know that when a sound wave enters a denser medium, its velocity decreases (since speed increases with decreasing density), but its frequency remains unchanged. The intensity and wavelength might also change due to absorption or refraction in the new medium. Therefore, the correct answer is the property that remains constant: frequency.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"]
