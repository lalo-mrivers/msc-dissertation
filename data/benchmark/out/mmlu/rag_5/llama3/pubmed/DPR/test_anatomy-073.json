["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"When examining a patient with an unfavourable fracture of the body of the mandible, we need to consider the muscles that attach to this bone. The digastric muscle attaches anteriorly and inferiorly, the lateral pterygoid muscle attaches posterolaterally, the medial pterygoid muscle attaches posteromedially, and the temporalis muscle attaches superiorly and posteriorly. Considering these attachments, we can deduce that an unfavourable fracture of the body of the mandible would not be displaced downwards by the action of the digastric muscle as it is already attached inferiorly. Similarly, it would not be displaced anteriorly by the lateral pterygoid muscle nor medially by the medial pterygoid muscle as these muscles do not attach to the superior or posterior aspects of the mandible. Therefore, we are left with the temporalis muscle which attaches superiorly and posteriorly, suggesting that the anterior fragment would be displaced backwards.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
