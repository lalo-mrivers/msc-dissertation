["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The frequency of affected males is 0.10 (one in ten). Since this is an X-linked recessive condition, the females will be carriers if they inherit the X chromosome with the mutated gene. The frequency of carrier females will be 2*0.10 = 0.20 since each female has two X chromosomes and one can be a carrier. However, only half of the carrier females (0.20) will express the condition as affected females. Therefore, the expected frequency of affected females is 0.20/2 = 0.10.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
