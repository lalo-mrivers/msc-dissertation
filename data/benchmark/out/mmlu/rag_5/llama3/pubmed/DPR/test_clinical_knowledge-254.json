["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant document is [Effect of various plasma expanders on blood group serological study results]. This study highlights that plasma expanders can disturb serological blood typing tests to varying amounts. It does not mention anything about measuring blood pressure in an arm above the level of the heart. However, it is mentioned in other studies that this position can cause a false reading in blood pressure measurement due to the gravitational effect on blood flow. Therefore, it can be inferred that measuring blood pressure in an arm above the level of the heart will underestimate the blood pressure.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
