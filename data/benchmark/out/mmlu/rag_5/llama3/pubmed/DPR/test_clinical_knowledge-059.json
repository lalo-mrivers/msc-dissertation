["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The chain of survival is a well-known medical concept that outlines the steps to be taken in case of cardiac arrest. The question asks us to put four links in the correct order. To start with, we need to recognize and call for help early (link 3). This is because prompt recognition and response are crucial in cardiac emergencies. Next, we need to perform early CPR (link 2) to keep the victim's blood circulating and brain functioning until defibrillation can be done. Early defibrillation (link 1) is then performed to restore a normal heartbeat. Finally, post-resuscitation care (link 4) is provided to ensure the patient receives the necessary medical attention after cardiac arrest.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
