["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks for the total dose of the drug in grams. The person weighs 62 kg and their drug dose is 15 mg/kg. To find the total dose, we need to multiply the weight by the dose. Since there are 1000 milligrams (mg) in one gram, we can convert the dose from mg to grams as follows: 15 mg = 0.015 g (since 1 g = 1000 mg). Then we multiply the weight in kg by this dose in grams: 62 kg * 0.015 g/kg = ?\". \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
