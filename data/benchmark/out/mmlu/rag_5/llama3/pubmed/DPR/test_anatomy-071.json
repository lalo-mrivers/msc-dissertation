["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, I looked for keywords related to nerve impulses, muscles, or neurotransmitters. In [Spontaneous subcapsular hematoma of the kidney], there is no mention of substances that aid transmission of nerve impulses to muscles. In [Organs for transplantation], there are discussions about organ donation and transplantation, but not relevant to this question. [Campaigning for change] talks about health visitor roles and campaigning, which is also not related to the topic. [Spontaneous spinal subdural hematoma: case report and review of the literature] does not provide information on substances involved in nerve impulse transmission either. [How infection control procedures are affecting dental practice today] mentions OSHA regulations, but there's no relevant information about neurotransmitters or muscle function. Given this analysis, I'm left with no documents providing a clear answer. However, based on general knowledge of neuroscience and physiology, Acetylcholine is known to play a role in transmitting nerve impulses to muscles. Therefore, I will choose an answer based on available evidence.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
