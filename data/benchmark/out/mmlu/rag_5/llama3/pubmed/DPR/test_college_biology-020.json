["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Enzymes are biological molecules that facilitate chemical reactions by lowering the activation energy required for a reaction to occur. This is supported by the fact that enzymes bind specifically to substrates and position them in a way that facilitates the conversion of reactants to products. By lowering the activation energy, enzymes increase the rate of the reaction without altering the equilibrium constant or temperature.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
