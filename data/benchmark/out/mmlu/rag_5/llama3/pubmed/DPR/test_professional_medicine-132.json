["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about a 7-month-old infant with persistent watery diarrhea after being discharged from the hospital for an episode of enteritis and dehydration. The physical examination shows dry mucous membranes, slightly distended abdomen, and no other abnormalities. Given these symptoms, the problem is likely related to a common cause of diarrhea in infants. Fructose intolerance can cause diarrhea, but it's not the most likely cause considering the infant's age and the fact that he's on cow-milk formula. Transient lactase deficiency is another possibility, as it's a common condition in infants who are transitioning from breast milk or formula to solid foods. Magnesium deficiency is less likely as it would typically present with more severe symptoms than just diarrhea. Regional enteritis is an unlikely cause considering the infant's age and the fact that he's not showing any other signs of inflammatory bowel disease.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
