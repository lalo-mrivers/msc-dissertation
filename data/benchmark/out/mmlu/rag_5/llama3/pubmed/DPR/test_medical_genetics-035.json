["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The provided documents do not discuss genetic disorders such as alkaptonuria and albinism. Therefore, we must look outside these texts for information on the explanation of genetic disorders. Genetics is the study of heredity in living organisms, including the transmission of traits or characteristics from parents to offspring. The term 'inherited' refers to the passing down of a characteristic or trait from one's parents. Genetic disorders are caused by changes or mutations in an individual's DNA. This can result in the development of diseases or conditions that may be passed on to subsequent generations.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlkaptonuria and albinism are both genetic disorders caused by recessive inheritance, where a person must inherit two copies of a recessive gene (one from each parent) to express the disorder.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
