["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking why proteins are treated with a detergent (SDS) before being run through the electrophoresis gel. The answer lies in understanding the purpose of SDS-PAGE. It's an electrophoretic separation technique used to separate proteins based on their size and charge. The primary function of SDS is to denature the proteins, breaking the intramolecular bonds holding the tertiary and primary structure together. This creates linear fragments that can be separated based on size by molecular weight.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
