["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Understanding the concept of inhibition types. Noncompetitive inhibition occurs when an allosteric site on the enzyme is bound to by an inhibitor, preventing catalysis. Uncompetitive inhibition occurs when an inhibitor binds to the enzyme-substrate complex, also preventing catalysis. Increasing substrate concentration would not affect noncompetitive inhibitors since they bind to the enzyme and not the substrate. For uncompetitive inhibitors, increasing substrate concentration would lead to a greater amount of substrate binding to the enzyme, making it more difficult for the inhibitor to bind. This would effectively decrease the impact of the uncompetitive inhibitor. Noncompetitive inhibition is independent of substrate concentration.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B: Decreasing impact of uncompetitive inhibitor and increasing impact of noncompetitive inhibitor.\""]
