["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the postnatal growth of the maxilla. I will look for information that relates to this topic in the provided documents. None of the given case reports or research papers provide relevant information on the postnatal growth of the maxilla. Since there are no relevant documents, I will focus on the other options and see if any of them seem plausible.\n\nOption A: Pneumatisation by enlargement of the developing maxillary sinus ceases at puberty seems possible, as it is a normal process that occurs during childhood and adolescence.\n\nOption B: Space is created for the eruption of the permanent molars by resorption of the maxillary tuberosity does not seem to be relevant to the postnatal growth of the maxilla. This option is more related to tooth development than bone growth.\n\nOption C: The zygomaticomaxillary sutures contribute to increase in height and length of the maxilla seems plausible, as these sutures are involved in facial development.\n\nOption D: The intermaxillary suture closes about eight years postnatally does not seem relevant to the postnatal growth of the maxilla. This option is more related to dental development than bone growth.\n\nBased on this analysis, I think options A and C are the most plausible answers.\", \n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
