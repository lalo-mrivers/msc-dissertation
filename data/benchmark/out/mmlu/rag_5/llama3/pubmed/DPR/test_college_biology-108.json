["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the physiological strategy that marine birds use to maintain their internal osmolarity at a constant level. Since seawater has a high osmotic pressure, the birds must have some mechanism to counteract this and maintain their tissue osmolarity. The relevant documents do not mention marine birds or osmolarities, but they do discuss various medical conditions and treatments. Therefore, we need to rely on general knowledge of physiology and the given options to answer this question.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
