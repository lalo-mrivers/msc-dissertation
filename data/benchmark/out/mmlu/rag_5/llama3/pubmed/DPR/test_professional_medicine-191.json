["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the sympathetic innervation for the viscera involved in this patient's condition. The viscera affected are likely related to the gastrointestinal system, which includes the stomach, small intestine, and large intestine. The sympathetic nervous system has ganglia located at various levels of the spinal cord. Since the symptoms presented by the patient include constipation and alternating loose stools, it is likely that the visceral afferent fibers from the intestines are being affected. Therefore, we need to determine where these fibers originate from.\n\nThe T11-L2 region is responsible for innervating the abdominal viscera, including the small intestine and large intestine. This region is also known as the 'thoraco-lumbar' or 'T12-L1' level.\n\nThe other options do not directly relate to the visceral afferent fibers from the intestines.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
