["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to consider the relationship between oxygen consumption and energy expenditure. The mean rate of oxygen consumption is given as 2 l/min for a male athlete during a training session. Energy expenditure is proportional to oxygen consumption, with a typical value of approximately 5 kJ/l. Therefore, we can calculate the rate of energy expenditure by multiplying the oxygen consumption rate by this proportionality constant. This gives us: rate of energy expenditure = 2 l/min x 5 kJ/l â‰ˆ 10 kJ/min. As the question asks for the approximate rate of energy expenditure in kJ/min, we can round this value to get approximately 10 kJ/min. To convert this to other units (e.g., J/s), we would need more information about the duration and intensity of the training session.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
