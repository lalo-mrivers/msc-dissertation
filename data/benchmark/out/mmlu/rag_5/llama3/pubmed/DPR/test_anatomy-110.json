["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The infraorbital nerve block affects the distribution of the maxillary division of the trigeminal nerve. The maxillary division has three branches: the middle nasal nerve, the anterior superior alveolar nerve, and the infraorbital nerve. The infraorbital nerve supplies sensation to the lower eyelid, cheek, and upper lip, as well as the labial gingiva of the upper teeth. Therefore, a successful infraorbital nerve block would produce anesthesia of the maxillary anterior teeth, their labial gingivae, the upper lip, and possibly the anterior hard palate.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
