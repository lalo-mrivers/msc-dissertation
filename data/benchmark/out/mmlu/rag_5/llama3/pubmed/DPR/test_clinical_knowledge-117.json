["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about an intracellular buffer that can limit pH changes when the rate of glycolysis is high. Glycolysis is a metabolic process that produces lactic acid as a byproduct. Elevated levels of lactic acid can lead to decreased pH, so we need a buffer that can help maintain normal pH levels. Among the options, carnosine is a known intracellular buffer that can neutralize excess hydrogen ions.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
