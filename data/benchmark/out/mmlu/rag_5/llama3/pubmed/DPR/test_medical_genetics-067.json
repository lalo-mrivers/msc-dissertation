["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about disorders that do not show X-linked inheritance. I will review the given documents to find information related to genetics and inheritance patterns. From the 'Periodontal aspects of hereditary epidermolysis bullosa' document, I know that hereditary epidermolysis bullosa is an autosomal dominant condition. The 'Juvenile dermatomyositis' document does not provide any specific information about inheritance pattern. The 'Health care costs and financing in world perspective' and 'Transesophageal echocardiography for insertion of a physiological pacemaker in early pregnancy' documents do not contain relevant information about genetics or inheritance patterns. On the other hand, I can recall from my general knowledge that Duchenne muscular dystrophy is an X-linked recessive condition, Tay-Sachs disease is an autosomal recessive condition, Haemophilia A and B are both inherited in an X-linked recessive pattern. Therefore, I will look for disorders among the given choices that do not show X-linked inheritance.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
