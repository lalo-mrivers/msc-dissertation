["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks which option is more plausible in Finland than elsewhere. To answer this, I will analyze the provided information about sauna use in Finland. According to the KIHD Study, men who used the sauna two to three times per week were 27% less likely to die from cardiovascular-related causes than men who didn't use the sauna. This finding suggests that sauna use is a common practice in Finland, which aligns with the country's high incidence of sauna use mentioned earlier. Considering this information, I will evaluate each option: A refers to skiing medals, B mentions a 86-year old mayor, C describes pets in households, and D discusses marriage satisfaction rates. While these options might be plausible in other contexts, they are not directly related to sauna use or Finnish culture. Therefore, the more plausible answer is an increased rate of pets in the household.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
