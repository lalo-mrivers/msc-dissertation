["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about SARMs (Selective Androgen Receptor Modulators). The documents provided are unrelated to SARMs. However, we can use the information about beta blockers and their effects on lymphocyte cultures to make an educated guess. Beta blockers were shown to enhance antigen-induced responses in human lymphocyte cultures by blocking the lymphocyte beta receptor. This suggests that some agents can modulate the effects of natural steroid hormones. Since SARMs are a type of androgen receptor modulator, we can infer that they may act similarly to beta blockers, mimicking the effects of natural steroid hormones.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
