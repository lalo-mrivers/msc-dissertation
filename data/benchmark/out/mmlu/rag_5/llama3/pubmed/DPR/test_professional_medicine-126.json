["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is experiencing episodes of fainting and fatigue. He had a previous myocardial infarction 12 years ago. The physical examination shows evidence of cannon A waves. The ECG shows a P-wave rate of 90/min, and an R-wave rate of 40/min, with no apparent relation between the two.
