["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"There is no relevant information provided about δβ-thalassaemia or its mutational mechanism in the given documents. The documents discuss various medical topics such as immunological mechanisms for tumor prevention, leucocyte migration inhibition test, immune therapy, plasma expanders, and adrenergic agonists and blockers on antigen-induced DNA synthesis. None of these topics are related to δβ-thalassaemia. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the mutational mechanism in δβ-thalassaemia based on the given information.\", \"answer_choice\": \"None of the above\"}"]
