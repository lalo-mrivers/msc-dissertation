["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To solve this problem, we need to first find the acceleration required for the car to reach a velocity of 130 km/h. Since the distance of the track is 50m, we can use the equation of motion: v = u + at, where v is the final velocity (130 km/h), u is the initial velocity (0 km/h), a is the acceleration and t is time. We know that the car will accelerate for a certain time to reach the desired velocity. Let's call this time t. Since the distance of the track is 50m, we can set up the equation: 130 = 0 + at. Now we need to find the value of a (acceleration) and then calculate the required acceleration rate.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
