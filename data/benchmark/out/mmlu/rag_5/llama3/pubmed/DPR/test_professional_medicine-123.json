["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is described as having a 'blank stare' and flat facial expression at the party, followed by catatonia and rigidity. This is consistent with PCP intoxication, which can cause a range of symptoms including altered mental status, agitated behavior, and muscle stiffness. Additionally, the patient's hostile behavior during the examination is also consistent with PCP intoxication. PCP is known to cause agitation, aggression, and a sense of 'blankness' in some users. In contrast, diazepam is an anticonvulsant and sedative that would not typically cause catatonia or aggressive behavior. Methamphetamine can cause a range of symptoms including euphoria, hyperactivity, and agitation, but the flat facial expression and rigidity are not typical features.
