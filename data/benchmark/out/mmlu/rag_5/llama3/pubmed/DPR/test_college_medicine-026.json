["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The problem is about the frequency of a gunshot recorded by a camera on a platform moving at 72 km/h. The speed of sound remains constant, unaffected by the motion of the platform. Since the frequency of the gunshot is normally 800 Hz and it's being recorded from a distance of 200 meters, we need to apply the Doppler effect. The relative velocity between the platform and the source of the sound (the actor in the car) is 108 km/h - 72 km/h = 36 km/h. This relative velocity causes an increase in frequency due to the Doppler effect. The perceived frequency can be calculated using the equation: f' = f * âˆš((v + v0) / (v - v0)), where f is the original frequency, f' is the perceived frequency, v is the velocity of the platform, and v0 is the velocity of the source. Plugging in the values, we get: f' = 800 * sqrt((72 + 108) / (72 - 108)) = 941 Hz.\", \"answer_choice\": A}"]
