["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the formation of hydrogen ions. Phosphocreatine breakdown occurs when muscles are used to generate energy and phosphates are released as a byproduct. Pyruvate is converted to lactate during anaerobic respiration, which also involves the release of hydrogen ions. Glycogen becomes depleted when it is broken down for energy. However, glycolysis, or the breakdown of glucose into pyruvate, does not necessarily involve the direct formation of hydrogen ions. Therefore, based on the information provided in the relevant documents, phosphocreatine breakdown occurs and pyruvate is converted to lactate as major mechanisms of resynthesising ATP.\", \"answer_choice\": B}"]
