["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the presence of two or more cell lines from different zygotes in a single individual. The relevant documents are unrelated to this topic, so we need to rely on general knowledge of genetics. Mosaicism refers to the mixture of different cell types within an individual, but it typically occurs when there is a mutation during embryonic development. Diploidy refers to the normal state of having two sets of chromosomes, which is not relevant to the question. Aneuploidy refers to an abnormal number of chromosomes, which is also not relevant. Chimaerism, on the other hand, refers to the presence of cells from different individuals or zygotes within a single individual, which matches the description in the question.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
