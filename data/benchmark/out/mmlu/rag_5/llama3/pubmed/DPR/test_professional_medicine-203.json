["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 14-year-old girl with a 2-day history of fever and pain and swelling of the right knee. She has no history of rash or joint pain, but her sister has inflammatory bowel disease. The patient's temperature is 39°C (102.2°F), blood pressure is 110/80 mm Hg, pulse is 95/min, and respirations are 20/min. Examination of the right knee shows swelling, tenderness, warmth, and erythema; range of motion is limited.\\r\\n\\r\\nGiven the sudden onset of symptoms, fever, and joint pain with swelling, I would suspect a possible inflammatory condition or reactive arthritis. The patient's history of soccer injury and her sister's inflammatory bowel disease suggest that Reiter's syndrome should be considered as a possibility. Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management is to perform arthrocentesis (D) to rule out septic arthritis and/or crystalline arthritis.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
