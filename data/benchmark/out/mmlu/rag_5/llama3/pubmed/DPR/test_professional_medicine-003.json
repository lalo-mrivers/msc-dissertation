["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has a grade 3/6 systolic murmur audible along the left sternal border at the third and fourth intercostal spaces. The cardiac examination also discloses weak femoral pulses and a radiofemoral delay. This suggests that the murmur is related to congenital heart disease, possibly hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Given the mild cardiomegaly with left ventricular prominence on chest xray and left ventricular hypertrophy on ECG, it's likely that the patient has hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM). HOCM is a common complication in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Therefore, the patient is at greatest risk for atrial fibrillation.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
