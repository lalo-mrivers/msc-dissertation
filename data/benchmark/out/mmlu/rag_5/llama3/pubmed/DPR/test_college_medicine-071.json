["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the period of time when maximal dynamic exercise becomes predominantly aerobic. The relevant documents don't provide information on this specific topic. Since there are no relevant extracts or references to physical activity or physiology in the provided documents, I cannot find any direct answers. However, I can try to eliminate options based on general knowledge and common understanding.\n\nThe first two options (10 seconds and 30 seconds) seem too short for maximal dynamic exercise to become predominantly aerobic. Typically, high-intensity exercises last longer before becoming aerobic.\n\nOption C (1 minute) might be a reasonable estimate considering the duration of some physical activities like sprints or burpees, but it's still unclear whether this would lead to a predominant aerobic phase.\n\nOption D (4 minutes) is more plausible as it's closer to what one would expect for prolonged exercises that gradually become aerobic. For example, during long-distance running, the initial anaerobic phase might last around 1-2 minutes before the body adapts and enters an aerobic state.\n\nWithout specific information or references, I will choose option D (4 minutes) as it seems the most reasonable estimate based on general knowledge.\", \n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
