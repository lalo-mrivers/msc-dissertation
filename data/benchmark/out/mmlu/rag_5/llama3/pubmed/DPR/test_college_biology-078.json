["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about an enzyme's activity over a broad range of pH values. Since the activity is constant, it implies that the reaction mechanism is not affected by pH changes. This suggests that ionizing groups on both the enzyme and substrate are not participating in the reaction. This rules out options C and B. Option A states that only ionizing groups on the enzyme participate, which is unlikely since the activity is constant. Therefore, option D is the most plausible answer as it implies no involvement of ionizing groups from either the enzyme or substrate.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
