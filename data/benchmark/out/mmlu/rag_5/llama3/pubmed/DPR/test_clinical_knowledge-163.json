["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about mutations in DNA. The provided documents are not related to the topic of mutations. Therefore, we must consider general knowledge of genetics to answer this question. Mutations occur spontaneously at a low rate, but they can also be induced by external factors such as carcinogens. However, the question does not provide any information about the context or type of mutation, so we cannot determine whether it is always harmful or only occurs in the presence of carcinogens. The correct answer is D: occur spontaneously at a low rate.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
