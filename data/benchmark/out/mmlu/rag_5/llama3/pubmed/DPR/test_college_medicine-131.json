["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the initial energy source for very high force contractions lasting 1-2 seconds. The key phrase here is 'high force' which suggests that we are talking about anaerobic metabolism, as anaerobic pathways are capable of producing a large amount of energy quickly. Among the options, phosphocreatine stores and ATP stores are both related to anaerobic metabolism. Phosphocreatine stores are specifically designed for short duration high intensity activities, which matches the description in the question. Therefore, we can conclude that the initial energy source is from phosphocreatine stores.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
