["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about biological attributes that would allow a species to become cosmopolitan in distribution. Cosmopolitan means widely distributed across different regions or habitats. Considering the options, we can eliminate extreme habitat specialization (A) because it would actually restrict the species' range rather than expand it. K-selected reproductive rate (B) has nothing to do with dispersal or distribution. Limited dispersal abilities (C) is also not relevant as it's a limitation on movement, whereas cosmopolitanism requires widespread distribution. That leaves us with Capacity for long-distance dispersal (D). This attribute would allow a species to spread widely across different regions and habitats, making it a strong candidate for becoming cosmopolitan.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
