["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the fate of ammonia produced when branched chain amino acids are deaminated in muscle. The provided documents do not directly address this topic. However, I can use my medical expertise to answer this question based on general knowledge. Branched chain amino acids (BCAAs) include valine, leucine, and isoleucine. When these amino acids are deaminated in muscle, the resulting ammonia is primarily converted into urea by the urea cycle. This process takes place in the liver, not directly in muscle tissue.\", \"answer_choice\": C}"]
