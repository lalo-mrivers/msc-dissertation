["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, we can analyze the composition of bronchiole walls. In the document 'Thickness and composition of nonrespiratory bronchiolar walls in normal and emphysematous lungs with some functional implications', it is mentioned that smaller bronchioles possessed thicker walls in both normal and emphysematous groups. This suggests that the walls of bronchioles are not composed of cartilage, as this would not lead to a thickness increase in smaller bronchioles.\n\nIn the document 'A gross and microscopic study of the respiratory anatomy of the Antarctic Weddell seal, Leptonychotes weddelli', we can see that the Weddell seal has hyaline cartilage in the tracheo-bronchial tree as far as the terminal bronchioles. However, this does not provide any information about the composition of non-respiratory bronchioles.\n\nThe document 'Intrapulmonary airway morphology in three species of monkeys: a correlated scanning and transmission electron microscopic study' describes the lining epithelium of respiratory bronchioles to be simple, nonciliated cuboidal and squamous. It does not provide any information about the composition of the walls themselves.\n\nFinally, the document 'Further observations on luminal deformity and stenosis of nonrespiratory bronchioles in pulmonary emphysema' describes the results of assessing the lumina of non-respiratory bronchioles for two- and three-dimensional features. However, it does not provide any information about the composition of the walls.\n\nBased on this analysis, we can conclude that the presence of cartilage is unlikely to be a characteristic of bronchiole walls.\", \n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
