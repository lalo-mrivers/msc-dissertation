["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe various aspects of RNA synthesis and processing. In [Escherichia coli K12 mutant with increased RNA content and messenger RNA stability], the primary alteration is at the RNA polymerase level, which leads to an increase in ribosomal RNA synthesis. In [Rates of synthesis of polyadenylated messenger RNA and ribosomal RNA during the cell cycle of Schizosaccharomyces pombe], it is shown that gene number controls the rate of messenger and ribosomal RNA synthesis. The [Initiation of synthesis of messenger RNA of deoxynucleotide kinase by oligoribonucleotides] article discusses the initiation of synthesis of mRNA, including the role of nucleoside triphosphates and oligoribonucleotides. Finally, in [Structural organization and processing of the genetic transcript in the cellular slime mold Dictyostelium discoideum], it is described how heterogeneous nuclear RNA (HNRNA) is synthesized and processed into mRNA.\n\nConsidering these documents, it can be inferred that transcription of DNA to a molecule of messenger RNA occurs in the nucleus.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
