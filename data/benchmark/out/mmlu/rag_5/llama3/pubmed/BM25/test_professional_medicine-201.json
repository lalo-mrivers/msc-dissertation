["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has insomnia with early awakening at night. He has no difficulty falling asleep but wakes up between 2:00 and 3:00 AM. The patient's physical examination is normal, and there are no obvious underlying medical conditions that would contribute to his insomnia. His bedtime drink of one cup of coffee in the morning with breakfast does not seem relevant to his insomnia as he doesn't consume it at night. His pre-bedtime habit of having one alcoholic beverage may be contributing to his insomnia. The patient's vital signs are normal, and there is no indication of depression or other mental health issues.\n\nConsidering the patient's age, physical examination, and sleep pattern, it seems that the most likely cause of his insomnia is his pre-bedtime consumption of alcohol. Stopping this habit may help resolve his insomnia. Therefore, I would recommend advising the patient to discontinue his bedtime drink of alcohol.\", \"answer_choice\": A}"]
