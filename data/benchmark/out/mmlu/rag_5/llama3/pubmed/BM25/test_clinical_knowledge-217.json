["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the effects of endurance training on muscle capacity. The relevant documents discuss the activation of tissue oxidative capacity by dichloroacetate (DCA) administration or endurance training on oxidative removal of lactate, and the effects of exercise training on abdominal expiratory muscles. Endurance training increases the activity of selected beta oxidation and Krebs cycle enzymes in abdominal expiratory muscles. Additionally, endurance training increases fatty acid oxidation capacity (FAO) in skeletal muscle. This suggests that endurance training increases the muscle's capacity to burn fat and carbohydrate.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
