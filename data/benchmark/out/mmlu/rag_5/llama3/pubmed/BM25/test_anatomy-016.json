["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking which muscles are normally active during quiet inspiration. The relevant document for this question is 'Single motor unit activity of human intrinsic laryngeal muscles during respiration.' This document states that the rate of firing was higher during inhalation than during exhalation in phasic units and in tonic units of both thyroarytenoid (TA) and cricothyroid (CT) muscles. This suggests that there is modulation by the respiratory cycle, which implies that the diaphragm is likely involved. Additionally, the document mentions that laryngeal motoneurons are modulated by the respiratory cycle, but do not respond uniformly to respiration.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: External and internal intercostal muscles and diaphragm\"\n}"]
