["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the potential presence of certain substances or structures in connective tissue. We look at the provided documents to see if they provide information on these substances. Document 1 discusses ultrastructure of nuclear bodies in connective tissue cells and mentions an activation of connective tissue cell metabolism, which might imply the presence of enzymes such as lipase mentioned in Document 4. Document 2 describes the distribution of somite cells and does not mention any specific substances found in connective tissue. Document 3 discusses glycosaminoglycans and fibrillar collagen in Priapulida but does not mention thrombin or fibroblasts. Document 4 is about biogenic amines and connective tissue in the process of chemical carcinogenesis, which mentions enzymes like nonspecific esterase, lipase, and monoaminoxidase, as well as glycosaminoglycans (Document 3). Thrombin is not mentioned in any document. Fibroblasts are indeed found in connective tissue cells. Collagens are also present in connective tissue.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
