["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The document 'Localization of chitin in algal and fungal cell walls by light and electron microscopy' provides information about the localization of chitin in fungal cell walls. It mentions that areas of chitin deposition appeared dark brown by light microscopy and electron dense in the electron microscope. This suggests that chitin is present in the cell walls of fungi. Therefore, it can be concluded that in fungi, cell walls are reinforced by Chitin.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
