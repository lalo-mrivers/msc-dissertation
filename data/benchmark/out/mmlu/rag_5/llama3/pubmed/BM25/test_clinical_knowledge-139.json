["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the 'normal' range of flexion at the knee joint. We can look at the first document, which discusses a rehabilitation program following polycentric total knee arthroplasty. The specific objectives include flexion of the knee to at least 90 degrees. This implies that 90 degrees is a minimum normal range of flexion for the knee joint.\n\nWe can also refer to the second document, which evaluates the predictive range of motion after total knee replacement. Although it doesn't provide a direct answer, we can infer from its findings that the amount of flexion achievable postoperatively may be determined by the amount of flexion the patient had preoperatively, especially if the degree of flexion was less than 75 degrees.\n\nThe third document discusses the range of joint motions in healthy Japanese people. It shows that knee flexion shows little change with age, but its value can exceed the normal range indicated by associations.\n\nThe fourth document examines the effects of implant design on range of motion after total knee arthroplasty. While it doesn't provide a direct answer to our question, it does suggest that determinants of flexion after TKA are multifactorial and outcome data limited, notwithstanding the similarities among modern prostheses.\n\nBased on these findings, we can conclude that 0-90 degrees is likely within the normal range of flexion at the knee joint.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
