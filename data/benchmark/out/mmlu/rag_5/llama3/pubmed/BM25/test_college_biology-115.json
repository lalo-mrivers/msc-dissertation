["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about a competitive inhibitor's effect on an enzyme. A quick glance at the provided documents reveals that Procaine HCl (Gerovital H3) is a fully competitive inhibitor of monoamine oxidase, while NPC 15437 is also a competitive inhibitor of protein kinase C interacting at the regulatory domain. Additionally, a fluorescent probe in the document 'Observations on the conformational changes in the structure of a cell surface protease...' binds to the active centre of the cell surface enzyme in a competitive manner. From these examples, we can conclude that competitive inhibitors compete with the substrate molecule for the same enzyme but a different binding site than the substrate binding site.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
