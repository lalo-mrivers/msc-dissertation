["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant document for this question is [Mechanical ventilation in rats]. The study describes the setting of a mechanical ventilator for small animals. The parameters set were: rate of 60/min; flow rate 0.2 l/min; I:E 1:2; PEEP 0 cm H2O; PIP 6.7 +/- 0.5 (mean +/- SD) cm H2O and sharp waves. Since the study is about mechanical ventilation in rats, it can't provide information on a normal respiratory rate for an adult male. Therefore, we need to look at other documents.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
