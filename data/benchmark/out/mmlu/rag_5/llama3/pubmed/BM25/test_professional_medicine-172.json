["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about α-thalassemia. The woman has a single gene deletion, which means she is heterozygous for the condition. The man has a two-gene deletion, which means he is also heterozygous for the condition. Since they are both carriers of α-thalassemia, their offspring will inherit one copy of the deleted genes from each parent. If the two-gene deletion is in trans (one deletion on the maternal gene and one deletion on the paternal gene), then the offspring will have a two-gene deletion if they inherit one deleted gene from the mother and one deleted gene from the father. Since both parents are carriers, the probability of inheriting one deleted gene from each parent is 50%. Therefore, 50% of their offspring will have a two-gene deletion.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
