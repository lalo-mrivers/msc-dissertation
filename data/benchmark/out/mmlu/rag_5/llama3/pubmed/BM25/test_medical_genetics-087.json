["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the effect of mutations that cause achondroplasia. The passage does not mention achondroplasia directly, but it mentions pseudoachondroplasia and achondroplasia as autosomal dominant skeletal dysplasias resulting in short-limbed dwarfism. Since no gross alterations at the CSPGCP locus were noted in DNA from individuals with achondroplasia or pseudoachondroplasia, it suggests that the mutations causing achondroplasia are not at the CSPGCP locus.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: loss-of-function\""]
