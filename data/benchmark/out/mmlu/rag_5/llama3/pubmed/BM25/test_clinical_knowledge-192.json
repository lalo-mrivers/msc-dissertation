["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the products of ADP degradation that increase in concentration during multiple sprint sports. From the documents provided, we can see that ADP degradation occurs during intense exercise, leading to the formation of IMP and uric acid. In the first document, it states 'We suggest that IMP formation occurs as a result of a sudden rise in the concentration of adenosine 5'-diphosphate (ADP) and consequently the concentration of adenosine 5'-monophosphate.' This suggests that ADP degradation leads to the increase in IMP. Additionally, uric acid is mentioned as another product of ADP degradation. Ammonia is not mentioned as a product of ADP degradation in any of the documents.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A: Ammonia, hypoxanthine and uric acid.\""]
