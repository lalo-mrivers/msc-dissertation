["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The provided documents are related to DNA sequences of various organisms. The human cytomegalovirus genome encodes approximately 200 genes. Since a gene typically codes for a protein, we can estimate the fraction of the human genome that encodes proteins. However, this requires knowledge about the size of the human genome. According to the DNA sequence of the human cytomegalovirus genome, the virus has a 229 kilobase pair DNA genome. The human genome is significantly larger than this. Assuming an average gene size of around 1 kilobase pair (this is a rough estimate), we can estimate that there are approximately 200,000-300,000 genes in the human genome (based on the total number of base pairs in the human genome and assuming an average gene size of around 1 kilobase pair). Therefore, about 2% of the human genome would be dedicated to encoding proteins.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
