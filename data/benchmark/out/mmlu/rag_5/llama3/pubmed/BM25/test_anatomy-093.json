["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the origin and filling of the coronary arteries. The relevant documents are [Fate of ischemic heart disease patients depending on the nature of the coronary artery lesion], [Angiographic evaluation of the natural history of normal coronary arteries and mild coronary atherosclerosis], and [Coronary effects of nicorandil in comparison with nitroglycerin in chronic conscious dogs]. The first document states that the study made it possible to establish the prognostic significance of angiographic and clinical data. The second document separates patients into two groups according to the results of the first angiogram, Group I included 22 patients with normal coronary arteries and Group II included 26 patients with coronary stenosis of less than 50%. The third document describes the effects of nicorandil on large and small coronary arteries in conscious dogs. From these documents, it is clear that the origin of the coronary arteries is from the ascending aorta, not the arch of the aorta. Additionally, the filling of the coronary arteries occurs during diastole, as mentioned in the third document. Therefore, the correct answer is D: arise from the ascending aorta and fill during diastole.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
