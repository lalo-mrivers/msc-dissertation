["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the characteristics of fast-twitch fibres. We need to find information about mitochondria and ATPase activity in fast-twitch fibres. In 'Activities of malate dehydrogenase, 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase and fructose-1,6-diphosphatase with regard to metabolic subpopulations of fast- and slow-twitch fibres in rabbit muscles', we can see that FDPase is found at extremely low activities in slow-twitch fibres and relatively high activity in fast-twitch fibres. This suggests that fast-twitch fibres have a higher ATPase activity. In 'Time dependent effects on contractile properties, fibre population, myosin light chains and enzymes of energy metabolism in intermittently and continuously stimulated fast twitch muscles of the rabbit', we can see that even with changes in fibre population and myosin light chain pattern, there are no parallel changes in ATPase activity.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
