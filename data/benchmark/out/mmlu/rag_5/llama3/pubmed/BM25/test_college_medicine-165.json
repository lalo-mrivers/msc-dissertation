["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the free energy of electron pairs FADH2 and NADH+H. From the provided documents, we know that FADH2 is involved in energy transfer reactions, but there's no direct information about its free energy. On the other hand, NADH+H is not mentioned at all in the provided documents. Therefore, it seems reasonable to assume that only FADH2 is relevant for this question. The energy transfer reactions involving FADH2 seem to be related to photoreactivation processes, which involve DNA repair. In these processes, the excited singlet state of 8-HDF transfers energy to FADH2 at a rate of 1.9 x 10^10 s^-1 and a quantum yield of 0.98. This suggests that FADH2 is capable of accepting energy from other molecules, which could contribute to its free energy.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
