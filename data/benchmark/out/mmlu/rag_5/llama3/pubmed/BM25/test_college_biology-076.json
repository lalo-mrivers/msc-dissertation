["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the documents provided, we can see that chromosome segregation involves proper arrangement of kinetochores for spindle attachment, followed by spindle attachment and chromosome movement. The predicted amino-acid sequence of a product encoded at the claret locus in Drosophila is related to the heavy chain of kinesin and includes the ATP-binding site and a region that can bind microtubules. Additionally, CENP-E accumulates just before mitosis and associates with kinetochores during congression, relocates to the spindle midzone at anaphase, and is quantitatively discarded at the end of the cell division. This suggests that the kinetochore plays a crucial role in attachment by the mitotic spindle.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C\n}"]
