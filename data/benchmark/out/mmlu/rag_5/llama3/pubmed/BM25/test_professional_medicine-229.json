["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has a history of lung cancer treated with radiation therapy 6 months ago. She is experiencing easy bruising for 4 months, which may be related to the previous treatment. The platelet count is low at 35,000/mm3, which could be a sign of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). The patient's history and laboratory results suggest that DIC should be considered as a possible diagnosis. A study on 'Change in the acid protease activity in plasma of patients with disseminated intravascular coagulation' suggests that cathepsin D, a lysosomal protease, can be detected in the serum of patients with DIC. Therefore, the most appropriate next step in diagnosis would be to order a cathepsin D activity test to confirm or rule out DIC.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
