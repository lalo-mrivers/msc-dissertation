["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about a very weak base. We can find information about pKb values from the document 'Effect of pKb on lipophilic binding of disopyramide derivatives to human plasma'. According to this document, the extent of interaction between drugs and human plasma was found to be inversely proportional to the magnitude of the pKb value. This means that as the pKb value increases, the extent of interaction decreases. For a very weak base, its pKb would likely be higher than the pOH.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
