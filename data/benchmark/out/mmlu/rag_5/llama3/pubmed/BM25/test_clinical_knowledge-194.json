["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the complete resynthesis of phosphocreatine after very high intensity exercise. From the provided documents, we know that the time course of phosphorylcreatine resynthesis during recovery is biphasic, exhibiting a fast and slow recovery component. The half-time for the fast component was 21-22s, but this accounted for a smaller fraction of the total PC restored during recovery from the isometric contraction than after the dynamic exercise. Therefore, the complete resynthesis of phosphocreatine would likely take longer than the fast component.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
