["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about a 57-year-old man with squamous cell carcinoma of the lung who received radiation therapy. Despite therapy, the tumor progressed and he died 6 months later. The mutation found in his p53 gene (TP53) led to an inactive gene product. This information suggests that the p53 gene plays a crucial role in regulating cell cycle arrest. Since the patient's tumor cells contain a point mutation in the p53 gene, it is likely that the progressive tumor growth despite irradiation therapy is related to a defect in cell cycle arrest.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
