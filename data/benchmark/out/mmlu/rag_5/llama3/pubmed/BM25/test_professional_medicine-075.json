["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, we can see that the patient has systemic sclerosis (scleroderma) with progressive shortness of breath and nonproductive cough. The pulmonary function tests show a reduced total lung capacity and diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide, corrected for alveolar volume. This suggests that the patient's lung disease is likely to be interstitial in nature. Therefore, we can infer that the histologic examination of the lung biopsy specimen would most likely show diffuse interstitial fibrosis.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
