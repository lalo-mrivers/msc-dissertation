["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents discuss wound drainage in various contexts. The first document discusses the frequency of wound infection in kidney transplant patients and advises that when possible, wound drainage should be avoided. The second document provides guidelines for antibacterial suction-drainage of surgical infections and osteomyelitic cavities, including ensuring free flow of the irrigation fluid and positioning of the perforated drain. It does not provide information on assessing volume and consistency of wound drainage. The third document discusses simple wounds and incisions, but does not provide information on wound drainage.
