["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the differential distribution of substances in the egg. We can analyze this by looking at the documents provided. From 'Physiology of sexual reproduction', we know that during megasporogenesis and megagametogenesis, extensive changes occur in enzyme activity and reserve substances. This suggests a differential distribution of substances within the embryo sac. In the matured embryo sac, different cells have differential localization of the substances. This is also seen in 'The influence of some fractions of egg yolk', where the low-density lipoprotein fraction of egg yolk gives greater protection to ram spermatozoa. This implies that there may be a specific distribution of substances within the egg yolk as well. Finally, from 'Differential extractability of calcium and pectic substances', we know that pectic substances are linked by calcium bridges in certain regions of the cell wall. All these documents suggest that differential distribution of substances is typical in the egg.\",\n\"answer_choice\": A\n}"]
