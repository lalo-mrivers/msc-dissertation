["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for the rate of energy expenditure given a mean rate of oxygen consumption. We need to find the relationship between oxygen consumption and energy expenditure from one of the provided documents. The document 'Oxygen cost and energy expenditure of running in trained runners' provides this information, specifically that the caloric cost per unit distance and time increased with acceleration in running speed. Therefore, we can use this information to estimate the rate of energy expenditure.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
