["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To find the genotype frequency of heterozygotes, we first need to calculate the expected genotype frequencies under Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. The frequency of the two alleles is given as 0.6 and 0.4. We can use the Hardy-Weinberg equation for the frequency of heterozygotes (p^2 + q^2 - p) = 2pq, where p is the frequency of one allele and q is the frequency of the other allele. Substituting the given frequencies, we get: 0.6^2 + 0.4^2 - 0.6*0.4 = 0.36 + 0.16 - 0.24 = 0.48.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
