["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"I reviewed the provided documents, which are unrelated to the question about glycogen or insulin. Therefore, I will rely on my general medical knowledge to answer this question. Muscle glycogen is indeed broken down enzymatically to glucose-1-phosphate (A). Elite endurance runners have a high proportion of Type I fibers in their leg muscles (B). Liver glycogen plays an important role in maintaining the blood glucose concentration by releasing glucose into the bloodstream during fasting or when glucose demands increase (C). Insulin promotes glucose uptake primarily by insulin-sensitive tissues, such as skeletal muscle and adipose tissue, but not by all tissues in the body (D). Therefore, statement D is not true.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
