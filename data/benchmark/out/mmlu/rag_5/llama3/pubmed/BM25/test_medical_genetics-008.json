["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the risk of abnormality in a child born to a mother with untreated phenylketonuria. The relevant document mentions that both children (one with PKU and one without) from an untreated pregnancy had similar congenital anomalies, microcephaly, and mental retardation. This experience and review of the literature indicate that the residual liver phenylalanine hydroxylase activity of a nonphenylketonuric fetus offers little or no protection from damage in untreated maternal PKU. Therefore, it is likely that the outcome in maternal PKU will depend on control of the maternal biochemical abnormalities in the mother regardless of whether the fetus has or does not have PKU.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
