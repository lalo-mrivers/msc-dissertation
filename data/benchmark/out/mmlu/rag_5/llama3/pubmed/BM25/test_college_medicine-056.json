["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks what happens when branched chain amino acids are deaminated in muscle. According to the first document, ammonia production in skeletal muscle involves the purine nucleotide cycle and the amino acids glutamate, glutamine, and alanine and probably also includes the branched chain amino acids as well as aspartate. During prolonged exercise that requires 60-80% VO2max, it is proposed that the ammonia produced from slow twitch fibers comes from the deamination of branched chain amino acids.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
