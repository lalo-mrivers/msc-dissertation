["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The concept of an allele being 'masked' is discussed in the context of the 54-kDa sperm surface sialoglycoprotein on the flagellum.

This suggests that the term 'masked' refers to the biochemical nature of the epitope region being closely related to the sialic acid, rather than any genetic or recessive relationship.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C: repressed.\"}"]
