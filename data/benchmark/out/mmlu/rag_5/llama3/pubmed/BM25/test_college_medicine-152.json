["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents provided describe the mechanism of muscle contraction, highlighting the role of ATP hydrolysis in providing energy for the process. The high thermodynamic efficiency of muscle contraction is difficult to explain on the basis of present theories, and a model proposing an approximate chemimechanic equilibrium between chemical and mechanical forces throughout the transfer of free energy has been proposed. This suggests that ATP is the primary source of energy for muscle contraction.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
