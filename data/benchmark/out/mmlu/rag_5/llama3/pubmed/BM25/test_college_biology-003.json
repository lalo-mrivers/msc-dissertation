["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks for a second messenger that stimulates the release of calcium ions into the cytoplasm. From the provided documents, we can see that ionomycin forms a lipid-soluble calcium complex, which conveys Ca2+ across the hydrocarbon region of the cell membrane and stimulates mast cell secretion. Similarly, PTH increases calcium influx and permeability to calcium in bone cells. In contrast, ACTH activates steroidogenesis by serving as a first messenger, and extracellular calcium ions can also serve as a first messenger activating steroidogenesis if isolated adrenocortical cells are pretreated in an appropriate ionic environment.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
