["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the developmental defects that occur when homeotic cluster genes are mutated. The provided documents describe the role of homeotic genes in determining which structures form in each body segment and the consequences of disrupting their function. According to these descriptions, loss-of-function mutations in the brm gene cause developmental defects similar to those arising from insufficient expression of the homeotic genes of the Antennapedia and Bithorax complexes, which suggests that homeotic cluster genes are required for the correct development of body segments. Therefore, one expects that mutation of these genes would result in developmental defects.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B: Transformation of one segment into another\"\n}"]
