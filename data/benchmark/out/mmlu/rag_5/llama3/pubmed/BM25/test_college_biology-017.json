["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the development of an adult song repertoire in a young male bird reared in isolation. The key phrase is 'he will develop an adult song repertoire that lacks certain characteristics typical of his own species'. This suggests that the bird's own species has some distinct characteristics, but these are not present in the bird reared in isolation. Therefore, it can be inferred that the absence of auditory feedback during development plays a crucial role in shaping the bird's adult song repertoire. The relevant documents suggest that auditory feedback is necessary for the maintenance of stereotyped song in adult zebra finches, and that continued auditory input is necessary to maintain the patterns of neural organization supporting learned song.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
