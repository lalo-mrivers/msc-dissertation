["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has a 1-week history of progressive dyspnea and wheezing, which is likely related to her cardiovascular condition. The pulse oximetry shows an oxygen saturation of 92% on 100% oxygen, suggesting that she may have a cyanotic heart disease. The auscultation reveals decreased breath sounds at the bases with expiratory crackles bilaterally, which could be indicative of pulmonary edema or congestion. The cardiac examination discloses an irregularly irregular rhythm and a grade 3/6 diastolic murmur at the apex, which is consistent with atrial fibrillation. Additionally, the patient's medical history of hypothyroidism and her symptoms are unlikely to cause these findings.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the most likely cause of the findings in this patient is likely related to congenital heart disease.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: Mitral stenosis complicated by atrial fibrillation\""]
