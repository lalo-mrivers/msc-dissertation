["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant information for this question is from the documents about the effects of pH on the myofilaments and the sarcoplasmic reticulum of skinned cells from cardiac and skeletal muscles. The documents highlight that the sarcoplasmic reticulum plays a role in storing and releasing calcium ions, which is essential for muscle contractions. Additionally, the regulation of sarcoplasmic reticulum gene expression during cardiac and skeletal muscle development suggests that this organelle is involved in muscle function.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
