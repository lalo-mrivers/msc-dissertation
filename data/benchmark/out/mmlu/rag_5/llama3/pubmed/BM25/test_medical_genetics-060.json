["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks what happens to the inbreeding coefficient F when it increases. In general, an increase in the inbreeding coefficient F means that there is a greater likelihood of self-fertilization and homozygosity in the population. This is because inbreeding increases the chance of two alleles being identical by descent, which results in a higher proportion of homozygous individuals. As a result, we would expect a reduced likelihood of heterozygotes being present in the population.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
