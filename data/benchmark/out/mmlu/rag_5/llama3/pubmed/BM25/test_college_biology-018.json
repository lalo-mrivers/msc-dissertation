["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Retrotransposons are mobile genetic elements that move from one site to another in the genome without replication. They replicate via an RNA intermediate, using a 'copy and paste' mechanism. Therefore, option C: A DNA sequence that replicates via an RNA intermediate is the most accurate description of a retrotransposon.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
