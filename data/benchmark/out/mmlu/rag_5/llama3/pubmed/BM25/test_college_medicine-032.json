["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The sound waves progress through a medium at a velocity that is characteristic of that medium. In this case, the source emits a sound with certain velocity, intensity, frequency, and wavelength from one medium to another denser medium. When the sound exits the first medium and enters the second denser medium, its behavior changes. The physics of diagnostic ultrasound states that wavelength and frequency are inversely related, so that short wavelengths can only be obtained at higher frequencies. Additionally, the attenuation of beams of sound in tissue at ultrasonic frequencies is directly and almost linearly related to frequency. Therefore, when the sound enters a denser medium, its velocity remains constant as it is characteristic of the medium, but its intensity decreases due to the increased density and absorption by the medium. The wavelength and frequency also change inversely proportionally.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
