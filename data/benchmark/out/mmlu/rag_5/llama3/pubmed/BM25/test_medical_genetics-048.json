["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for the proportion of genes shared by first cousins. According to the document 'Application of a recombination model in calculating the variance of sib pair genetic identity', we can calculate analytically the variance in the proportion of genes identical by descent shared by two sibs. For first cousins, this means that any two identity by descent values within a sibship are uncorrelated. Therefore, we need to consider the probability of sharing one gene identical by descent and multiply it by itself since there are two genes to share. This gives us 1/4.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
