["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for the daily dose of Cotrimoxazole in grams. Since it's prescribed every 12 hours, that means there are two doses per day. Each dose is 960 mg, so to find the total daily dose, we multiply 960 by 2. This gives us a total daily dose of 1920 mg.
