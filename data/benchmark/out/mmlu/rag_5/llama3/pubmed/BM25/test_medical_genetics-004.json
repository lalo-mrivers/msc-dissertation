["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the pattern of inheritance shown by malignant hyperthermia. The provided documents describe the association between a cysteine-for-arginine substitution (R614C) in the human skeletal muscle calcium release channel and malignant hyperthermia. This suggests that the disorder has a Mendelian inheritance pattern. A family study shows that the mutation cosegregates with malignant hyperthermia, indicating an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
