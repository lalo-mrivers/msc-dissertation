["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to the first document 'Metabolic factors in fatigue', during exercise intensity is linearly related to the rate of energy utilisation. Since the maximal duration of exercise is negatively related to the relative intensity, this suggests that energetic deficiency plays a major role in the aetiology of muscle fatigue. In the second document 'Skeletal muscle energy metabolism and fatigue during intense exercise in man', ATP is the sole fuel for muscle contraction. During near maximal intense exercise, the muscle store of ATP will be depleted in < 1s. Therefore, to maintain normal contractile function ATP must be continually resynthesized.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
