["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The new enzyme is found to participate in synthesis of an unknown product using two reactants. The radiolabeled compounds show that the enzyme catalyzes a process that switches a nitrogen group on one reactant to the other reactant. This suggests that the enzyme is involved in amino acid modification, specifically transamination. Transamination is a reaction where a nitrogen group from one molecule is transferred to another molecule. Based on this information, we can conclude that the new enzyme falls under the category of Transferase.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
