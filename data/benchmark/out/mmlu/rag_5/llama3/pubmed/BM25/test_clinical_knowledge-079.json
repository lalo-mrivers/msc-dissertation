["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents discuss various aspects of ileostomy, including the technique used to perform lateral exclusion and terminal ileostomy according to Turnbull's method. The first document describes a procedure that permits perfect exclusion, easy fitting of an ileostomy bag, and easy secondary closure. This suggests that the length and position of the ileostomy opening are important considerations. The second document discusses the treatment of pseudomembranous colitis with a completely diverting ileostomy, but does not provide specific information about the size or location of the opening. The third document evaluates the effect of different medications on ileostomy function, but does not address the characteristics of the opening itself. The fourth and fifth documents discuss continent ileostomies, which are designed to be more discreet and easier to manage than traditional ileostomies. However, they do not provide specific information about the size or location of the opening. In summary, while there is some general discussion of ileostomy technique and management, there is no specific information that would directly address the question of the ideal size and location of an ileostomy opening.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
