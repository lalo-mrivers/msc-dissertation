["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with sudden onset of shortness of breath, severe chest pain, and sweating. He has a history of hypertension and smoking. A diastolic blowing murmur is heard over the left sternal border and radiates to the right sternal border, with decreased femoral pulses bilaterally. The ECG shows left ventricular hypertrophy.\\r\\n\\r\\nGiven these symptoms and findings, I would rule out mitral valve prolapse (D) as it does not fit with the patient's presentation.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe diastolic murmur and radiating pattern suggest aortic involvement, making aortic dissection (B) a possibility. However, the patient's age, lack of history of similar symptoms, and absence of other signs of dissection such as back pain or syncope make this diagnosis less likely.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ECG findings of left ventricular hypertrophy and the presence of chest pain suggest cardiac involvement, making acute myocardial infarction (A) a possibility. However, the patient's age, hypertension, and smoking history increase his risk for cardiovascular disease, but do not specifically point to acute coronary syndrome.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe most likely diagnosis based on the patient's symptoms and findings is therefore A: Acute myocardial infarction.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
