["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the bones that develop by endochondral ossification. The relevant documents mention the development of the bony skull in chick embryos with unilateral anotia and the effects of experimental unilateral anotia on skull development in the chick embryo. These studies suggest that the perichondral bones initially follow exactly the cartilaginous structures to which they are related, and later may expand desmally to fill up the gaps and diminish the degree of pre-existing asymmetry. This indicates that endochondral ossification is a process that occurs in certain types of bones.\n\nThe documents also mention the study of chondrodysplastic short-limbed dwarfism in early infancy, which provides additional diagnostic criteria for these disorders. The histopathologic findings were sufficiently distinctive to provide additional diagnostic criteria and contribute to the understanding and delineation of these disorders. This suggests that endochondral ossification is a process that occurs in certain types of bones.\n\nThe documents also mention the study of total and local X-radiation effects on 18F uptake of bones, which showed a higher concentration of the isotope in the metaphyseal area of the endochondral plate. This suggests that endochondral ossification is a process that occurs in certain types of bones.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, it can be concluded that the bones that develop by endochondral ossification are the perichondral bones of the skull and the ribs.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: The ribs, sternum, clavicle and vertebrae\""]
