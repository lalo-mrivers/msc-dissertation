["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents discuss the effects of mycorrhizal fungi on plant growth, nutrient uptake, and synthesis of volatile oil. The first document mentions that a satisfactory nodulation was greatly dependent on the mycorrhizal symbiosis, suggesting a benefit to the plant. The second document highlights the ability of mycorrhizal fungi to improve plant growth, nodulation, and mycorhiza formation. The third document discusses the use of pectinolytic ability of some mycorrhizal and saprophytic hymenomycetes. However, there is no mention of desiccation, nitrogen fixation, or carbon provision in these documents. Therefore, the benefit conferred to many plants by mycorrhizal fungi must be related to phosphorus.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
