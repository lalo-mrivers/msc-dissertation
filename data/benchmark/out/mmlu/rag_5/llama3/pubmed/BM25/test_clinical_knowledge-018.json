["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about reflexes. We need to find a relevant document that talks about reflexes. The documents provided are not directly related to reflexes. However, we can look for information on the supplementary motor area and its relation to motor cortex reflexes in the 'Does the supplementary motor area play a part in modifying motor cortex reflexes?' document. According to this document, the Supplementary Motor Area (SMA) is involved in modulating responsiveness of the motor cortex to sensory inputs in association with learned movements. This information does not directly answer the question about plantar reflex or ankle reflex. Therefore, we need to look for other relevant sources.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
