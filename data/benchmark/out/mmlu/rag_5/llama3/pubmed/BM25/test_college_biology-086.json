["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the crouching of very young birds in response to a predator's shape overhead. The relevant documents are the ones discussing animal behavior. In the document 'Defensive distance and immobility in young precocial birds (Gallus gallus)', it is mentioned that young birds are susceptible to immobility and that the maintenance of close spatial proximity is the condition necessary for the occurrence of the reaction in young precocial birds. The crouching behavior described in the question seems similar to this reaction, so it is likely an example of immobility.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
