["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the first fibre types to fatigue during an all-out exercise such as sprinting. From the provided documents, we know that during intense exercise (from approximately 75% VO2 max to near maximal workloads) this is achieved principally by the oxidation of carbohydrate and the anaerobic utilization of phosphocreatine (PCr) and carbohydrate. The relative contribution of carbohydrate oxidation to total energy provision decreases, while that from anaerobic utilization increases. During short-lasting near-maximal exercise (0-30 s), the anaerobic utilization of muscle PCr and glycogen will fuel muscle contraction. Evidence is available to indicate that fatigue during this type of exercise is related to the inability of type II fibres to maintain the required very high rate of ATP resynthesis.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: Type IIX fibres.\""]
