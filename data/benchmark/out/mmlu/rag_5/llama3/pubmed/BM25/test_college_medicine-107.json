["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the rate-limiting enzyme of glycolysis. We can look at the documents for information on glycolysis. In the first document, it is mentioned that phosphorylation of glucose by glucokinase appears to be limiting for glycolysis. This suggests that glucokinase may be the rate-limiting enzyme. However, we also need to consider other options. In the second and third documents, there is no direct information on the rate-limiting enzyme. In the fourth document, it mentions that phosphofructokinase (PFK) has a high activity in glycolysis. This suggests that PFK may be involved in glycolysis but does not necessarily mean it is the rate-limiting enzyme. The fifth document discusses creatine phosphate synthesis and glycolytic reactions, but it does not provide direct information on the rate-limiting enzyme. Therefore, we need to weigh the evidence from different documents.\", \"answer_choice\": D}"]
