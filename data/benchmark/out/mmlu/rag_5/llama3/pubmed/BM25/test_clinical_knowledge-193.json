["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the optimum position for performing CPR. We need to look at the relevant documents provided. The document 'Metabolic demands and perceived exertion during cardiopulmonary resuscitation' discusses the demands of CPR. It does not mention the position of the patient, so we cannot find the answer here. We also have a separate study on variables in recording motor conduction of the radial nerve that mentions positions for stimulation, but it is not related to CPR. The remaining two documents do not provide any information about CPR or its optimum position.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
