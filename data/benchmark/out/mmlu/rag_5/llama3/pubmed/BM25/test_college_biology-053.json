["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks for experimental observations that would be expected. We know that binding of ZP3 receptors to ZP3 initiates the sperm's acrosomal reaction. Injecting eggs with antibodies that bind to ZP3 and incubating eggs with antibodies that bind to ZP3 would both block in vitro fertilization because they would prevent the sperm from binding to the egg. Incubating sperm with purified ZP3 prior to mixing sperm and eggs would also block in vitro fertilization because it would trigger the acrosomal reaction before the sperm can bind to the egg. Coating synthetic beads with a different glycoprotein, ZP2, would not affect sperm aggregation on the beads because the sperm are binding to ZP3, not ZP2.\", \"answer_choice\": C}"]
