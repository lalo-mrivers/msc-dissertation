["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with a bloody nose that has been dripping out his nares for the past 2 hours. He denies any trauma or upper respiratory illness. His blood pressure is elevated at 180/90 mmHg, which suggests possible hypertension as an underlying cause of his bleeding. The examination reveals that the site of bleeding is on the septal mucosa of the right naris. This could be due to a number of factors, including hypertension-related changes in nasal anatomy or bleeding from a submucosal vessel. Given the location and nature of the bleeding, anterior packing or pinching the nares together for 5 minutes may not be the most appropriate next steps as they could potentially worsen the situation.
