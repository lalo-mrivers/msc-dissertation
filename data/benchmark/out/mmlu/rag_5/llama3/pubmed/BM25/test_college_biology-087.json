["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the intensity of competition between males or females in a primate species. Based on the provided documents, we can see that sexual dimorphism is closely related to intrasexual competition, particularly among anthropoid primates. In the first document, it states that intermale competition explains a large proportion of the variation in canine dimorphism, and predation also has an effect. Body-weight dimorphism is associated with canine dimorphism, but diet plays no role.\n\nThe second document discusses prosimian primates, where sexual dimorphism is not uniform across all species. However, it suggests that phylogenetic inertia cannot provide a causal explanation for the evolution of sexual dimorphism.\n\nIn the third document, it examines patterns of sexual dimorphism in body weight among prosimian primates and finds significant heterogeneity at the family level. The fourth document discusses human marriage systems and sexual dimorphism in stature, where cross-cultural differences are not consistent with expectations from sexual selection theory.\n\nThe fifth document discusses mandible shape analysis in a testicular feminization strain of mice and suggests that androgens play a role in mandibular development in both males and females.\n\nConsidering these documents, we can conclude that among primates, a high degree of sexual dimorphism is often associated with intense competition between males.\", \n\"answer_choice\": B"]
