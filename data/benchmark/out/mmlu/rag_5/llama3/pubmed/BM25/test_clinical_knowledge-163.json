["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about mutations in DNA. We can look at the provided documents to understand what mutations are. In the document 'On the fidelity of DNA replication', it talks about errors in base-pairing and how they occur spontaneously during DNA synthesis. This suggests that mutations can occur without the presence of carcinogens or any external factors. The same document also mentions that the purified avian myeloblastosis virus DNA polymerase synthesizes polydeoxynucleotides with an unusually large number of errors in base-pairing, indicating that mutations are a natural occurrence during DNA replication.\n\nIn the document 'Mutations in the zinc fingers of ADR1 that change the specificity of DNA binding and transactivation', it talks about specific changes to the DNA sequence occurring as a result of mutations. This further supports the idea that mutations can occur spontaneously without any external factors.\n\nThe document 'HeLa cell single-stranded DNA-binding protein increases the accuracy of DNA synthesis by DNA polymerase alpha in vitro' also mentions that cellular replication factors can influence the fidelity of DNA replication, suggesting that mutations are an inherent part of the process.\n\nFinally, the document 'Initiation and termination mutants of Bacillus subtilis bacteriophage SPO1' talks about specific defects in initiation or termination of DNA replication occurring due to mutations. This further reinforces the idea that mutations can occur spontaneously during DNA replication.\n\nBased on this understanding, we can conclude that:\n\n\", \"answer_choice\": D"]
