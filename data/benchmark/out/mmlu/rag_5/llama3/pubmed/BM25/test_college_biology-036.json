["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the given documents, it can be seen that striated muscles have a different organization of contractile proteins compared to smooth muscles. In striated muscles, the basic characteristics of both types of contractile proteins are similar; but there are a variety of quantitative differences in protein structures, enzymatic activities and filament stabilities.\\nThe question asks about a sarcomere of a striated muscle (such as skeletal muscle), which is a unit of repeating elements that make up the muscle fiber. In this context, tropomyosin is associated with the thin filaments, not the thick filaments.\\nTherefore, option B is correct.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
