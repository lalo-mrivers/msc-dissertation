["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, it is clear that glycogen breakdown occurs during exercise. In the first document, we see that similar decrements in muscle glycogen levels were observed in both non-exercising and exercising muscles at the end of the 90-min exercise bout, despite significantly different activity profiles. This suggests that glycogen breakdown is not solely dependent on muscle activity or metabolic demands. Furthermore, the study found that the sum total of all accumulated glycolytic intermediates and lactate (converted to glucosyl units) in the non-exercising muscles only accounted for a small fraction of the glycogen degraded. This implies that there may be other factors contributing to glycogen breakdown.\n\nIn the second document, we see that glycogen breakdown is limited by ADP in Xenopus embryos. This suggests that ADP can activate glycogen breakdown and glycolysis. However, this study does not specifically address glycogen breakdown in exercising muscle.\n\nThe third document discusses the enzymatic breakdown of tripolyphosphate and diphosphate in comminuted meat. While it is interesting to note that the addition of MgCl2 increases the diphosphatase activity, this does not directly relate to glycogen breakdown in exercising muscle.\n\nFinally, the fourth document discusses the effect of unilateral isokinetic strength training on local adipose and muscle tissue morphology, thickness, and enzymes. While we see changes in muscle force, thickness, and enzyme activity, there is no specific discussion of glycogen breakdown or activation.\n\nIn summary, while we have some information about glycogen breakdown in general, we do not specifically see evidence that ADP or any other factor activates glycogen breakdown in exercising muscle.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: none of the above.\""]
