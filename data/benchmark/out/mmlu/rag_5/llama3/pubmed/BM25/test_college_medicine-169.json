["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about mistakes coded into the leading strand during DNA replication. Since the mistake is removed shortly following the time RNA primer is removed, this suggests that the error occurs after the RNA primer has been removed. The DNA polymerase proofreads the DNA chain as it is being synthesized, checking for any incorrect nucleotides and removing them if necessary. This process occurs in the control section of a proofreading 3' to 5' exonuclease. Therefore, the most likely repair mechanism responsible for removing the incorrect base is the 3' to 5' exonuclease.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
