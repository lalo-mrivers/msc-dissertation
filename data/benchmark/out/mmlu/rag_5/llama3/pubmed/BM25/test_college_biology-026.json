["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the genes that allow host bird species to be duped into rearing cuckoo fledglings. To answer this, we need to think about the ecological and evolutionary influences on parasite species assemblages. The documents mention that studies allowing evaluation of these two influences are comparative in nature and include data from a series of homogeneous samples of host populations. This suggests that the genes that allow host bird species to be duped into rearing cuckoo fledglings might be selected for because they provide some advantage to the host birds, such as increased reproductive success or reduced energy expenditure.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
