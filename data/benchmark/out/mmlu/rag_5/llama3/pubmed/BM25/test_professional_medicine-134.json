["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 15-year-old girl who has moved away from home more than a year ago and is living with a 28-year-old female cousin. She has a 6-month-old child and does not work or attend school. Since she is not married, it can be inferred that she is the sole caregiver for her child. Considering this situation, it is likely that the girl's parents are not involved in her life. Therefore, obtaining written consent from at least one of her parents (option D) is not a viable option. Additionally, accepting the girl's consent as sufficient (option A) may not be appropriate as she is a minor and requires legal guidance for medical evaluation. Obtaining a court order permitting evaluation (option B) would likely be an over-authorization and may not be necessary in this situation. Therefore, the most appropriate step prior to evaluating the patient's rectal problem would be to obtain written consent from at least two licensed physicians (option C), which is consistent with medical ethics and legal guidelines.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
