["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the process of translation. From the provided documents, we can see that translation requires exogenous mRNA (in the first document) and the presence of initiation factors such as IF-Malpha and IF-Mbeta (in the first document). Additionally, cell-free protein synthesis systems require the addition of exogenous messenger RNA (in the second document). The process of translation also requires active translation (in the third document). These documents suggest that mRNA is a crucial component of the translation process. Therefore, option A: mRNA, tRNA and ribosomes is the most likely correct answer.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
