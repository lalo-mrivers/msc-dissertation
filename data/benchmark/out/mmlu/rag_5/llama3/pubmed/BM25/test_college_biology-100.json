["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the provided documents, we can see that chloroplasts are found in plants and some algae, while mitochondria are found in all eukaryotes. The theory of serial endosymbiosis proposes that a primitive eukaryote took up bacteria to yield mitochondria and blue-green algae to yield chloroplasts. This suggests that mitochondria and chloroplasts have a common ancestor and are both found in plants, but not in animals. Fungi also do not have chloroplasts. Therefore, it can be concluded that plants have both chloroplasts and mitochondria; animals and fungi have only mitochondria.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
