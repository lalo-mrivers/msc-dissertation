["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided, we need to find the rate of energy expenditure given the mean rate of oxygen consumption. The first document 'Predicting metabolic cost of level walking' suggests that both step length and step rate must be used to predict the energy expenditure for any combination of step length and step rate. However, since we are dealing with a male athlete during a training session, we can use the information from the other documents to find the energy expenditure.\n\nThe document 'Oxygen cost and energy expenditure of running in trained runners' provides the oxygen consumption--running speed relationship which is highly significant (r = .917) and linear over the entire aerobic range. This information can be used to estimate the energy expenditure given the mean rate of oxygen consumption.\n\nThe document 'Basal metabolic rate and work energy expenditure of mature, pregnant women' provides information on the increase in energy cost of work paralleling the gain in body weight during pregnancy. However, since we are dealing with a male athlete during a training session, this information is not directly applicable.\n\nThe document 'Myocardial oxygen consumption of fibrillating ventricle in hypothermia' and 'Oxygen consumption during fire suppression: error of heart rate estimation' provide information on the relationship between oxygen consumption and energy expenditure. However, since we are dealing with a male athlete during a training session, these documents do not provide directly applicable information.\n\nBased on the above analysis, we can use the information from the document 'Oxygen cost and energy expenditure of running in trained runners' to estimate the rate of energy expenditure given the mean rate of oxygen consumption.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
