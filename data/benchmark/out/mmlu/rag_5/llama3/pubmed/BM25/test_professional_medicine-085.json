["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has poor pain control with codeine despite adherence to the analgesic regimen. The question does not specify if she took the medication every 4 hours as instructed. However, we can consider that her pain reduction was already low after taking the first dose of codeine (26% according to the provided study). Codeine is metabolized to morphine in the liver through CYP2D6 enzyme. The study suggests that blocking this metabolism with quinidine would not affect the analgesic effect of codeine. Therefore, it is unlikely that the therapeutic failure is due to decreased metabolism of codeine to morphine (B). Considering that other members of her family also experienced poor pain control with codeine, it is possible that there is an inherited deficiency or variation in CYP2D6 enzyme that affects its ability to metabolize codeine. This would lead to decreased effectiveness of the medication.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
