["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the function of osteoclasts as cells responsible for bone resorption. They have a ruffled border that is involved in the acidification of the microenvironment under which condition the bone matrix is dissolved. The mechanism of acid secretion by osteoclasts involves the provision of hydrogen ions by carbonic anhydrase II, and the proton pump of the vacuolar H+-ATPase type exists in the ruffled border membranes. Osteoclasts also have a chloride/bicarbonate exchanger that normalizes the intracellular pH when actively resorbing bone.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
