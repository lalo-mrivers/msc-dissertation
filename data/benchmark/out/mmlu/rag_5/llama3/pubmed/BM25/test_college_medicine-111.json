["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the volume of a gas at different atmospheric pressure. We are given that the gas occupies 0.1L at 200atm, which means we can use the ideal gas law to find its volume at other pressures. The ideal gas law states PV = nRT, where P is the pressure, V is the volume, n is the number of moles, R is the gas constant, and T is the temperature. Since we are given the volume at 200atm, we can use this to find the volume at other pressures.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B: 20L\""]
