["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks which of the given options are NOT characteristic of mammalian homeostasis. Based on the provided documents, Ascaridoidea evolutionary expansion in Mammals is discussed, but there is no direct mention of specific physiological processes like body temperature, blood glucose concentration, blood pH, or metabolic rate being regulated in mammals. The first document does not provide relevant information about these aspects. Similarly, the other three documents discuss various topics such as statistical models for intraindividual variation, mycotoxins, and X-chromosome inactivation, but do not explicitly mention mammalian homeostasis. Therefore, it can be inferred that mammals are homeostatic for all of the given options.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
