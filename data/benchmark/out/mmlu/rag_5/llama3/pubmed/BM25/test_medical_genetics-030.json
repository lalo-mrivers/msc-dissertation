["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, there is no direct information about δβ-thalassaemia. However, the question refers to mutational mechanisms. The closest relevant information is from the document 'Spontaneous mutagenesis in Escherichia coli strains lacking 6-methyladenine residues in their DNA: an altered mutational spectrum in dam- mutants.' This documents discusses different types of mutations such as transitions and frameshift mutagenesis. Given that δβ-thalassaemia is a type of haemoglobin disorder, it is likely that the question refers to point mutations.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
