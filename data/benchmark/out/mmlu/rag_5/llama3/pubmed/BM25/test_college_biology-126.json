["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about double fertilization, a process unique to flowering plants. The relevant information from the provided documents is about fertilization events in various organisms, including sea urchins, mammals, and newts. However, there is no mention of polar nuclei or endosperm formation. Therefore, we need to focus on the flowering plant process of double fertilization.

This suggests that the correct answer is related to endosperm development.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
