["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"After considering the documents, we know that glucose concentration declines to a low level after birth. This suggests that the decreasing glucose concentration can be explained as an adaptation of the steady state from a higher maternal level to a lower newborn level. In another document, it is mentioned that at birth there is a stop of the glucose supply via the umbilical cord. Given this information, we can assume that in the given scenario, the man's serum glucose concentration remains within the reference range due to adaptation and not because of continued gut absorption or other mechanisms.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
