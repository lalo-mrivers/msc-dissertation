["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 14-year-old girl who has started having sexual intercourse with various partners and is not using condoms or contraception. She had been doing well academically and extracurricularly before her parents' separation, but since then she has become rebellious and defiant. This suggests that the patient may be using some defense mechanism to cope with the stress and anxiety caused by her parents' separation.\n\nLooking at the options, acting out is a possible choice because the patient's behavior suggests a desire to assert her independence and rebellion against her parents' separation. However, it's not the most likely choice as the patient's behavior seems more focused on self-destructive tendencies rather than asserting her dominance.\n\nDisplacement is also possible but less likely because the patient's behavior doesn't seem to be related to any specific frustration or anxiety, unlike displacement which involves redirecting feelings towards an object or person that is safer or more acceptable.\n\nProjection is unlikely as there is no evidence of the patient attributing her own feelings or thoughts to someone else.\n\nReaction formation is possible but less likely because while the patient may be presenting a defiant and rebellious image, it's not clear if she is actually trying to hide a more vulnerable or submissive self. However, it's worth noting that reaction formation often involves hiding one's true feelings by adopting an opposite attitude, which doesn't necessarily fit with this patient's behavior.\n\nOverall, the most likely defense mechanism used by this patient is acting out, as her behavior suggests a desire for independence and rebellion against her parents' separation.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
