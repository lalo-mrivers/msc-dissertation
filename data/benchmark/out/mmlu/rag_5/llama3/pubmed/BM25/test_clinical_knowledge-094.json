["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents discuss oxygen saturation levels in different contexts. In the first document, a nomogram for determining arterial oxygen partial pressure at high altitudes is presented. The maximum value mentioned is 10,000 meters. At this altitude, the oxygen saturation level might be lower due to the decrease of oxygen partial pressure from the inspired air to the arterial blood. In the second and third documents, oxygen saturation levels are discussed in relation to chemical cyanosis and cardiac performance during intracardiac operations. Chemical cyanosis is characterized by an inverse linear relationship between methemoglobin levels and oxygen saturation levels. In the context of this condition, a level below 90% might be considered cyanosed. Considering these points, it is likely that a patient who is cyanosed has an oxygen saturation level below 90%. This information can be found in the Management of chemical cyanosis by oxygen saturation readings document.\", \"answer_choice\": C}"]
