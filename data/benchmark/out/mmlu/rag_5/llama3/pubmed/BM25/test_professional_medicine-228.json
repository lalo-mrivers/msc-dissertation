["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 45-year-old man with right shoulder pain after chopping wood. The examination shows no obvious bone deformities or point tenderness, but the pain is reproduced when externally rotating the shoulder against resistance. This suggests that the pain may be related to the teres minor muscle. The relevant documents suggest that simple chronic painful shoulder (scapulo-humeral periarthritis) is associated with lesions of the tendons of the short muscle teres of the shoulder, and that ruptures are more frequent in men after 65 years of age. However, the patient is only 45 years old, which makes a rupture less likely. A calcification of the tendons is more common between 30 to 65 years of age, but this information does not specifically relate to the teres minor muscle. Considering the electromyographic findings in competitive swimmers without shoulder pain, the subscapularis and serratus anterior muscles are active with constant muscle activity. However, this information does not provide direct evidence for inflammation of a specific tendon. Considering all these points, it is likely that the patient has inflammation of the teres minor tendon.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
