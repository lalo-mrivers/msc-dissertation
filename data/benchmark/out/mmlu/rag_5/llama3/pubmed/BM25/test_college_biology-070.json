["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about immunoglobulins with epsilon heavy chains located on the plasma membranes of mast cells and basophilic leukocytes. From the provided documents, we can see that IgE-binding protein (epsilon BP) is a galactoside-specific lectin containing an S-type carbohydrate-recognition domain. It was originally identified in rat basophilic leukemia cells and is now known to be identical to a macrophage surface Ag, Mac-2, and lectins designated as CBP 35/L-34/RL-29. Additionally, we can see that the IgE-binding protein is displayed on the cell surface in a manner that is reversible by lactose, most likely through attachment to yet unidentified glycoconjugates. This suggests that the immunoglobulins with epsilon heavy chains are indeed IgE.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
