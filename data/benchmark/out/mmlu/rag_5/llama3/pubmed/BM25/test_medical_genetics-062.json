["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to the study of DNA sequence variation, we can consider the region of the genome as conserved due to functional constraints. In this question, we are asked to calculate the likelihood of an individual carrying two specific alleles of a human DNA marker. The frequency of each allele is 0.2, which means it's present in 20% of the population. Since both alleles have the same frequency, we can assume that they are independent and equally likely to be present or absent. Therefore, the likelihood of an individual carrying two specific alleles of a human DNA marker will be the product of their frequencies: 0.2 x 0.2 = 0.04.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: 0.02\"\n}"]
