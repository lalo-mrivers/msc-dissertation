["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the thoracic cage, which was described as developing from the somitic mesoderm. The paper 'Role of the somitic mesoderm in the development of the rib cage of bird embryos' describes the origin of the sternal component and conditions for the development of the rib cage. It explains that only the somitic mesoderm of the prospective thoracic region (somites 19-26) is able to give rise to ribs. This suggests that the thoracic cage has a role in respiration, as it provides the structure for the lungs.\", \"answer_choice\": D}"]
