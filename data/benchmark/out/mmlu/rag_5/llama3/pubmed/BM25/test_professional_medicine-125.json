["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the management of mild bowlegs (10-degree genu varum) in a healthy 2-year-old girl. The first step is to look for potential causes of this condition. We need to consider the child's history and physical examination findings. Since the child was weaned at 6 months of age, this suggests that her diet has changed significantly since then. This information can help us rule out any nutritional deficiencies as a cause of her bowlegs. Furthermore, since she began walking at 10 months of age, her muscle development is likely to be normal.\n\nGiven these findings, it seems unlikely that the child's bowlegs are caused by any underlying medical condition or nutritional deficiency. Instead, they might be simply a normal variation in the growth and development of children. In this case, no treatment would be needed at this time.\", \"answer_choice\": D}"]
