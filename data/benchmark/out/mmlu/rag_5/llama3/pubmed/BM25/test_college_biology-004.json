["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the synthesis of an RNA/DNA hybrid from a single-stranded RNA template. This process is described in the documents provided. Specifically, it mentions the formation of a persistent hybrid between elongating RNA and template DNA, as well as the use of single-stranded DNA-binding protein to activate transcription on supercoiled templates. These mechanisms suggest that no primer or reverse transcriptase are required for this process.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
