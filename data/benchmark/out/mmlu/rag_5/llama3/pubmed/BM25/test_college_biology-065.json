["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe various aspects of the Golgi apparatus, such as its fragmentation in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, its role in processing and transport of plasma membrane, lysosomal, and secreted proteins, and the presence of specific enzymes within it. The Osmium Zinc Iodide staining of Golgi elements in oocytes shows that the organelle is involved in the formation of yolk and fusion with forming yolk platelets. In amoebae, the appearance of enzymic activity during the development of the Golgi apparatus was studied by cytochemical staining, showing that enzymes are present in the Golgi apparatus from its early stages of development. Finally, Low density lipoprotein receptor and cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor are transported from the cell surface to the Golgi apparatus at equal rates in PC12 cells.\n\nFrom these descriptions, we can infer that the Golgi apparatus is an organelle with multiple functions and a complex structure. It plays a role in processing and transport of proteins, participates in the formation of yolk, and is involved in enzymic activity.\n\nConsidering these points, option A seems to be the correct statement concerning the Golgi apparatus.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
