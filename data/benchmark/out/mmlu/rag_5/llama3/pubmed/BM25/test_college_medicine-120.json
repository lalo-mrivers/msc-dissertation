["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to the document 'Activity profile of competition soccer', high intensity running during a match was found to be correlated with blood lactate values. This suggests that blood lactate concentration does increase in response to high intensity exercise, such as sprinting or intense matches. In the second document 'Physiological responses to maximal intermittent exercise: differences between endurance-trained runners and games players', it is mentioned that peak blood lactate was significantly higher for games players compared to endurance-trained runners. This further supports the idea that blood lactate concentration increases in response to high intensity exercise, which would be typical in a soccer match. Therefore, we can conclude that the blood lactate concentration will likely increase during a game.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
