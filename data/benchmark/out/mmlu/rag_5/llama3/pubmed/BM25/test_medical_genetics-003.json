["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents provided discuss various aspects of DNA structure and interactions. One key point is the specific binding of cesium cations to AT pairs in the minor groove. Another document describes the sequence-specific interaction of the Salmonella Hin recombinase with T:A base pairs in the major groove and A:T contacts in the minor groove. Finally, a study on human chromosome replication shows that telomeric regions contain more GC-pairs than AT-pairs. Based on these points, it can be inferred that adenine typically pairs with thymine.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
