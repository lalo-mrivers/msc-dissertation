["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the provided documents, we can see that the mucosa of the hard palate has been described to have glandular tissue, particularly in the posterior half. This is mentioned in 'Distribution of glands in the mucosa of the hard palate and its relation to carcinoma'. Additionally, a cytochemical study on oral mucosa found large amounts of glycogen deposition in cells from the mouth floor and cheek, but very little or no glycogen in those from the mucosa of the hard palate. This suggests that the mucosa of the hard palate is non-keratinized. Furthermore, an immunohistochemical study on peptidergic nerve distribution found dense subepithelial plexuses in incisive papilla and transverse palatine ridges, which are features of the posterior half of the hard palate.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
