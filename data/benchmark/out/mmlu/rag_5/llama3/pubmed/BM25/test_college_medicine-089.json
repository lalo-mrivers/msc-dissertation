["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about Vygotsky's sociocultural development theory and the zone of proximal development. This concept refers to the range of knowledge that a child can learn with guidance from others but not on their own. The individual in this zone is still developing their skills and abilities, and they require support and scaffolding from more experienced individuals or technology to progress further. From the given documents, there are no direct connections to Vygotsky's theory or the concept of the zone of proximal development. However, we can look at the overall content and find some relevant information that might help us answer this question. The first document describes the development of the tibiotarsus in a chick embryo, which is not related to human cognitive development or Vygotsky's theory. The second document discusses morphology, specifically perforating cartilage canals, which also has no connection to the zone of proximal development. The third and fourth documents describe treatment programs for addictive behavior and limb-bud development, respectively, neither of which relates directly to the concept at hand. Finally, the fifth document explains the coronary collaterals' role in bypass surgery evaluations. None of these subjects are relevant to Vygotsky's sociocultural development theory or the zone of proximal development.\n\nIn light of this information, we can conclude that the question is not related to any specific scientific data provided. However, based on our understanding of Vygotsky's theory and its definition of the zone of proximal development, we can make an educated guess about what this concept entails. The individual in the zone of proximal development is someone who is still developing their skills or knowledge but requires guidance from others to progress further.\n\nLooking at the options provided, none of them seem directly related to Vygotsky's theory or the concept of the zone of proximal development. However, option D - A high diver takes instruction from her coach to improve her form on a specific move - seems like the most plausible choice. This situation fits with the definition of the zone of proximal development as it describes someone who is still developing their skills and requires guidance from others to progress further. Therefore, we can conclude that option D accurately describes an individual in the zone of proximal development.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
