["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the risk of miscarriage associated with amniocentesis. The relevant document for this question is 'Cytogenetic evidence for enhanced selective miscarriage of trisomy 21 pregnancies with advancing maternal age.' In this study, it was found that the frequency of chromosome abnormalities among women whose sole risk factor for a chromosome abnormality was advanced maternal age (â‰¥ 35 years old) increased with advancing maternal age. The study suggests that the miscarriage rate of trisomy 21 during the gestational interval studied is selectively greater with advancing maternal age. However, this study does not provide specific information about the risk of miscarriage associated with amniocentesis. Another relevant document, 'Prenatal diagnosis of genetic defects,' mentions that the risk of complications of amniocentesis is 0.5% to 1%. This suggests that the risk of miscarriage associated with amniocentesis is likely to be very low.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
