["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The problem is to find the complementary sequence of a given DNA strand. The first step is to identify the base pairing rules: A pairs with T and G pairs with C. Looking at the given DNA strand 5′ CGA TTG 3′, we can see that the sequence starts with 'C' which pairs with 'G'. Then comes 'G' which also pairs with 'C', followed by 'A' which pairs with 'T', then 'T' which pairs with 'A', and finally 'G' which pairs with 'C'. Based on these pairings, we can construct the complementary sequence.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
