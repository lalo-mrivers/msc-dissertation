["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has a history of atopic allergies and exercise-induced asthma. He is reporting increased symptoms over the past month, with wheezing and chest tightness that requires daily use of his albuterol inhaler. His peak expiratory flow rate is 240 L/min, which suggests mild airway obstruction but no severe disease. Given this information, it seems unlikely that a chest x-ray or initiation of corticosteroid therapy would be necessary at this point. Fexofenadine therapy is not directly related to the patient's current symptoms. Increasing use of albuterol inhaler could potentially mask underlying inflammation and worsen the condition over time. Therefore, the most appropriate management would involve monitoring his symptoms and adjusting as needed, possibly considering a trial of inhaled corticosteroids if symptoms persist or worsen.\", \"answer_choice\": D}"]
