["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, we can identify that none of the given options directly address the blood glucose concentration during 80-90 minutes of intermittent high intensity exercise. However, we can consider the effects of low blood glucose on plasma CRF, ACTH, and cortisol during prolonged physical exercise (Effect of low blood glucose on plasma CRF, ACTH, and cortisol during prolonged physical exercise). According to this document, when blood glucose concentrations decrease to less than 3.3 mM, plasma concentrations of CRF, ACTH, and cortisol show a significant increase. As the given exercise is intermittent high intensity, it might be possible that blood glucose concentration falls during periods of intense exercise.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
