["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking when maximal dynamic exercise becomes predominantly aerobic. The relevant document that provides information on this topic is 'The time course of phosphorylcreatine resynthesis during recovery of the quadriceps muscle in man.' According to this study, the immediate postexercise muscle PC content after exhaustive dynamic exercise was 15-16% of the resting muscle content, indicating an anaerobic contribution. The fast component of PC resynthesis had a half-time of 21-22s, which is consistent with an anaerobic process. It takes around 30 seconds for the anaerobic energy production to be depleted and aerobic energy production to become more prominent.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
