["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about a prokaryote that is thermophilic and methanogenic. The relevant documents mention Acholeplasma laidlawii as a small, cell-wall-less prokaryote that has more than 20 membrane acyl-proteins enriched in myristoyl and palmitoyl chains. Additionally, the document about diphytanyl and dibiphytanyl glycerol ether lipids of methanogenic archaebacteria suggests that these types of isopranyl ethers are found in extremely halophilic, thermoacidophilic bacteria, and also in methanogenic bacteria. This information implies that the thermophilic and methanogenic prokaryote could be an archaeon.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
