["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"After reading the relevant documents, I noticed that one of them (Palatal shelf elevation in the Wistar rat fetus) discusses the developmental ages of the fetuses. According to this document, palatal shelf elevation occurs at day 16.4 +/- 0.1. Since human prenatal development is similar to rat development, it can be inferred that the stage of palatal shelf elevation is around 16-17 days of embryonic development. This corresponds to around 6-7 weeks post-fertilization in humans.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A: six weeks post-fertilization.\""]
