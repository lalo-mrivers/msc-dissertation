["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To solve this problem, we can use the fact that the frequency of affected females is equal to the frequency of affected males multiplied by the ratio of female carriers to total individuals. Since the frequency of affected males is 0.10 (one in ten), the frequency of affected females will be 0.10 * (frequency of female carriers to total individuals). We know that for X-linked recessive conditions, the frequency of carrier females is equal to the frequency of affected males divided by the ratio of carrier females to carrier males. Since we are given a value of 0.10 for the frequency of affected males, we can plug this in and solve for the frequency of carrier females. Finally, we can multiply the frequency of carrier females by the ratio of female carriers to total individuals to find the expected frequency of affected females.\",\n\"answer_choice\": A"]
