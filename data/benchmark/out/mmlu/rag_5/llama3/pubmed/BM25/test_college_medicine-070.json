["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the synthesis of glycogen from various substrates. The first document mentions that the addition of glutamine, alanine, or asparagine stimulates the formation of glycogen from lactate 10- to 40-fold. This suggests that amino acids are involved in gluconeogenesis. Additionally, the second and third documents discuss the interaction between glucose or lipid and protein metabolism, which implies that amino acids can be used as substrates for glucose synthesis. Therefore, the synthesis of glucose from lactate, glycerol, or amino acids is likely due to gluconeogenesis.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
