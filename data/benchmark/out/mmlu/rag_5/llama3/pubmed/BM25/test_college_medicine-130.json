["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking why proteins are treated with a detergent (SDS) before being run through an electrophoresis gel. This suggests that the SDS serves as a denaturant, and the goal is to understand its role in the process. The relevant documents describe the use of SDS as a denaturing or 'unfolding' detergent, which allows for the separation of proteins based on their size rather than their native structure. This is supported by the description of protein structures in SDS micelle-protein complexes, where it is mentioned that SDS induces the formation of ordered structures (alpha-helix or beta-sheet) in certain peptides. Therefore, it can be concluded that the detergent serves to break the intramolecular bonds holding the tertiary and primary structure of the protein together, thereby generating linear fragments that may be sorted on size.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
