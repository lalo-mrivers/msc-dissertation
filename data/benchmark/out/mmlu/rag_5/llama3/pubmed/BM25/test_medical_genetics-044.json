["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the technique of PCR. The relevant documents describe PCR as a sensitive technique used to detect DNA of viral pathogens (Diagnosis of equid herpesviruses), and it is also mentioned as a simple, rapid, sensitive, specific and adaptable technique for water quality surveillance (Rapid detection of waterborne viruses). Additionally, PCR is described as a method that successfully amplifies the (CGG)n region in normal, carrier and affected individuals (Polymerase chain reaction analysis of fragile X mutations), and it can be used to generate full-length DNA sequences from apparently unsuccessful reactions by re-using the original primers (The use of hybrid-selected template increases the specificity of the polymerase chain reaction).\", \"answer_choice\": C}"]
