["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 14-year-old boy who has developed breast enlargement during the past year. Physical examination shows bilateral fibroglandular masses beneath the nipple-areolar complex and normal penis and testes. Pubic hair development is Tanner stage 3, which suggests that the patient is likely to be going through puberty. The patient's height and weight are at the 50th percentile, which further supports the diagnosis of pubertal breast enlargement. The hormone levels are within the reference ranges, which rules out endocrine disorders such as an estradiol-secreting Leydig cell tumor. Peutz-Jeghers syndrome is a rare genetic disorder that typically presents with mucocutaneous lesions and intestinal hamartomas, which is not consistent with this patient's symptoms. Seminiferous tubule dysgenesis (Klinefelter syndrome) would be expected to present with hypogonadism and gynecomastia, but the patient's hormone levels are normal. Therefore, the most likely cause of the patient's breast enlargement is normal development.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
