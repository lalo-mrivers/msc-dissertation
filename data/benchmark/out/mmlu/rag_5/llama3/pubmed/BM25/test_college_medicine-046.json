["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about a young child's behavior during an evaluation by a psychologist. The context is that the mother leaves for a short while and then returns. From this scenario, I consider what might be concerning signs of behavior from the child. One possibility is that the child might show distress or discomfort when the mother returns, indicating attachment issues. Another possibility is that the child might avoid the mother altogether, which could also suggest attachment problems. Finally, decreased exploration during the mother's absence could also be a concern, as it might indicate that the child relies too heavily on their mother for comfort and security. Among these possibilities, crying and returning to the mother upon return seems like the most concerning sign.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
