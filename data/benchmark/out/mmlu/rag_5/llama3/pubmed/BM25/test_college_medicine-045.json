["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The tricarboxylic acid cycle (Krebs' cycle) is a process by which the cell generates energy. It involves a series of enzyme-catalyzed reactions that ultimately result in the production of ATP and CO2. The key steps involved are the oxidation of acetyl-CoA, the reduction of NAD+, the formation of ATP from ADP and Pi, and the release of CO2. Each complete turn of the cycle results in the production of 2ATP and 2CO2.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B\n}"]
