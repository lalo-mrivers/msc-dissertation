["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks for an adaptation that would limit pollination by bees (Apis mellifera) and promote hummingbird pollination. Based on the provided documents, we know that bees are attracted to nectar with high sugar concentration produced in limited amounts. This suggests that if a plant produces nectar with low sugar concentration or in excess, it may be more likely to attract hummingbirds rather than bees. Therefore, an adaptation that would limit pollination by bees and promote hummingbird pollination is the production of nectar with low sugar concentration or in excess.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
