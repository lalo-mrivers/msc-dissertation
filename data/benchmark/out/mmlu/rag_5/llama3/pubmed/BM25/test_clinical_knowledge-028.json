["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents provide information on the physiological responses to maximal intermittent exercise. In one of the studies, blood lactate values were examined during a standardized multiple sprint test. The results showed that games players had higher peak blood lactate values than endurance-trained runners. This suggests that in high-intensity activities like soccer, blood lactate concentrations can increase significantly.\n\nAdditionally, an earlier study found a significant correlation between the amount of high-intensity running during a match and blood lactate concentration in the blood. This indicates that blood lactate concentration is influenced by the intensity and duration of physical activity.\n\nFurthermore, another study mentioned that there was no difference in regard to high-intensity activities between matches, suggesting that high-intensity running can be used for making comparisons in soccer.\n\nTherefore, based on these findings, it can be concluded that in games like soccer, blood lactate concentration increases significantly as the players become more fatigued.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
