["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents provided describe various aspects of embryonic development, including the mid-blastula transition (MBT), polarized membrane traffic in Xenopus laevis embryos, and the removal of Qa-2 antigen altering the Ped gene phenotype of preimplantation mouse embryos. None of these documents explicitly discuss yolk, telolecithal eggs, or meroblastic cleavage, so it's unlikely that the correct answer is related to these terms. Therefore, I will focus on the statements about embryonic cleavage.\n\nThe presence of yolk does not directly inhibit cleavage, as it is typically removed during oogenesis and early embryogenesis.\n\nTelolecithal eggs are characterized by a large yolk sac, but they do undergo cleavage (albeit meroblastic).\n\nThe vegetal pole in some organisms, such as Xenopus laevis, does undergo cleavage more readily than the animal pole. This is likely due to the differential regulation of gene expression and cell signaling pathways.\n\nFinally, the rapid mitotic divisions of cleavage directly give rise to blastomeres, which are the cells that make up the early embryo.\n\nIn conclusion, based on my analysis of the provided documents, the statement that 'The presence of yolk inhibits cleavage' is NOT true. Therefore, I believe that option A is the correct answer.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
