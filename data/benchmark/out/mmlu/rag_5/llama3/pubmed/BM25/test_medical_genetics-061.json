["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, we can see that ultrasound examination is used for prenatal diagnosis of various conditions including chromosome abnormalities. Documents [1] and [4] highlight the importance of ultrasound in diagnosing thrombosis and other venous flow issues, while document [2] shows the use of ultrasound in detecting growth retardation associated with Wiedemann-Rautenstrauch syndrome. Document [3] discusses the use of ultrasound in detecting triploidy. Document [5] highlights the value of early and subtle ultrasound examination in finding hints for chromosome abnormalities.\n\nIn this context, we can see that all options except D (Monozygotic twins) are related to fetal anomalies which could be associated with chromosome abnormalities. Therefore, option D would not raise suspicion of a chromosome abnormality.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
