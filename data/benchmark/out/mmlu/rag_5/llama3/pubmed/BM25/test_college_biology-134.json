["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The study introduces a molecular technique using restriction endonucleases to compare mtDNA sequences. The results indicate that there is detectable heterogeneity in mtDNA sequences within and among natural geographic populations of a species, and this heterogeneity can be used to estimate relatedness between individuals and populations. This suggests that geneticists use mtDNA to study the relatedness of animal populations because it provides a sensitive and powerful technique for reconstructing evolutionary relationships.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
