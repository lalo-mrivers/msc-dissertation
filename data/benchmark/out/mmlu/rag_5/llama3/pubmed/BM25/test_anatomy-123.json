["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking which bone has a process that joins with the zygomatic bone to form the zygomatic arch. From the provided documents, we know that the zygomatic fracture may result in depression of the zygomatic arch (Resorption of the zygomatic arch after elevation of a depressed fracture and subsequent osteomyelitis: report of case). The document 'The zygomatic arch and its possible influence on craniofacial growth and development' also mentions that surgical intervention on the zygomatic arch results in a generalized inhibition of regional zygomatic arch growth. This implies that the zygomatic arch is formed by the union of two bones. One of those bones is the temporal bone, which has a process (the temporal process) that joins with the zygomatic bone to form the zygomatic arch.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
