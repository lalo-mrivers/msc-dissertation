["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient had coronary angiography with stent placement 8 years ago. He reports shortness of breath and fatigue during exercise that began 3 months ago when he increased the distance of his daily walk from 1 mile to 3 miles. He has no new symptoms except for dyspnea and fatigue on exertion, which suggests that the patient may have a late hypotensive response to exercise, as seen in the study 'Clinical significance of early vs late hypotensive blood pressure response to treadmill exercise'. The patient's cardiac examination discloses a normal S1, pronounced S2, and a grade 2/6 late systolic murmur heard at the right upper parasternal border, which is consistent with a late hypotensive response. Therefore, the next step in management should be to order a transthoracic echocardiography (D) to assess cardiac function and rule out other causes of dyspnea.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
