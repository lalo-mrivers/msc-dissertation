["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe cases of exon skipping due to various mutations. In the first document, short internal exons are ignored by splicing machinery when the pyrimidine content of the polypyrimidine tract in the upstream intron is low. This suggests that the sequence elements in pre-mRNA control the outcome of each splicing event. In the second and third documents, exon skipping is caused by mutations at the 5' splice site or within the exon itself. The fourth document describes a case where exon skipping occurs due to inefficient late polyadenylation signals. These cases suggest that exon skipping can be associated with various types of mutations.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C\n}"]
