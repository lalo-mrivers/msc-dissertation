["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, we can identify that hyperammonemia is associated with increased brain extracellular fluid (ECF) amino acid levels, elevated brain ECF aromatic amino acids, and reduced arterial blood branched chain amino acids. Additionally, local intracerebral ammonia infusion elevates glutamate levels in cerebral ECF, suggesting an excitatory effect on the brain. This information suggests that a high blood ammonia level is likely related to hyperammonemia.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
