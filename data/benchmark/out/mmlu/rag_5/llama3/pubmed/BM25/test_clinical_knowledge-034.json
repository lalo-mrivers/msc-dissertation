["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about kinase reactions. The provided documents mention kinases, such as protein kinase C (PKC) and double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase. From the document 'Competitive effect of anti-HLA class I monoclonal antibody (01.65) and N-N-staurosporine on prolipherative response of PHA activated T-lymphocytes', we know that PKC is involved in the reaction and it can be studied as a cytosolic or particulate enzyme. The document 'Cytosolic double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase' describes two forms of this enzyme, one being anionic and the other cationic. Based on this information, it seems that kinases are involved in the addition or removal of phosphate groups (phosphorylation).\", \"answer_choice\": B}"]
