["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking what determines metabolism. Metabolism refers to the process by which our cells turn food into energy. Based on the provided documents, I see that metabolism can occur through different pathways such as O-methylation (Metabolism of 5-S-cysteinyldopa by O-methylation), aryl-sulphatase activity (Arylsulfatase activity in the pineal body), and degradation of phenol and resorcinol (Metabolism of phenol and resorcinol in Trichosporon cutaneum). These processes are controlled by enzymes, which are proteins formed as dictated by the genetic material. Therefore, metabolism is determined by the proteins formed as dictated by the genetic material.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
