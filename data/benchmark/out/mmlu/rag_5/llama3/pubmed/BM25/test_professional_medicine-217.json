["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the mechanism that would increase this patient's blood pressure further. Given his current blood pressure of 165/95 mm Hg, we need to look at factors that could contribute to increased peripheral vascular resistance. The documents suggest that increased tissue pressure within a closed compartment can lead to inadequate perfusion and relative ischemia when the tissue pressure equals or exceeds the patient's diastolic blood pressure. Therefore, it is likely that increased peripheral vascular resistance would further increase this patient's blood pressure.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
