["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the sensitivity of a new blood test for detecting prostate cancer. The test result is positive if the serum prostate-specific antigen concentration is greater than 5 ng/mL. Therefore, we need to know how many people with prostate cancer have a positive test result (true positives). This information can be obtained from the number of men who undergo biopsy procedures and are found to have prostate cancer (90 out of 100). We also need to know how many people without prostate cancer (false positives) have a positive test result. This information is not provided in the question, but it would be necessary to calculate the sensitivity.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
