["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the duration of exercise that can be sustained by the energy released from the breakdown of high-energy phosphates ATP and phosphocreatine. According to the first document 'Metabolic and respiratory parameters during muscular exercise in man', muscle ATP stores cannot provide more than 1 or 2 kcal of muscular work, which means that this energy source is limited. The second document 'Role of lipids on endurance capacity in man' mentions that the rate of release from adipose tissue is regulated by hormonal and nervous influence, but it also states that hydrolysis of triglyceride is not the only fuel for exercise.
