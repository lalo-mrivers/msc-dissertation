["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe different types of cell divisions and their symmetries. In the first document, it talks about the primary structure of collagen fibers and its relation to the projection of polar amino acid residues onto the axis of the microfibril. The concept of oblique angles is not explicitly mentioned in this document. However, it does mention the staggering of neighboring molecules, which might be related to oblique angles. In the second document, it describes the cleavage patterns during molluscan embryogenesis and how they lead to bilateral symmetry. The cleavages are mentioned as being unequal and giving rise to minor differences between quadrants. The size difference between macromeres predisposes one of them to become induced to develop the stem cell of mesoderm. There is no explicit mention of oblique angles or spiral cleavage in this document. In the third document, it compares cube rotations around inclined axes relative to the environment and the cube. This does not seem relevant to the question about early cell divisions. The fourth document describes a technique for treating hallux valgus by oblique osteotomy of the first metatarsal. There is no mention of cell divisions or their symmetries in this document.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
