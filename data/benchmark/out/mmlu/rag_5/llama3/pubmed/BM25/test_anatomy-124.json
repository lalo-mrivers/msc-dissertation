["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the given documents, I can identify that parasympathetic preganglionic axons are related to the sacral outflow. Specifically, document 1 mentions that 'electrical stimulation of acutely or chronically transected ('deafferented') sacral ventral roots depressed spontaneous bladder contractions and the firing of sacral parasympathetic preganglionic neurones innervating the bladder.'
