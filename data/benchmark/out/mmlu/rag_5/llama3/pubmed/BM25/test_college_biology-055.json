["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, we need to understand what the gray crescent is. It's a structure that contains the germ plasm, which is essential for the development of certain cells, including primordial germ cells (p.p. germ cells). In amphibian zygotes, the germ plasm is partitioned between the first four blastomeres by the first two cleavage planes. Since only one blastomere has the gray crescent in this experiment, it will contain all the germ plasm. This means that this blastomere will have a higher likelihood of developing into cells with germ plasm.\n\nNext, we can look at the fate of the p.p. germ cells during cleavage. In Xenopus laevis, the p.p. germ cells divide twice between early gastrula and the stage at which they leave the endoderm. This means that the blastomere with the gray crescent will have a higher likelihood of developing into a complete embryo.\n\nFinally, we can consider the role of the gray crescent in determining the fate of the blastomere. In the experiment described above, the two blastomeres were separated after the first cleavage. This means that one blastomere will contain all the germ plasm and the other will not. Based on our understanding of the role of the gray crescent in development, we can predict that the blastomere with the gray crescent will have a higher likelihood of developing into a complete embryo.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
