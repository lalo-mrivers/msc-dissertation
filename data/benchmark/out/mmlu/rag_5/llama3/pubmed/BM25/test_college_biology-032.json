["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the habitat utilization of a bird species that can nest in treetops or on cliff ledges but chooses to only nest in treetops due to the presence of another aggressive bird species on the cliff ledges. This suggests that the birds are adapting to their environment and making a choice based on predation pressure. The fundamental niche refers to the range of conditions under which a species can survive, while the realistic niche is the portion of the fundamental niche actually occupied by the species due to biotic or abiotic factors. Since the birds are choosing to nest in treetops despite being capable of nesting in both treetops and cliff ledges, it suggests that they are utilizing neither their fundamental nor realistic niche.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
