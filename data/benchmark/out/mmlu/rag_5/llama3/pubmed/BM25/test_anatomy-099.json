["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the expected finding of an enlarged submandibular salivary gland. The relevant documents mention reactions of the rat submandibular salivary gland to injury of the contralateral gland, which does not provide information on the size or location of the gland. The other documents discuss different topics such as minimization of postsurgical scars, treatment of a traumatic fistula of the submandibular gland, and recognition of obsessive-compulsive disorder. However, one document discusses Kimura disease involving parotid gland and cervical nodes, which mentions that the majority of lesions occur in the head and neck.

Therefore, it is likely that the enlarged submandibular salivary gland would be palpable both intra- and extraorally.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
