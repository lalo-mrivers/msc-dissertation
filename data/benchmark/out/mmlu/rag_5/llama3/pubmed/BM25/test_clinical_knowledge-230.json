["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents suggest that pharmacological agents can influence the central nervous system by interacting with neurotransmitters. In 'Interaction of psychotropic agents with central neurotransmitters as revealed by their effects on PGO waves in the cat', tricyclic antidepressants depress PGO waves by inhibiting the neuronal uptake of norepinephrine (NE) and/or 5-hydroxy-tryptamine (5-HT). This implies that NE and 5-HT are involved in fatigue development. In 'Biochemistry and pharmacology of lipid antioxidants in acute brain and spinal cord injury', antioxidant compounds were shown to have neuroprotective efficacy, which suggests that oxidative stress may be related to fatigue development.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
