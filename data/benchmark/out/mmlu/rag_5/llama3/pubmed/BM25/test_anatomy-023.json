["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Gastrulation is a process that involves the morphogenetic movements of gastrulation, which are highly conserved in a wide variety of organisms. The original eukaryotic cell may have possessed the key processes necessary for metazoan development--cell differentiation, patterning and motility--and these are present in the cell cycle. In the context of sea urchin eggs, tunicamycin inhibits gastrulation, while 2-deoxy-D-glucose induces hyperdevelopment of ectodermic structures.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
