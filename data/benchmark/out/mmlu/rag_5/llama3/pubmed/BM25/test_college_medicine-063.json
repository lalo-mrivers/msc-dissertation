["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the phases common to cells undergoing meiosis and mitosis. Meiosis and mitosis both involve cell division, but they differ in their purpose (meiosis is for sexual reproduction, while mitosis is for growth and repair). Both processes have G2 phase, where the DNA is replicated before the cell divides. S phase is also present in both processes, as it's where the DNA replication occurs. Meiosis does not involve G0 phase.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C: II and III only\""]
