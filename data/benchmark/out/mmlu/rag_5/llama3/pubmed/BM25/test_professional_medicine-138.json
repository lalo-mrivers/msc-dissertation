["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with three flesh-colored lesions on the shaft of his penis that are non-tender. The lesions turn white upon application of acetic acid. Given this presentation, the most likely diagnosis is condylomata acuminata (genital warts). Since the patient is sexually active and uses condoms inconsistently, it's possible he has contracted a sexually transmitted infection. Acyclovir therapy is not indicated as genital warts are caused by human papillomavirus, not herpes simplex virus. Doxycycline therapy may be effective against chlamydia or ureaplasma but would not treat genital warts. Penicillin therapy is also not indicated as penicillin is effective against bacterial infections, not viral infections like genital warts. Cryotherapy can be used to treat genital warts.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
