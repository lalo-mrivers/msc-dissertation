["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the presence of two or more cell lines from different zygotes in a single individual. The relevant documents provided are about yeast mitochondrial inheritance, human IVF triploidy, mouse zygote inhibition, rat glioma collagen synthesis, and glucocorticoid-treated hepatocytes.
