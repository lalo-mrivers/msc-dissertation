["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant document for this question is 'Skeletal muscle energy metabolism and fatigue during intense exercise in man.' During intense exercise, the muscle store of ATP will be depleted in < 1s. To maintain normal contractile function, ATP must be continually resynthesized. The text states that during near maximal intense exercise, ATP is achieved principally by the oxidation of carbohydrate and the anaerobic utilization of phosphocreatine (PCr) and carbohydrate. Therefore, the most rapid method to resynthesize ATP during exercise is through the anaerobic utilization of PCr.\", \"answer_choice\": B}"]
