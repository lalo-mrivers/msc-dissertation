["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has atrial fibrillation with rapid heart rate, which is not responding to metoprolol. We need to consider medications that can help slow down the pulse. Digoxin is often used to control ventricular response in atrial fibrillation, but it may take some time to work. Enalapril is an ACE inhibitor and may not be effective in controlling heart rate. Lidocaine can be used for cardiac arrhythmias, including atrial fibrillation, but its effects on pulse are short-lasting.
