["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents provided information about the effects of hydrogen ions on various biological processes. In one study, it was found that lactate and hydrogen ions leave the muscle through different mechanisms. The rate of efflux of hydrogen ions exceeded that of lactate ions by a significant factor. This suggests that there may be a specific mechanism for the transport of hydrogen ions out of the muscle.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
