["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient had a total thyroidectomy and excision of enlarged left jugular lymph nodes for follicular carcinoma. He is receiving intravenous 5% dextrose and 0.45% saline with potassium. Twelve hours after the operation he develops circumoral numbness and paresthesias in his fingertips, and he becomes very anxious. Vital signs are normal.

This is supported by the patient's symptoms of circumoral numbness and paresthesias.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
