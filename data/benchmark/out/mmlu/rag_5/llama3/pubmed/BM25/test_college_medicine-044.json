["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The DNA polymerase creates new DNA by adding complementary nucleotides to a template strand from the original double-stranded DNA. In this case, we have a section of the template strand with a ratio of 3:2 of A:T bases. To find the ratio of A:T in the newly synthesized complimentary strand of DNA, we need to consider that the DNA polymerase adds complementary nucleotides to the template strand. Therefore, if the template strand has a ratio of 3:2 of A:T bases, then the newly synthesized complimentary strand will have a ratio of 2:3 of T:A bases.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
