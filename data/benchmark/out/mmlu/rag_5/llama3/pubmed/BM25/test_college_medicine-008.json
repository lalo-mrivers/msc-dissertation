["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the process of translation. From the given documents, we know that translation requires the presence of exogenous mRNA (The purification and properties of two low-molecular-weight proteins required for the initiation of translation in ascites tumour cells.). We also know that ribosomes are involved in protein synthesis (Cell-free protein synthesis in lysates of Drosophila melanogaster cells.). However, DNA is not directly involved in the process of translation. RNA polymerase is not mentioned as a requirement for translation in any of the given documents. Therefore, we can conclude that mRNA and ribosomes are required for translation.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
