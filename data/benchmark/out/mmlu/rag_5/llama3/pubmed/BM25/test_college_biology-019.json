["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the biome with the highest rate of leaching and cycling of nutrients. The documents provided don't explicitly mention the biomes listed in the options, but they do discuss soil types and their properties. From the document 'Movement and persistence of aldicarb in certain soils', we can see that some leaching was detected in coarse sand, whereas leaching was limited in clay loam and muck soils. This suggests that sandy soils might have a higher rate of leaching. However, this doesn't directly relate to biomes.\n\nThe document 'Supply of trace elements to ruminants in the German Democratic Republic' discusses the geological origin of soils and its effect on zinc concentrations. It mentions different types of soil, including loamy soils, weathered soils, basalt, shell limestone, Keuper, red sandstone, and sandy diluvial soils.\n\nConsidering these documents, it's not possible to pinpoint a specific biome with the highest rate of leaching and cycling of nutrients based on the provided information. However, we can infer that sandy or loamy soils might be more prone to leaching, which could potentially occur in biomes like deserts or tropical rainforests.\", \"answer_choice\": D}"]
