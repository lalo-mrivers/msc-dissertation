["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the factors that promote glucose and amino acid uptake by muscle. One of the documents provided is 'Influence of insulin on amino acid uptake by lung slices'. This document shows that insulin increases the uptake of amino acids, specifically alpha-aminoisobutyric acid ([14C]AIB). Therefore, it can be concluded that insulin promotes amino acid uptake. Additionally, another document is 'Local effect of burn injury on glucose and amino acid metabolism by skeletal muscle'. This document shows that there is a difference in glucose metabolism by skeletal muscles from the burned versus unburned regions of the body, and soleus from the burned limb took up 125% more glucose than those from the unburned limb. Therefore, it can be concluded that glucose uptake is enhanced in muscle from the burned region. Since there is no direct information on the effects of adrenaline, glycogen, or cortisol on glucose and amino acid uptake by muscle, these options cannot be supported by the provided documents.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
