["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about proprioceptive nerve endings in synovial joints. From the documents provided, we can see that proprioception is related to joint movement and positioning. The document 'Innervation of the synovial membrane of the cats joint capsule' mentions the occurrence of Pacinian corpuscles with an inner core in the border zone between the stratum synoviale and fibrosum. These corpuscles are responsible for detecting vibrations and movements, which is related to proprioception. Therefore, we can conclude that proprioceptive nerve endings are located in the articular cartilage and synovial membrane.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
