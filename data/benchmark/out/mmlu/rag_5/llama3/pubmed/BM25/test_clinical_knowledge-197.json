["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking which of the options is not necessary when examining the jugular venous pulse. The relevant document describes various methods for examining the jugular venous valve and pressure gradients. The study uses endoscopic visualization, ultrasound techniques, and transvalvular pressure gradients to measure competence of the jugular venous valve. This suggests that good lighting may not be crucial in this examination method. Option C: Good lighting is therefore not necessary when examining the jugular venous pulse.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"]
