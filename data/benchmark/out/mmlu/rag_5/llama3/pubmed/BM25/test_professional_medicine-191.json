["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the sympathetic innervation for the viscera involved in this patient's condition. The symptoms described are loose stools alternating with constipation, which suggests a possible gastrointestinal issue. The relevant documents provided mention nothing about gut innervation. However, we can consider other possibilities. The patient has abdominal tenderness, which could be related to the viscera. The sympathetic nervous system is involved in controlling gut motility and secretion. Based on the symptoms, it's unlikely that the issue is with the upper gastrointestinal tract (which would be controlled by C1-C2). The lower part of the gut is innervated by T7-L2, which includes the thoracic and lumbar sympathetic ganglia.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"]
