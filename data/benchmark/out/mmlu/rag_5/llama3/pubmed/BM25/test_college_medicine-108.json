["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about a fundamental cause of fatigue in high intensity exercise. From the provided documents, we know that energetic deficiency plays a major role in the aetiology of muscle fatigue. This suggests that a reduced capacity to generate ATP and increased catabolism of the adenine nucleotide pool in the muscle fibre may be a common metabolic denominator at fatigue. Additionally, transient increases in ADP are suggested to occur during energetic deficiency and may be the cause of fatigue.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
