["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The pupillary light reflex is conveyed by slow (less than 10 m/sec) optic tract fibres which synapse in the medial part of the pretectal area. In turn, pretectal neurones with conduction velocities of about 6 m/sec pass to the Edinger-Westphal complex from which the preganglionic 'pupilloconstrictor' neurones originate.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
