["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the provided documents, it is clear that the hypothalamus plays a crucial role in controlling the stress response by releasing CRF. This leads to the eventual release of cortisol systemically. Cortisol has a negative feedback effect on the pituitary gland, suppressing further release of ACTH and subsequently CRF. This mechanism is mentioned in the section 'The relative importance of hypothalamic neurons containing corticotropin-releasing factor or vasopressin in the regulation of adrenocorticotropic hormone secretion.'
