["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the 23-year-old woman's carrier status for Duchenne muscular dystrophy. The patient's brother and maternal uncle had DMD and died at ages 28 and 17 years, respectively. Serum studies show a muscle creatine kinase concentration of 120 U/L, which is within the normal range (22-198). However, the patient's mother has a serum muscle creatine kinase concentration of 300 U/L, which is elevated. This suggests that the patient may be a carrier of DMD. The family history also supports this possibility. Therefore, based on the given information, it can be concluded that the patient is likely a carrier of DMD.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
