["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"After reviewing the provided documents, I did not find any information about DiGeorge/Shprintzen syndrome. However, based on the description of Langer-Giedion syndrome (LGS) and Angelman syndrome, I noticed that both syndromes are caused by deletions in specific regions of certain chromosomes. LGS is caused by a deletion in 8q24.1, while Angelman syndrome is caused by a deletion in 15q11q13. Given the pattern of syndromes being caused by deletions in specific chromosomal regions, I will analyze the potential choices to find a match for DiGeorge/Shprintzen syndrome.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
