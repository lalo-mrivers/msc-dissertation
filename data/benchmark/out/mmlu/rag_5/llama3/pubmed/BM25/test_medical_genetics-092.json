["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the provided documents, we can see that most new mutations are either neutral or deleterious. The first document talks about temperature-sensitive respiratory-deficient mitochondrial mutants which may represent new loci, among which some are probably mutations of tRNA and rRNA genes. This suggests that many mutations are not beneficial. The second document discusses super-unstable mutations in Drosophila melanogaster which can be irreversible or form paired alleles. This does not suggest a bias towards beneficial mutations. The third document talks about Escherichia coli mutants blocked in production of membrane-derived oligosaccharides and finds that the mutations mapped to two genetic loci, suggesting a lack of selective pressure for beneficial mutations. Finally, the fourth and fifth documents discuss circadian rhythm mutants and antibody response mutants respectively, both of which suggest that many new mutations are not beneficial.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
