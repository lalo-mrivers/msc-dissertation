["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking which technique could be used to demonstrate protein binding to specific DNA sequences. In the provided documents, techniques such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assisted binding site selection method, sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, high pressure liquid chromatography, and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis were used to study protein-DNA interactions. The technique that stands out as a potential candidate for demonstrating protein binding to specific DNA sequences is the Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). EMSA is a widely used technique in molecular biology that measures the ability of proteins to bind to specific DNA sequences by analyzing the migration pattern of labeled DNA-protein complexes on an agarose or polyacrylamide gel. The other options, Western blot hybridization, Northern blot hybridization, and Southern blot hybridization, are techniques used for studying protein expression, RNA expression, and DNA sequence analysis respectively, but they do not directly measure protein-DNA interactions.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
