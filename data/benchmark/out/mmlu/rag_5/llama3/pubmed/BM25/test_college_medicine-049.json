["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To solve this problem, we need to balance the reaction first. The given reaction is unbalanced, so let's add oxygen molecules on both sides until it's balanced. This will give us:\n\nC2H4 + 3O2 â€”> 2CO2 + 2H2O\n\nNow, let's find out how many grams of carbon dioxide would be produced if we provide the reaction with 84g of ethane.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the number of moles of ethane:\n\nmoles of C2H4 = mass of C2H4 / molar mass of C2H4\n= 84g / (30.07 g/mol)\n= approximately 2.8 mol\n\nSince the reaction is balanced, the number of moles of oxygen should be equal to three times the number of moles of ethane.\n\nmoles of O2 = 3 x 2.8 mol\n= approximately 8.4 mol\n\nNow, let's calculate the number of moles of carbon dioxide:\n\nmoles of CO2 = 1/2 x moles of C2H4\n= 1/2 x 2.8 mol\n= approximately 1.4 mol\n\nFinally, we can calculate the mass of carbon dioxide produced:\n\nmass of CO2 = moles of CO2 x molar mass of CO2\n= 1.4 mol x (44 g/mol)\n= approximately 61.6g\n\nThis means that if a reaction was provided with 84g of ethane and unlimited oxygen, we would produce around 61.6g of carbon dioxide.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C: 264g is not correct because the calculation above shows that only approximately 61.6g of carbon dioxide will be produced. The other options are also incorrect.\""]
