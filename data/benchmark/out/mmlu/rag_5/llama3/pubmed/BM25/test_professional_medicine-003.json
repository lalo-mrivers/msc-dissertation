["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 9-year-old boy who has immigrated to the US with his family. He has a grade 3/6 systolic murmur audible along the left sternal border at the third and fourth intercostal spaces, indicating a possible cardiac anomaly. The chest xray shows mild cardiomegaly with left ventricular prominence, which suggests that the patient may have left ventricular hypertrophy. The ECG also confirms this finding. Considering these findings, the most likely diagnosis is anomalous origin of the left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery (ALCP). This condition is more common in adults, but it can also occur in children.\n\nThe patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with ALCP, which can cause a systolic murmur along the left sternal border. The mild cardiomegaly on chest xray may be due to ventricular hypertrophy or congestive heart failure. The ECG finding of left ventricular hypertrophy further supports this diagnosis.\n\nGiven that ALCP is a condition associated with an increased risk of ischemic progression, it is likely that the patient is at greatest risk for which of the following complications:\",\n\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
