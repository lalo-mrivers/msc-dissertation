["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about anaerobic metabolism. The relevant documents are about different enzymes and their activities. ATP: L-methionine-S-adenosyltransferase is an enzyme that is involved in the biosynthesis of polyphosphates, while polyphosphate phosphotransferase and polyphosphatase are enzymes that are involved in the degradation of polyphosphates. There is no information about ADP, glycogen, or oxygen in these documents. Therefore, it can be concluded that anaerobic metabolism refers to the generation of ATP without the use of oxygen.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
