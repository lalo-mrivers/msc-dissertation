["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the rate of blood lactate accumulation. The relevant document is 'Rapid kinetic measurement of lactate in plasma with a centrifugal analyzer.' This method measures the rate of increase in absorbance of NADH formed, which is proportional to lactate concentration. Therefore, the rate of blood lactate accumulation is determined by the rate of muscle lactate production and the rate of muscle lactate efflux.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
