["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the effect of gene flow between populations. From the provided documents, it can be inferred that high levels of gene flow were observed among populations within a species and even among different species in the Ipomopsis aggregata complex. This suggests that gene flow does not lead to an increase in genetic homogeneity, as high gene flow is still maintained. Additionally, there is no evidence suggesting that gene flow leads to an increase in the rate of deleterious mutations or disrupts Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Therefore, it can be concluded that gene flow between populations results in...\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
