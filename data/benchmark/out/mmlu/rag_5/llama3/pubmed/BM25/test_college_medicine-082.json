["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking which variables are dependent variables in this experiment. A dependent variable is a factor that is being measured or observed in response to some experimental manipulation. In this case, the psychologist is manipulating the amount of compensation ($10 vs $20), the time allowed for learning (15 minutes vs 30 minutes), and the environment for recall (same room vs different setting). The variable that the experiment is trying to measure or observe is the number of facts the subjects can recall. Therefore, III is the dependent variable.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B: III only\"\n}"]
