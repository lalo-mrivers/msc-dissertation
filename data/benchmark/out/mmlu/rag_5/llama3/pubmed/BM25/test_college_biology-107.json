["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to the documents, electron transport chain associated with photosystem I is mentioned in the context of temperature effects on light-induced electron transport between two photosystems. Redox transients of P700 in bean chloroplasts induced by far-red continuous light and brief flashes (t1/2 = 7 musec) of white light were studied under various temperatures. It has been shown that light-induced electron transport between two photosystems occurs at temperatures from -5 degrees to 45 degrees. At temperature interval 5 divided by 30 degrees photosystem 2 donates electrons to P700+ in response to the flash with the maximum efficiency.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
