["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"In this cross between a tall violet plant (DDWw) and a dwarf white plant, we need to consider the genotype of each parent. The F1 progeny will inherit one allele for height (D or d) from each parent. As D is dominant over d, all F1 progeny will be tall. For flower color, the W allele is dominant over w, so all F1 progeny will have violet flowers. Therefore, we expect a phenotypic ratio of all tall and violet.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A: All tall violet\""]
