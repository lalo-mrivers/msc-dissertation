["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks which of the following can act as an intracellular buffer to limit pH changes when the rate of glycolysis is high. From the provided documents, we know that glycolysis is influenced mainly by the intracellular pH rather than by the pH of the suspending medium. This suggests that a substance that can regulate intracellular pH would be suitable for this question. In one of the documents, it mentions that non-electrolytes or anions stimulate glycolytic rate by elevation of intracellular pH. Carnosine is an anion and is known to have buffering properties. Therefore, it is likely that carnosine can act as an intracellular buffer to limit pH changes when the rate of glycolysis is high.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
