["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the initial energy source for very high force contractions lasting 1-2 seconds. From the provided documents, we can see that during isometric exercise, VO2 increases initially to 200% of the controls and then levels off later at 150%. This suggests that the initial energy source is from anaerobic sources such as phosphocreatine stores or glycogen breakdown.\n\nThe document on voluntary discharge frequencies of human motoneurons also supports this idea, stating that the ability to activate the muscle fully by voluntary effort was confirmed by twitch interpolation. This implies that the muscle uses its phosphocreatine stores to generate force initially, and only later does it switch to aerobic metabolism.\n\nFinally, the document on cardiac heat production states that little or no temporal distinction exists between initial (anaerobic) and recovery (oxidative) metabolism in cardiac muscle. Similarly, during high-force contractions lasting 1-2 seconds, it is likely that the initial energy source is from anaerobic sources such as phosphocreatine stores or glycogen breakdown.\n\nTherefore, the answer to this question is likely to be one of the options A, C, or D.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C: phosphocreatine stores.\""]
