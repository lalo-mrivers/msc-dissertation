["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the trigger mechanism that initiates the contractile process in skeletal muscle. According to the documents provided, cardiac TnC site 1 is actively engaged in the trigger mechanism and dominates the phenotype despite its inability to chelate Ca2+. In skeletal TnC, sites 1 and 2 are both essential for the trigger mechanism of the contraction switch. Therefore, calcium binding to troponin (D) is the most likely answer.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
