["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about a substance that binds to cytochrome oxidase A3. Since cytochrome oxidase A3 is the final enzyme in the electron transport chain, this means it's the terminal oxidase. This suggests that the substance could be inhibiting the transfer of electrons to oxygen. In human cells, aerobic respiration is crucial for energy production. If this process is blocked, the cell would not be able to produce ATP through aerobic respiration.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A: Lead to death due to an inability of the cell to pass electrons to oxygen, thus stopping aerobic respiration and asphyxiating the cells.\""]
