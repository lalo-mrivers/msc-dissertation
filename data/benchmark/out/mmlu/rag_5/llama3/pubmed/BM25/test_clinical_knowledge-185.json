["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, it is mentioned that somatic cell hybrids between mouse peritoneal macrophages and HT-1080 human fibrosarcoma cells lose mouse chromosomes and retain the entire complement of human chromosomes. This suggests that human somatic cells contain a complete set of 23 chromosomes. Additionally, in situ hybridization of human somatic cell chromosomes suggests that the genes coding for 28S and 18S RNA's are located in the satellite of acrocentric chromosomes rather than in the secondary constriction, which is consistent with the notion of a complete set of 23 chromosomes.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C\n}"]
