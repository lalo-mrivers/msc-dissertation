["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Phalloidin is a toxin that binds to actin subunits and disrupts actin function. The relevant documents highlight the dissociation of phalloidin-actin complex, where phalloidin reduces the critical concentration for depolymerization of rabbit muscle actin. This indicates that phalloidin interacts with actin filaments directly.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C: Microfilaments\"\n}"]
