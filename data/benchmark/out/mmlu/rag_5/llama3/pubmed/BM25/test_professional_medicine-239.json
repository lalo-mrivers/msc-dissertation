["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has a history of hypertension and coronary artery disease. The blood pressure has progressively declined since the operation, with vital signs showing temperature 35.8°C (96.4°F), pulse 130/min, respirations 20/min, and blood pressure 80/50 mm Hg. The hematocrit is 30%, which is lower than preoperative levels of 41%. The patient has received 4 L of intravenous crystalloid in the recovery room. The reported operative blood loss was 200 mL. Drainage from the nasogastric tube is clear.\n\nConsidering these findings, the most likely cause of hypotension and decreased urine output is bleeding due to damage to a major blood vessel. Among the options, the epigastric artery or middle colic artery are more plausible explanations compared to liver or spleen damage.\", \n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
