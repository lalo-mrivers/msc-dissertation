["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the effect of sodium bicarbonate ingestion on middle distance running performance. The relevant study is 'Sodium bicarbonate ingestion and its effects on anaerobic exercise of various durations'. According to this study, sodium bicarbonate has no ergogenic benefit for work periods of 10 or 30 s duration, but it does improve performance for work periods of 120 and 240 s duration. This suggests that the mechanism of action is related to the buffering capacity of the extracellular fluid during longer periods of high-intensity exercise.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
