["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The problem is about the frequency of AABBCC individuals resulting from a mating between two AaBbCc individuals. Since it's a recessive gene, we need to consider the genotype of each individual and how they combine during mating. The key concept here is that each parent contributes one allele to their offspring, so the possible genotypes for the offspring are AA, aa, BB, bb, CC, cc, AABB, AAbb, AABBCC, etc. Among these possibilities, only AABBCC satisfies the condition of being an AABBCC individual. Therefore, we need to find the probability of this combination occurring. This can be done by considering each parent's genotype and calculating the probability of their offspring inheriting the necessary alleles for AABBCC.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
