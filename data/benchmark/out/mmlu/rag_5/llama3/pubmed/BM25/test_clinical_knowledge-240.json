["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for the energy expended during exercise. The given information about the athlete's steady-rate oxygen uptake averaging 3.0 l/min is related to the energy expenditure. From the provided documents, we can find that the Energy Accounting Model in the 'Energy expended in alternate foodservice systems for chicken menu items' document provides information on BTUs (British Thermal Units) expended per weight of chicken menu item processed for service. However, this model is not directly applicable here as it's about chicken menu items and exercise is different. The Load and Velocity of Contraction Influence Gross and Delta Mechanical Efficiency study provided more relevant information, but it's not specifically about energy expenditure during steady-rate exercise.\n\nFrom the 'Muscular efficiency during steady-rate exercise. II. Effects of walking speed and work rate' document, we can find that energy expenditure (calculated from the steady-rate respiration) is related to increasing work rate and speed. However, this information is not specific enough to calculate the exact energy expenditure for the given athlete's oxygen uptake.\n\nThe 'Energy utilisation of medium chain triglyceride in comparison with long chain triglyceride in growing chicks' document provides some information on energy retention, but it's not directly applicable here as it's about chickens and exercise is different.\n\nIn conclusion, the provided documents do not provide a straightforward way to calculate the exact energy expenditure for the given athlete's oxygen uptake. However, we can try to estimate the energy expenditure based on general knowledge or similar studies.\", \n\"answer_choice\": \"C: 300 kJ\""]
