["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to the provided documents, fertilization takes place in the gill chamber of freshwater mussels for Rhodeus sericeus sinensis. For rat ovum, fertilization occurs when the spermatozoon is attached to the vitelline membrane. Penetration of spermatozoon into the ovum and transformation of the sperm nucleus into the male pronucleus occur in the domestic fowl. The rotational movement of a spermatozoon around its long axis does not specify the location. Capacitation of spermatozoa occurs in the uterus and tubes for mammals. Since this is a vertebrate-specific question, I will focus on the structure where fertilization takes place in vertebrates.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
