["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking to determine the Doppler shift in perceived sound frequency. The Doppler shift formula requires the speed of sound in medium (I), time of interaction between sound source and detector (II) or distance between source and detector (III). Since IV, the frequency of emitted sound, does not affect the Doppler shift calculation, it is not a necessary variable.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B: I and III\""]
