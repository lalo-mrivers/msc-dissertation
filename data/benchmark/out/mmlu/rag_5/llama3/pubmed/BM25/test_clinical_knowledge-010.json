["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, we need to understand the blood group compatibility rules. ABO blood group system has four main types: A, B, O, and AB. In this case, we have a person with blood group B (rhesus negative). According to the documents provided, A2 subtype of blood group A can be transplanted across the ABO blood group barrier into recipients of O or B blood type. Since the person has blood group B, it is compatible with A2 subtype of blood group A and blood group O. Therefore, the compatible blood types that can be given to a person with blood group B (rhesus negative) are blood type A2 and blood type O.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
