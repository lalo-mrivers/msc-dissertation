["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the provided documents, we can see that the distribution of sensory and motor axons of the intercostal nerves and their branches is described. The histochemical method was used to differentiate motor and sensory fibres in the intercostal nerves and their branches. The percentage of motor fibres in the paravertebral sections of the upper segments is 30-35%, increasing to 45% in comparable zones of the lower segments. This suggests that the distribution of motor and sensory axons changes along the length of the intercostal nerves. In relation to the rib, we can infer from this information that the corresponding intercostal nerve lies superficial to its superior border.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
