["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the use of recombinant inbred (RI) series of mice to detect quantitative trait loci (QTLs) that account for small amounts of variance in quantitative traits such as behavior. QTL analysis is also used to identify chromosome regions associated with a complex trait in a genetic cross, which is described in 'The use of CXB recombinant inbred mice to detect quantitative trait loci in behavior'. Additionally, the document 'Maximum likelihood mapping of quantitative trait loci using full-sib families' presents a maximum likelihood method for detecting QTLs using flanking markers in full-sib families. This suggests that QTL analysis is used to identify chromosome regions associated with a complex trait in a genetic cross.\",\n\"answer_choice\": A"]
