["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the transport of free fatty acids in the blood. The documents provided discuss fatty acid transport by Nocardia asteroides, transfer of fatty acids across the rabbit placenta, and muscle triglyceride metabolism during exercise. From these documents, we can conclude that fatty acids are transported as free fatty acids, not combined with glucose. In the case of Nocardia asteroides, fatty acids were found to be translocated in the cytoplasmic localization of acyl-coenzyme A synthetase, which suggests that they are released intracellularly as free fatty acids. Similarly, in the rabbit placenta study, labelled palmitate was present in the foetus in 2 min and reached a peak in 3 min after injection into the mother, suggesting rapid transport of free fatty acids across the placenta.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
