["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to the documents, repressor binds to DNA primarily at sites other than the lac operator. Inducers like lactose shift repressor from operator to nonoperator DNA but do not free it from DNA. A mutation that prevents binding of repressor to lactose should result in constitutive expression of the lac operon genes as repressor is unable to bind to the operator and prevent transcription.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
