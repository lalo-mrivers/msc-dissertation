["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the net production of ATP via substrate-level phosphorylation in glycolysis. We can infer that this refers to the production of ATP through glycolytic pathways, such as glycolysis and fermentation. From the provided documents, we know that in glycolysis, substrate-level phosphorylation occurs when D-fructose 6-phosphate is further catabolized, resulting in net ATP production. This process is mentioned in the study 'Oscillations in glycolysis: multifactorial quantitative analysis in muscle extract'. The study also mentions that the oscillatory pattern of glycolysis can be suppressed by D-fructose 2,6-bisphosphate. We can conclude that substrate-level phosphorylation in glycolysis produces ATP.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
