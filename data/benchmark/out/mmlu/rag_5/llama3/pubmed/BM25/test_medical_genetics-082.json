["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Fragile-X syndrome is characterized by the presence of an unstable microsatellite repeat, p(CCG)n. This instability leads to somatic variation due to increased instability, which explains the unusual segregation patterns of fragile-X phenotype. The question asks about marked microsatellite instability, and based on this information, I can conclude that Fragile-X syndrome is a strong candidate.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
