["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question describes a recent theory about asthma attacks following thunderstorms. It suggests that pollen grains are too large to enter the airways but their exposure to water causes release of starch granules due to osmotic shock. These starch granules can then enter the lower airways and trigger an asthmatic attack. To understand this process, we need to think about the properties of the pollen grains. We know that the starch granules are released from the intracellular starch granules within the pollen grains. This suggests that the pollen grains must have a higher osmotic pressure than the surrounding environment, which would cause the release of these granules through osmotic shock.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
