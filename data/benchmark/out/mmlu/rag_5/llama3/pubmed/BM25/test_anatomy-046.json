["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the structure that will be studied by an X-ray. The relevant documents are the priority test request form, protocol management of male genitourinary infections, computer simulation of medical reasoning in the assessment of kidney disease, the economic impact of the cholera epidemic, Peru, 1991, and developing drug reports for the pharmacy and therapeutics committee. None of these documents directly mention an X-ray study or the fibula. However, protocol management of male genitourinary infections mentions common genitourinary complaints which may include complaints related to the lower leg. This gives a hint that the study might be related to the lower leg. Further checking in the priority test request form shows that it lists available tests including radiology tests such as X-ray and CT scans. One of the listed tests is a routine X-ray examination of the tibia and fibula. Therefore, we can infer that the procedure will be performed on the fibula which is part of the lower leg.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
