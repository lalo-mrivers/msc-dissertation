["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the documents, we can see that Type I fibres are characterized by being 'red' (in Metabolic characteristics of fibre types in human skeletal muscle) and having an oxidative potential higher than Type II fibres. We also know from Course of denervation atrophy in type I and type II fibres of rat extensor digitorum longus muscle that Type I fibres, the smallest of the normal muscle, do not change their diameters and therefore represent the largest fibres after denervation.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: red, oxidative, slow contracting\"\n}"]
