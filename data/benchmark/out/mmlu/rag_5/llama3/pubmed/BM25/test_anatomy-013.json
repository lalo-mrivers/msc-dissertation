["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking why the vocal fold on the injured side is tensed and in an intermediate position between adduction and abduction after suspected recurrent laryngeal nerve damage. The relevant information comes from the document [Light and electron microscopy of human vocal muscle in recurrent laryngeal nerve paresis (author's transl)]. According to this document, in longstanding recurrent laryngeal nerve paresis with paramedian fixation of the vocal cord, the fine structure of the vocal muscle is surprisingly well preserved. The cricothyroid muscle is paralyzed, which means it cannot contract and pull the vocal fold into adduction. On the other hand, the interarytenoid muscles are fully active, as there is no nerve damage to these muscles. Therefore, the vocal fold on the injured side is tensed and in an intermediate position between adduction and abduction because the cricothyroid muscle is paralyzed but the interarytenoids are fully active.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
