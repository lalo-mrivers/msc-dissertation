["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The Hardy-Weinberg law is a set of mathematical equations that describe the equilibrium behavior of gene frequencies in a population. To operate with respect to a population of organisms, each of the following conditions must be met: 1) The population size should be large enough to allow for random mating and the removal of genetic drift; 2) There should be no mutation, migration or selection pressure that would change the allele frequencies; 3) The population should have a constant size and there should be no genetic drift.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
