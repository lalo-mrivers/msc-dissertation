["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the symplastic pathway for the movement of sucrose from the site of photosynthesis in mesophyll cells into the phloem. We are given documents about plant transport and metabolism, including a discussion on phloem loading and the expression of a 62-kD sucrose binding protein in tissues involved in sucrose transport. Based on this information, we can infer that the symplastic pathway likely involves the movement of sucrose through plasmodesmata from mesophyll cells into companion cells, which then load the sucrose into the phloem.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: Bundle sheath, phloem parenchyma, companion cell, sieve tube\"\n}"]
