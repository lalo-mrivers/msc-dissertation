["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The urea cycle involves the conversion of ammonia into urea. Ornithine is one of the participants in this process. The citric acid cycle is another metabolic pathway. The question asks how ornithine is regenerated during each turn of the urea cycle, similar to a participant in the citric acid cycle. We need to find a component of the citric acid cycle that is recycled or regenerated similarly to ornithine.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
