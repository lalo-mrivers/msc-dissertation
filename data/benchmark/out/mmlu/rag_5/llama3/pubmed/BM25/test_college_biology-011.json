["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"After reviewing the relevant documents, I can see that there are different signal peptides involved in targeting proteins to various destinations. The documents mention uncleavable signal peptide at the NH2 terminus for LGP85, which is a lysosomal membrane glycoprotein. Additionally, there's information about chloroplasts and their outer envelope membrane protein, which doesn't require a cleavable transit peptide or ATP for import into isolated chloroplasts. Finally, there's discussion of prohormone processing in yeast, including the use of monobasic amino acids as processing sites. Given this information, I can conclude that targeting of a newly synthesized protein to lysosomes is most likely to require two different signal peptides.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
