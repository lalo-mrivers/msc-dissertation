["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the provided documents, we can identify that hypertonic solutions have a higher concentration of solutes than the normal human cell. For example, in the document 'Volume therapy with hypertonic saline hydroxyethyl starch solution in cardiac surgery', it states that patients received a new hypertonic saline hydroxyethyl starch solution to double baseline pulmonary capillary wedge pressure. Similarly, in the document 'Inhibitory action of hypertonic urea solution on the potassium contracture of the heart ventricular muscle', it mentions that the contracture induced by 100 mM potassium solution was markedly inhibited in a medium of three times hypertonic urea. Therefore, based on these documents, we can conclude that a hypertonic solution is one that has a higher concentration of solutes than the normal human cell.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
