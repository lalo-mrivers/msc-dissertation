["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The document describes three stages of heart rate response to reversible central hypovolaemia. In the first stage (corresponding to a reduction of the blood volume by approximately 15%), a modest increase in heart rate (<100 beats/min) and total peripheral resistance compensate for the blood loss, and near-normal arterial blood pressure prevails (preshock). This suggests that up to 15% of blood can be lost before changes in heart rate and blood pressure are reflected. The document does not provide further details on the subsequent stages.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: 30%\"\n}"]
