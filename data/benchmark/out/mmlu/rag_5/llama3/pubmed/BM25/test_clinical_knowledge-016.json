["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about a thyroid swelling. I need to look for information related to thyroid nodules or goiter in the provided documents. After reviewing the texts, I found that there are some points mentioned about thyroid function and its relation to heart disease, but nothing specific about thyroid swellings or nodules. So, I will rely on general knowledge of thyroid nodules and combine it with what I know from the medical literature.\n\nThyroid nodules can be functional (producing thyroid hormones) or non-functional (not producing thyroid hormones). Functional nodules may cause symptoms such as hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism. Non-functional nodules are usually benign, but some can be malignant. Asymptomatic nodules that do not produce hormone are more likely to be benign than those that do.\n\nThe presence of a swelling in the thyroid gland does not necessarily indicate that it is producing hormones. The document 'Thyroid disease in pregnancy' mentions hyperthyroidism as a possibility, but it does not specifically mention thyroid swellings or nodules. Therefore, I will rely on general knowledge and consider options A to D.\n\nOption A, 'It always elevates on swallowing', is incorrect because some thyroid nodules do not elevate on swallowing (straining). Option B, 'Lymph node enlargement is a good prognostic sign', is also incorrect because the presence of lymph nodes can indicate either benign or malignant disease. Option C, 'An ultrasound of the swelling is the best test to determine whether the nodule is actively secreting hormone', is partially correct but not entirely accurate because an ultrasound alone may not be enough to diagnose a functioning nodule. Option D, 'A functioning nodule on isotope scanning is unlikely to be due to cancer', is also incorrect because some functional nodules can be malignant.\n\nBased on my step-by-step thinking and combining general knowledge with what I know from the medical literature, the correct answer is none of the above (not A, B, C or D).\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
