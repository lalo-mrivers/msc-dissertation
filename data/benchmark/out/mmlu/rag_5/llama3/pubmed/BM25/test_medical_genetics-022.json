["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the documents provided, it is clear that glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency affects red blood cells. The document 'Erythrocytic glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency in the Bania community of Punjab' states that G6PD deficiency shows X-linked inheritance. This information helps to eliminate options A and B, as autosomal dominant and recessive patterns would not be consistent with the observed sex-specific incidence of the deficiency. Option C is also eliminated because a dominant pattern would not explain why the deficiency does not affect females or only affects them at a much lower frequency than males. Therefore, the correct answer must be D, X-linked recessive.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
