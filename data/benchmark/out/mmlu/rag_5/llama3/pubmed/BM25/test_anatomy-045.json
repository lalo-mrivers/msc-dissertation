["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the given documents, we can see that the viscerocranium is a part of the skull. The development of bones is either endochondral or intramembranous ossification. Endochondral ossification occurs when cartilage is replaced by bone, while intramembranous ossification occurs when bone forms directly from mesenchyme.\n\nThe first document talks about the development of the bony skull in chick embryos with unilateral anotia. It mentions that the desmal bones which develop in close contact with cartilage follow its margins and appear to be greatly dependent on the chondrocranium. This suggests that endochondral ossification is involved in the development of the viscerocranium.\n\nThe second document discusses the participation of neural crest-derived cells in the genesis of the skull in birds. It mentions that the origin of cartilages of the chondrocranium and bones of the neurocranium and viscerocranium has been shown to be mainly of mesodermal origin, with some parts having a dual origin. This suggests that both endochondral ossification and intramembranous ossification are involved in the development of the viscerocranium.\n\nThe third document discusses the influence of masticatory muscle function on craniofacial growth in hypocalcemic rats. It mentions that the viscerocranium was in an orthocranial position, indicating that it had developed abnormally. This suggests that the development of the viscerocranium is influenced by factors other than just endochondral or intramembranous ossification.\n\nThe fourth document discusses typical changes in the viscerocranium in acromegaly. It mentions that the ascending ramus and mandibular body were elongated, indicating abnormal growth. This suggests that the development of the viscerocranium is influenced by hormonal factors rather than just endochondral or intramembranous ossification.\n\nThe fifth document discusses eosinophilic granuloma of the maxilla. It mentions different forms depending on their localization, but this does not provide any information about the developmental processes involved.\n\nBased on the above analysis, it can be concluded that both endochondral ossification and intramembranous ossification are involved in the development of the viscerocranium.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
