["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the result of the DNA sequence experiencing both a point mutation and a deletion, we need to analyze the original sequence. The original sequence is 5'-GGATCCTCATG-3'. A point mutation can be either a substitution or an insertion/deletion (indel). Since there are no insertions in this case, it must be a substitution. Looking at the choices, only option B has a different base compared to the original sequence, which could result from a point mutation. The deletion is also present in option B, as the 'C' and 'T' bases are missing.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
