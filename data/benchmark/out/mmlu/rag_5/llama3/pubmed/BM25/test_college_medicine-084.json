["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks when a muscle fibre relaxes. From the provided documents, we can see that there is no direct information about muscle fibre relaxation or contraction. However, we can look at the physiological process of muscle contraction and relaxation. Muscle fibres contract when a nerve impulse stimulates them to do so. When the nerve stimulus is removed, the muscle fibre will naturally relax. This process is regulated by the interaction between actin and myosin filaments. The binding sites on these filaments are responsible for the muscle fibre's ability to contract or relax.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
