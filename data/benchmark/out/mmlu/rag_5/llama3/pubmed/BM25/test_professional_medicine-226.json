["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has a fracture affecting the right side of the face, causing numbness on the right side of the tongue and cheek. The fracture involves the orbit, zygomatic arch, and infratemporal fossa, which suggests that it is located in the middle part of the facial skull. The Foramen spinosum is not a likely location as it is situated on the occipital bone and does not correspond to the symptoms described.
