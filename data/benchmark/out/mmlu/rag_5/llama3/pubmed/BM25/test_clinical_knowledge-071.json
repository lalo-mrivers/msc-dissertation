["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"After reviewing the provided documents, I noticed that a study on chest compression rates during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) compared two different rates of precordial compression: 80 compressions per minute and 120 compressions per minute. The results showed that end-tidal carbon dioxide levels were slightly higher at a compression rate of 120 per minute, but still within the acceptable range. No significant difference in efficacy was observed between the two rates. Therefore, I will consider the option A: 80/minute as the most relevant.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
