["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The passage describes the movement of a fluorescent molecule from one cell to another. The molecule is small (1,000 daltons), so it can pass through the plasma membrane. We are looking for a type of intercellular junction that allows this type of movement. Gap junctions allow the direct transfer of ions and small molecules between cells. They are also known as connexions. This type of junction would allow the fluorescent molecule to move from one cell to another.\", \"answer_choice\": C}"]
