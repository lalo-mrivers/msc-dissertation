["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents describe meiosis in various organisms. Synchronized meiosis and recombination are observed in fission yeast with the pat1-114 mutation. Recombination between homologous chromosomes is a function of meiosis, which requires the synthesis of proteins or enzymes that facilitate synapsis and exchange. The REC102 gene is expressed only in meiosis, prior to the reductional division, at about the time that genetic recombination occurs. This suggests that recombination during meiosis takes place before metaphase I.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
