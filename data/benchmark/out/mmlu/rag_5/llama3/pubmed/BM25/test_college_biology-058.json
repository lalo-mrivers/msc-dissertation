["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the first group of animals to develop lung tissue adequate to support their respiratory requirements without supplementary gas exchange organs. The provided documents are related to air sacs, blood flow distribution in duck lungs, temporary lung support using an intravascular gas exchanger, calibration of respiratory gas exchange measurements, and distinguishing between infection, rejection, and the adult respiratory distress syndrome after human lung transplantation. None of these documents provide direct information about the development of lung tissue or supplementary gas exchange organs in different animal groups. Therefore, we must rely on general biological knowledge to answer this question.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
