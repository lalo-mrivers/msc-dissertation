["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the provided documents, it is clear that surfactant plays a crucial role in facilitating oxygen diffusion. Surfactant is a surface tension-lowering agent that allows the alveoli to stay open and expand with each breath. This expansion facilitates oxygen diffusion across the alveolar membranes. Additionally, the production of surfactant is essential for maintaining alveolar stability. The studies suggest that premature infants have inadequate surfactant production, leading to respiratory distress syndrome (RDS). Therefore, it can be concluded that surfactant plays a role in facilitating oxygen diffusion by maintaining alveoli in an open state.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
