["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking which option is not a controlled drug. All the options provided are prescription medications for pain management, which are typically controlled drugs. Therefore, we need to analyze each option separately to identify which one does not fit the definition of a controlled drug. Option A (Codeine Phosphate for injection) and Option D (Morphine 10 mg in 5 ml in oral suspension) are injectable forms of medications, which implies they require prescription and control. Options B (Sustained release Morphine tablet) and C (Fentanyl patch) are long-acting formulations of controlled substances that also require prescription. Based on this analysis, we can conclude that none of the options is not a controlled drug.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
