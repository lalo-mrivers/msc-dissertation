["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the system that rational choice theory is premised on. The passage discusses a theory on the control of arbitrary movements, learning to 'walk our talk' in health promotion, shapes of reaction-time distributions and shapes of learning curves, the growth of mammals following a period of nutritional limitation, and a bidimensional theory of achromatic color vision. None of these theories are mentioned as being related to rational choice theory or actions chosen based on benefit to the individual. Therefore, we must consider the passage in its entirety. The three main assumptions of rational theory are completeness, transitivity, and independence of variables. There is no mention of hierarchical, patriarchal, matriarchal, or oligarchic systems in this context.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
