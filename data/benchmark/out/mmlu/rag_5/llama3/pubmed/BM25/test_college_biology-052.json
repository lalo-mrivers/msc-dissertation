["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about plant embryogenesis. Let's look at the provided documents. The first document talks about repression of asexual embryogenesis in vitro by some plant growth regulators. This doesn't seem relevant to the question. The second document is about classification of Klebsielleae and yeasts, which has nothing to do with plant embryogenesis. The third document is about control of morphogenesis in tobacco protoplast cultures, but it's not specifically about embryogenesis either. The fourth document is about heat shock and thermotolerance in plant and animal embryogenesis. This seems relevant! It talks about the developmental regulation of the heat shock response during early embryogenesis. The last document is about a computer program for analyzing electrocardiograms, which has no connection to plant embryogenesis.\n\nFrom this review, we can see that the formation of precursors of all three plant tissue systems (epicotyl, cotyledon, and radicle) does occur during embryogenesis (document 4). Therefore, option D is correct. The other options are not directly supported by the provided documents.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
