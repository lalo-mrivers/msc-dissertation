["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the documents provided, we can see that the genetics of sex determination is discussed in 'Molecular analysis of tra-2, a sex determining gene in C.elegans'. The document states that adult hermaphrodites have approximately 15-fold more tra-2 RNA than adult males. It also mentions that adult hermaphrodites contain 5 kb and 1.8 kb tra-2 RNAs whereas adult males possess 5 kb and 1.9 kb RNAs. This suggests that the sex of a child is determined by the expression of tra-2 gene, which is influenced by the number of X chromosomes.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B\n}"]
