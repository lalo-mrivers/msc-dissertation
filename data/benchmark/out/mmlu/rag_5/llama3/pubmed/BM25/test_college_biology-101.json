["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking how cyanobacteria differ from green unicellular algae. Cyanobacteria are prokaryotic organisms that photosynthesize using light-dependent reactions. They have a different cell structure and biochemistry compared to eukaryotic organisms like green algae. One key difference is the presence of a nucleus in eukaryotes, which is absent in prokaryotes like cyanobacteria. Additionally, cyanobacteria lack cell walls, whereas green algae have cell walls composed of cellulose.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C: Cyanobacteria have no nuclei.\""]
