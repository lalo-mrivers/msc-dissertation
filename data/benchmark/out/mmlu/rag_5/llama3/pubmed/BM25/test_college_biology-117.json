["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for an explanation of why net primary productivity in terrestrial ecosystems tends to increase toward the tropics. We can analyze the provided documents and look for information related to primary productivity. The first document 'Effect of animal husbandry on herbivore-carrying capacity at a regional scale' mentions that livestock biomass in South American agricultural ecosystems across a 25-fold gradient of primary productivity exhibited a relationship with a slope essentially identical to unmanaged ecosystems, but with a substantially greater y-intercept. This suggests that there is an increase in biomass and size-structure of livestock herds with primary productivity. However, this document does not directly address the question about terrestrial ecosystems' net primary productivity.\n\nThe second document 'Geographical dimensions of terrestrial net and gross primary productivity' presents a comparative summary of previous attempts by the author to assess and map global primary productivity using environmental parameters as predictors. This suggests that there is an increase in net primary productivity with increasing temperature and precipitation, which are characteristics of tropical regions.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that the best explanation for why net primary productivity in terrestrial ecosystems tends to increase toward the tropics is due to the availability of water and warm temperatures (option C) which foster photosynthesis.\", \"answer_choice\": C}"]
