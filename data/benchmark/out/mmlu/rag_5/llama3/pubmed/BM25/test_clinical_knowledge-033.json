["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about calcium metabolism. We have documents related to antiarrhythmic drugs, calcium channel blockers for ischaemic heart disease, kidney tissue enzyme patterns from patients with calcium oxalate stone disease, and X-linked hypophosphatemia. None of these documents directly relate to calcium metabolism. Therefore, we need to look at other medical resources or documents.
