["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 15-year-old girl with acne, breast and pubic hair development at Tanner stage 5. Menarche occurred at age 14 years. The key information here is that breast and pubic hair development began at age 12 years. This indicates that the patient has already gone through most of her puberty process. The question is asking about the underlying cause of acne, which is likely related to hormonal changes during puberty. Androgens are known to stimulate sebaceous glands, leading to acne.\n\nLooking at the provided documents, we can see that in the study on secondary sex characteristics of boys 12-17 years old, it was found that skeletal age and serum urate levels were closely related to development of pubic hair and genitalia. This suggests that hormonal changes are involved in puberty.\n\nIn another study, the correlation between dental maturity, height development and sexual maturation in normal girls shows that there is no strong correlation between these factors, which further supports the idea that hormonal changes are driving the development of secondary sex characteristics during puberty.\n\nFinally, we can look at the clinical longitudinal standards for height, weight, height velocity, weight velocity, and stages of puberty. This study shows that breast and pubic hair development occur earlier in girls than boys, with median ages of 12.5 years and 13.4 years respectively.\n\nTaking all these factors into account, it is most likely that the underlying cause of this patient's acne is stimulation of the sebaceous glands by androgens (choice D).\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
