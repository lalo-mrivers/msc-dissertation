["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, we can see that X-linked immunodeficiencies such as XLA, XSCID, WAS, X-linked lymphoproliferative syndrome and X-linked hyper IgM syndrome have features in common, including expression limited to the hematopoietic system. The failure of carriers of these disorders to show signs of their gene defects is explained by the preferential use of the normal, non-mutant X as the active X in affected cell lineages. This information suggests that these disorders are inherited in an X-linked manner.\n\nThe Kell blood group and chronic granulomatous disease also provide relevant information. The lack of KX antigen on red cells and leukocytes, caused by inheritance of a variant allele at the X-linked locus, results in gross changes in Kell antigenicity. This is similar to the characteristics of X-linked immunodeficiencies.\n\nThe genomics of human dysmorphogenesis provides further support for the idea that these disorders are inherited in an X-linked manner, as it highlights the large Mendelian contribution to human dysmorphogenesis and contrasts single gene conditions with chromosomal disorders.\n\nOn the other hand, A critical appraisal of X-linked bipolar illness suggests that there is no evidence for the assumed mode of inheritance, which further supports the idea that X-linked immunodeficiencies are inherited in an X-linked manner, rather than bipolar illness.\n\nTherefore, based on these documents, it can be concluded that the disorders that show X-linked inheritance include XLA, XSCID, WAS, X-linked lymphoproliferative syndrome and X-linked hyper IgM syndrome. This information does not provide any evidence for or against X-linkage of Duchenne muscular dystrophy, Tay-Sachs disease, Haemophilia A, or Haemophilia B.\n\nThe answer choice options provided are: A-D, which correspond to different genetic disorders. Based on the provided documents, it can be concluded that none of these disorders show X-linked inheritance. Therefore, the correct answer is: all of the above (A-D).\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
