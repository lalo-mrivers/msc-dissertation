["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the teacher's observation that performance on quizzes has increased significantly but tardiness has only decreased slightly. The key to this problem is understanding operant conditioning and reinforcement schedules. A variable ratio schedule refers to a system where rewards are given at unpredictable intervals, whereas a continuous reinforcement schedule would provide rewards for every correct response. In this case, the teacher's reward system uses both types of schedules: daily stickers for showing up on time (variable interval) and weekly stickers for high quiz scores (fixed-ratio). This combination of schedules can lead to different effects on behavior, as the variable-interval schedule may not be strong enough to maintain consistent tardiness reduction. The significant increase in quiz performance suggests that students were highly motivated by the prospect of getting a sticker, which is an external motivator.\", \"answer_choice\": B}"]
