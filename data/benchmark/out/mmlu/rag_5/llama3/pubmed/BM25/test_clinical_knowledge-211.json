["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about when to use or not use a catheter valve. The relevant documents are [Endoscopic control of balloon dilatation of the pylorus] and [Investigations on the utilization of parenterally administered amino acids by premature and hypotrophic neonates (author's transl)].
