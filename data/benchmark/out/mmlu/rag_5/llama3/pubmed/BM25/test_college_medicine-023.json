["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the process that uses only the gradient of material to control the direction in which the material moves across the cell membrane. Among the options, osmosis and passive transport both use concentration gradients to move materials across the cell membrane. However, active transport and endocytosis do not rely solely on a material gradient. Therefore, the correct answer is B: Passive Transport.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
