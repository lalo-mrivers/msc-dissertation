["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to understand the concept of statistical power and type II error. A type II error occurs when a true effect exists but is not detected by the study due to low power. Increasing the sample size or decreasing alpha (0.01 in this case) can increase the power of the study. Since the alpha is set at 0.01, it means that we are more conservative and require a stronger evidence for significance. This can lead to fewer type I errors but may also result in a higher likelihood of type II errors.\", \"answer_choice\": D}"]
