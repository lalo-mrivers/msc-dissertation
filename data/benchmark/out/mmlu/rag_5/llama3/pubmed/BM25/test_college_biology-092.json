["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium is a statistical model that describes the dynamics of allele frequencies in a population. It assumes that the population is large enough to be considered infinite, there's no genetic drift, random mating occurs, and there's no natural selection. Therefore, we can conclude that none of the above options are correct assumptions for Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
