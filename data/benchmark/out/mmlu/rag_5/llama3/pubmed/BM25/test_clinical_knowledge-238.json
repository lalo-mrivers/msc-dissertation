["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the size of catheter bag that may be used at night. There are no relevant documents provided that specifically discuss the size of catheter bags for use at night. However, one document does describe using a catheter with a bulb that was inflated to a total volume of 25 cc. This suggests that the size of the balloon may affect the overall size of the catheter bag. Another document describes using an intestinal isolation bag to house the small intestines during laparotomy. This type of bag is designed to keep organs out of the operative field and does not provide information about catheter bags used at night. The remaining documents do not discuss catheter bags or their sizes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
