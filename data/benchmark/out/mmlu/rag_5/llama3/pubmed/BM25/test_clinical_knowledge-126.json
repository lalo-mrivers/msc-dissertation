["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the composition of our genetic material. The documents provided contain information about DNA, chromosomes, and genes. We can infer that the correct answer is a type of nucleic acid. Considering the study on the formation of the heart tube in chick embryos, we see that 'DNA isolated from chick Rous sarcoma' was used to reproduce the infection process. This suggests that DNA is a crucial component of genetic material. Furthermore, in the document about 10p- syndrome associated with multiple chromosomal abnormalities, we see the term 'autosomal abnormalities' and 'deoxyribonucleic acid', which implies that DNA is an important part of our genetic material.\",\n\"answer_choice\": A"]
