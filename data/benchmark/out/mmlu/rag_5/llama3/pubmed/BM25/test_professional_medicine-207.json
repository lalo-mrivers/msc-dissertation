["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the effects of exercise on various physiological parameters during a 15-minute session. Since we are given the average pulse for the last 2 minutes of the session as 175/min, it implies that the heart rate is increased due to exercise. This suggests that stroke volume (B) and total peripheral resistance (D) might be increased. Pulse pressure (A) is not directly related to the given information. Systolic blood pressure (C) could also be increased, but we are looking for a parameter that is most likely to be decreased during the last minute of exercise. Considering the documents provided, we can see that during exercise, renal blood flow is decreased in both baboons and humans. This might suggest that some vascular resistance increases, leading to an increase in systolic blood pressure (C). However, total peripheral resistance (D) could also be increased due to vasoconstriction. Given this information, the most likely parameter to be decreased during the last minute of exercise is cardiac output, which would lead to a decrease in stroke volume (B).\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
