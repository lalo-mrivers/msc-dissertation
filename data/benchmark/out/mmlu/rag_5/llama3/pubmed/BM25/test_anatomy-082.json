["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the distribution of extracellular tracers in perivascular spaces of the rat brain. The tracers remained largely in the perivascular spaces and in the interconnecting network of extracellular channels, including the subpial space and the core of subarachnoid trabeculae. Tracer also leaked across the pia into subarachnoid CSF. This suggests that cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) circulates around the brain between the pia mater and brain surface.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
