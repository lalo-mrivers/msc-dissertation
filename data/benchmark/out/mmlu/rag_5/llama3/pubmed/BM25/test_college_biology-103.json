["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the target of digestion of a nucleosome dimer to nucleosome monomers by DNase. From the provided documents, we know that DNase I digests nucleohistone particles, and its cutting sites are located within the spacer region of the nucleosome. The document also explains the periodicity of 10.4 bases along the DNA, which is not found in micrococcal nuclease digestion products. This information suggests that the target of digestion is likely the linker DNA between nucleosomes.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
