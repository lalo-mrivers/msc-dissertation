["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about Selective Androgen Receptor Modulators (SARMs). We need to analyze the given documents to determine how SARMs work. According to the document [Expression of androgen receptor gene in normal subjects and patients with complete androgen insensitivity], we can see that dihydrotestosterone (DHT) binds to androgen receptors, causing a 3-5 fold increase in genital skin fibroblasts. This suggests that SARMs mimic the effects of natural steroid hormones on androgen receptors.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom the document [Androgen Therapy in an 'excessively' tall boy], we can see that androgen administration accelerated sexual development and fusion of epiphyses, indicating that SARMs, like androgens, can stimulate androgen receptor-mediated processes.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe documents [Binding properties of androgen receptors] and [Effects of proteases and protease inhibitors on the 4.5 S and 8 S androgen receptor] provide information about the binding properties of androgen receptors. These documents do not directly relate to SARMs, but they help us understand how androgens interact with androgen receptors.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe document [Androgen Receptor in Human Skin Fibroblasts] describes the characterization of a specific 17beta-hydroxy-5alpha-androstan-3-one-protein complex (DHT-binding activity) in cell sonicates and nuclei. This document also does not directly relate to SARMs, but it provides information about how androgens interact with androgen receptors.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn summary, based on the given documents, SARMs are steroid drugs that act on androgen receptors mimicking the effects of natural steroid hormones.\",\n\"answer_choice\": A"]
