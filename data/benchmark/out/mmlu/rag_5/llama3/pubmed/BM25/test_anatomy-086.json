["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the postnatal growth of the maxilla. The relevant documents discuss various aspects of animal development, including skull growth, facial skeleton development, liver growth, brain growth, and glandular growth. Since the question focuses on the maxilla, I should look for information related to this topic. One document that seems relevant is 'Growth mechanisms in skulls with facial clefts.' This article discusses the postnatal development of rabbit skulls with facial clefts. It mentions a deviation of the upper jaw to the non-cleft side and retropositioning of the maxilla on the cleft side. This information suggests that the maxilla can change shape and position after birth.\n\nAnother document that might be relevant is 'Postnatal growth of the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus of the cat.' While this article primarily discusses brain development, it also mentions the general pattern of postnatal growth in cats, which involves a rapid increase in volume followed by a plateau. This information could be useful in understanding the overall context of maxillary growth.\n\nConsidering these findings and the options provided, I believe that the correct statement about the postnatal growth of the maxilla is...\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C: The zygomaticomaxillary sutures contribute to increase in height and length of the maxilla\""]
