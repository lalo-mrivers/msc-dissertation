["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The exercise prescription documents state that as intensity exceeds the anaerobic threshold, anaerobic glycolysis is inhibited, forcing a decrease in exercise intensity. This suggests that at high intensities of exercise, anaerobic energy production is not possible. Since aerobic energy production is always possible, it can be inferred that the higher the intensity of exercise, the greater the proportional contribution of aerobic energy production.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
