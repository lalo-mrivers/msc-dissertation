["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents are about neuron populations, synaptic potential dynamics, impulse activity of a neuron, and pain transmission. The question is asking where an impulse is transmitted from one neuron to another. We can see in the document 'Pain and painkillers. 1. Neurophysiologic component' that a pain impulse is transmitted in the thin nerves from nerve cell to nerve cell by means of neurotransmitters and -modulators, shed in the synapses. This suggests that an impulse is transmitted between neurons at the synapse.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
