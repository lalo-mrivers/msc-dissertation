["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is experiencing chest pain and shortness of breath after snorting cocaine for the first time. The ECG shows sinus tachycardia with no ST-segment or T-wave abnormalities. The patient's vital signs are stable, but they are diaphoretic and have a blood pressure of 200/100 mm Hg. Given the patient's presentation and the absence of cardiac abnormality on ECG, it is unlikely that the patient has an acute coronary syndrome. However, given the severity of the chest pain and shortness of breath, further evaluation and management are needed to rule out other potential causes.\n\nThe initial treatment with aspirin, nitroglycerin, and lorazepam was likely intended to manage the patient's symptoms and potentially reduce the risk of cardiac complications. However, the patient continues to experience chest pain and shortness of breath despite this therapy.\n\nAt this point, it is unclear whether the patient's symptoms are primarily due to cocaine-induced vasospasm or another factor. Given the severity of the patient's symptoms and the uncertainty surrounding their cause, further pharmacotherapy is indicated.\n\nPiritramide, a medication used for postoperative pain treatment, is mentioned in one of the provided documents. However, it does not seem relevant to this patient's situation given its indication and mechanism of action.\n\nKetorolac tromethamine, an injectable nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug approved for short-term pain management, is also mentioned in one of the provided documents. However, it too does not seem directly relevant to this patient's situation given its indication and mechanism of action.\n\nAlbuterol, a medication used to treat bronchospasm, is mentioned in one of the provided documents as part of the treatment for anaphylactoid reaction following ketorolac tromethamine administration. However, it too does not seem directly relevant to this patient's situation given its indication and mechanism of action.\n\nIn contrast, the other options presented, carvedilol, furosemide, metoprolol, and phentolamine, are all medications with mechanisms of action that could potentially be relevant to this patient's situation.\n\nCarvedilol is a beta blocker that can help reduce blood pressure and alleviate symptoms of vasospasm.\n\nFurosemide is a diuretic that can help reduce fluid overload and alleviate symptoms of heart failure.\n\nMetoprolol is a beta blocker that can help reduce blood pressure, alleviate symptoms of vasospasm, and stabilize the cardiac rhythm.\n\nPhentolamine is an alpha blocker that can help dilate blood vessels and relieve vasospasm.\n\nOf these options, carvedilol or metoprolol may be the most appropriate additional pharmacotherapy to initiate at this time given their potential benefits in managing the patient's symptoms and reducing the risk of cardiac complications.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
