["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The text describes an experiment where subjects performed 15 x 40m sprints with rest periods of either 120s (R120), 60s (R60) or 30s (R30). The performance data showed that running speed over the last 10m of each sprint decreased in all three protocols, but performance during the initial acceleration period from 0-15m was only affected with the shortest rest periods. This suggests that anaerobic energy production is being used to power the sprints. As the number of sprints increases, it's likely that the anaerobic contribution would also increase.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
