["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The problem is about an object resting on a plane with incline angle ?, acceleration due to gravity g, and coefficient of friction µ. We need to find the acceleration of the object. The key is to relate the acceleration to the forces acting on the object: gravity (g) and friction (µ). Since the object is on an inclined plane, we should consider both the component of gravity parallel to the plane (g sin ?) and the force due to friction (-µ g cos ?).\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
