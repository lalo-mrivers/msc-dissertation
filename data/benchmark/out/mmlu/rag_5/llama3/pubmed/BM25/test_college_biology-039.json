["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the development of a vertebrate organism from the zygote stage to fetus. The relevant documents provided describe different stages of development, including the structure of the rhombencephalic roof in the frog, the development of the zygote and formation of sporoblasts, and the role of motor activity in determining the beginning of initiation of the organism individual development from the moment of zygote formation. None of these documents directly address the concept of ontogeny recapitulating phylogeny or the display of identical features of class, order, and species in early embryos. However, they do highlight the importance of considering the stage of development corresponding to the pattern of expression of oncodevelopmental proteins in neoplastic transformation and neoplasia.\n\nIn light of these findings, it can be concluded that an early human embryo has features in common with early fish and avian embryos, as suggested by option C. This is because the development of a vertebrate organism from the zygote stage to fetus shares similarities across different species.\", \"answer_choice\": C}"]
