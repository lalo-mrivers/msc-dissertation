["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents provide information about mitochondrial structure and function. The studies on Physarum polycephalum show that the mitochondrial nucleoid elongates longitudinally while the mitochondrion increases in size, but does not divide until the mitochondrial membrane invaginates and separates the contents. There is no evidence of glycogen or triacylglycerol molecules embedded in the inner membrane of the mitochondrion. The electron transport chain is mentioned in the context of electron transfer between the outer and inner membranes, but it is not directly described as being embedded in the inner membrane. The tricarboxylic acid cycle (Krebs' cycle) is not specifically mentioned.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
