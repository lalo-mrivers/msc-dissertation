["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the function of sarcoplasmic reticulum in muscle cells. We have multiple documents to refer to: Effects of pH on the myofilaments and the sarcoplasmic reticulum, Cholesterol in muscle membranes, Regulation of sarcoplasmic reticulum gene expression during cardiac and skeletal muscle development, Sarcoplasmic reticulum in experimental myotonia in rats, The ion-conducting properties of Ca2+ ATPase in rabbit skeletal muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum. From these documents, we can see that the sarcoplasmic reticulum is involved in calcium transport and release. It stores calcium ions and regulates their release.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
