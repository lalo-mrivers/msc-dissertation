["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks which of the following statements identifies a chemically based sensory system. The options provided are Gustatory (I), Auditory (II), Olfactory (III), or a combination of Gustatory and Olfactory. Based on this information, we can infer that the correct answer must be related to the sense of smell or taste. This is because chemical molecules bind to odorant receptors in the olfactory system, allowing us to perceive smells, while chemicals in food and drinks stimulate the gustatory system, enabling us to taste. On the other hand, the auditory system does not rely on chemical signals. Therefore, we can eliminate options II and A, leaving us with Olfactory (III) or a combination of Gustatory and Olfactory.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
