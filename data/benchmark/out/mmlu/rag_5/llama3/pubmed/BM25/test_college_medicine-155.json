["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question states that the hormone is found both inside and out of cells when carrying out its function, increases the amount of nucleic acid in the cell while functioning, and is derived from a structure containing four hydroxycarbon rings. Based on this information, it can be inferred that the hormone has structural properties similar to those of steroid hormones. Additionally, the fact that the hormone's function involves increasing the amount of nucleic acid in the cell suggests that it may play a role in regulating gene expression or cellular metabolism, which is also consistent with the characteristics of steroid hormones.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
