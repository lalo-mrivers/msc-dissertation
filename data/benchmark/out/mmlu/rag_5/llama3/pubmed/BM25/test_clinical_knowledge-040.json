["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the provided documents, we can see that the document 'Amplitude of the first heart sound at rest and during exercise in normal subjects and in patients with coronary heart disease.' mentions that an increase in heart rate of 40 beats above resting levels resulted in a mean increase in S1 amplitude of 281 per cent in the control group. This suggests that the normal heart rate for adults at rest is likely to be around 60-80 bpm, as any higher rate would result in a significant increase in S1 amplitude.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
