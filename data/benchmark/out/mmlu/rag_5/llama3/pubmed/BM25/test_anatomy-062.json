["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the functions of the third cranial nerve. According to 'Mechanisms of efferent neuronal control of the reflex nicitating membrane response in rabbit', stimulation of the third nerve causes short-latency retraction of the nicitating membrane. In 'Traumatic ophthalmoplegia: a complication of fractures of the zygomaticomaxillary complex', ocul muscle imbalance is mentioned as a common complication, which may include ptosis caused by damage to the third cranial nerve. In 'Neurological impairment in congenital bilateral ptosis with ophthalmoplegia', congenital bilateral paralysis of the third cranial nerve is described, and it's hypothesized that the origin of the disorder might be due to mesencephalic impairment. Based on these documents, damage to the third cranial nerve by trauma to the orbit can cause ptosis.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
