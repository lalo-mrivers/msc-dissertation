["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the effects of 4-aminopyridine on transmitter release from motor nerve endings, as well as the actions of neosurugatoxin and omega-conotoxin on acetylcholine release and muscle nicotinic receptors. The effects of curare on endplate channels are also discussed. Additionally, the documents mention the influence of divalent cations such as Ca2+, Sr2+, Mn2+, and Mg2+ on miniature endplate potential frequency in frogs.\n\nIn this context, an action potential arriving at the motor endplate causes release of acetylcholine which then traverses the neuromuscular junction.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
