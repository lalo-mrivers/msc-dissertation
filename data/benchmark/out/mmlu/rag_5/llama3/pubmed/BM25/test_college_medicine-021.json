["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents discuss the transport of fatty acids by Nocardia asteroides, transfer across the rabbit placenta, effects of glucose infusion on total serum fatty acids and free fatty acids in rats, and muscle triglyceride metabolism during exercise. The study on the placental transport of fatty acids shows that maternal circulating free fatty acid concentrations affect umbilical venous-arterial differences, indicating that free fatty acids can cross the placenta. In another study, it is found that foetal white adipose tissue releases both free fatty acids and glycerol into the medium. This suggests that free fatty acids are transported across the placenta. Another study shows that muscle triglyceride metabolism during exercise involves mobilization of muscle triglycerides and release of free fatty acids. Based on these studies, it can be inferred that most of the free fatty acids are transported in the blood as lipoproteins or bound to albumin.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
