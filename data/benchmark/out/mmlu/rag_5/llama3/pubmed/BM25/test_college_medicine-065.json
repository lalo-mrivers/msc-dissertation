["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the ratio of purines : pyrimidines in a double stranded molecule of DNA. None of the provided documents mention anything specific about this topic in the context of DNA molecules. However, we can consider the general structure of DNA, which is composed of alternating base pairs of purines (A and G) and pyrimidines (C and T). This suggests that the ratio would be close to 1:1, but it's not necessarily a strict 1:1 ratio due to minor variations in the sequence.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
