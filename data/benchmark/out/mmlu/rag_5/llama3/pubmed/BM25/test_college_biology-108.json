["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about how marine birds maintain their internal osmolarity despite drinking seawater. The relevant information comes from the study on osmoregulatory actions of insulin-like growth factor-I in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). According to this study, fish can absorb salts from the environment and excrete them through specialized organs. Similarly, marine birds may have such mechanisms to maintain their internal osmolarity. The other options do not seem to be directly related to maintaining tissue osmolarity.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
