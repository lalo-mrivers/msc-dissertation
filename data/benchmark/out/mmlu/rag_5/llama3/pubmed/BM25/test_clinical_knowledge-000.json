["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the size of cannula used for a rapid blood transfusion. From the provided documents, we have information on arterial monitoring/perfusion cannulas designed for cardiac operations. The document highlights a double-lumen cannula with a large central lumen (12 to 26f) as the arterial inflow conduit from the pump oxygenator and a second smaller lumen (18 gauge) constructed in the wall of the first cannula acts as the pressure-monitoring port. Since the question asks about rapid blood transfusion, we can infer that it's not related to cardiac operations or monitoring perfusion. We don't have any specific information on the size of cannulas used for blood transfusions. However, based on general knowledge, smaller gauge sizes are typically used for arterial lines and larger gauge sizes for venous lines.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
