["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question describes the cross between a female fruit fly with gray body and normal wings and a male fruit fly with black body and vestigial wings. The presence of gray-bodied, vestigial-winged flies among the progeny suggests that the genes for these traits are linked, as the expected genotype would be for a gray-bodied, normal-winged individual. Therefore, we need to consider genetic mechanisms that can result in the recombination of linked genes. Crossing over is the most likely explanation, as it can lead to the exchange of genetic material between homologous chromosomes, resulting in the creation of new combinations of alleles.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
