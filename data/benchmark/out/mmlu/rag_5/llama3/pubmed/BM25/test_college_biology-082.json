["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the documents provided, it is clear that calcium plays a crucial role in the regulation of serum calcium levels. In 'The effects of 2-thiophenecarboxylic acid on serum ionic calcium and magnesium levels in rats', administration of 2-thiophenecarboxylic acid led to a significant depression in serum calcium levels, while in 'Regulation of serum gonadotropins by photoperiod and testicular hormone in the Syrian hamster', changes in calcium levels were observed. In 'Evidence that parathyroid hormone is not required for phosphate homeostasis in renal failure', the role of parathyroid hormone (PTH) was investigated, and it was found that PTH is not necessary for phosphate homeostasis in renal failure.\n\nIn 'Impaired release of parathyroid hormone in magnesium deficiency', it was discovered that the release of PTH is impaired in magnesium deficiency. Finally, in 'Role of calcium in secretion of chorionic gonadotropin by first trimester human placenta', it was demonstrated that calcium is essential for normal secretion of hCG by human placenta.\n\nTaking these findings into account, it can be inferred that the adequate serum levels of calcium are maintained in humans through the secretion of parathyroid hormone. This inference is supported by the data provided in 'Impaired release of parathyroid hormone in magnesium deficiency', which suggests that the release of PTH is impaired in magnesium deficiency.\n\nIn addition, 'Evidence that parathyroid hormone is not required for phosphate homeostasis in renal failure' provides evidence that PTH is not necessary for maintaining normal serum calcium levels. Therefore, it can be concluded that the adequate serum levels of calcium are maintained in humans by the secretion of parathyroid hormone.\", \"answer_choice\": D}"]
