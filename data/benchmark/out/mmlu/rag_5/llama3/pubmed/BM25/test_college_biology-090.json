["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the descendants of plants that have undergone spontaneous doubling of their chromosome number. This type of event is known as autopolyploidy. It's a well-known phenomenon in plant biology where a diploid (2n) plant becomes tetraploid (4n) through various mechanisms, including error-prone cell division or hybridization between species with different ploidy levels. The key point to consider is that the doubled chromosome number can restore meiotic fertility in these plants. This means that the descendants of these plants will have a normal ability to reproduce sexually.\n\nThe other options do not accurately describe the descendants of plants with double chromosome numbers. Option A suggests that the plant would be genetically defective, which is not necessarily true for all autopolyploid plants. Option B is incorrect because introgression requires the movement of genetic material between species or populations, which is not directly related to the ploidy level. Option C is also incorrect because backcrossing with the parental species assumes that the parental species have a similar ploidy level, which is not always the case.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D: The descendants would regain the ability to reproduce sexually because chromosomes could pair normally.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
