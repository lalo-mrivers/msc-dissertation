["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 15-year-old girl with a history of urinary tract infection treated with oral trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. She has asymptomatic hypertension with diastolic pressure above 90 mm Hg. The patient's height and weight are within the normal range, and her urinalysis and cardiac and renal ultrasonography show no abnormalities.\n\nThe patient does not have any other risk factors for hypertension. Therefore, it is likely that she has primary hypertension or a secondary cause of hypertension that needs to be identified.\n\nBased on the text, antihypertensive treatment with drugs should be considered when diastolic pressures exceed 90 mm Hg, provided that the patient has been observed when treated in other ways than by drugs for several months. However, this may not be necessary as there is no evidence of complications or organ damage.\n\nThe most appropriate next step in management would be to recommend an exercise and weight reduction program.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
