["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The provided documents do not directly relate to enzymes or chemical reactions. However, we can look at the information provided to identify relevant concepts. We see that one of the documents discusses pharmacopeias and methods used in compiling them. This does not seem relevant to the question about enzymes.\n\nWe also see a document discussing reflex swallowing elicited by water and chemical substances applied in the oral cavity, pharynx, and larynx of the rabbit. This information appears unrelated to enzymes or chemical reactions as well.\n\nThe only remaining documents are those related to surgical procedures and methods. These may seem unrelated to enzymes or chemical reactions at first glance, but they do provide insight into how procedures can be performed effectively.\n\nOne key concept is that high gastric resections for various pathologic conditions, although effective in treatment, are not without serious immediate and delayed complications. This suggests that improving operative solutions following a subtotal gastrectomy could prevent or significantly improve some of the post-gastrectomy sequences.\n\nThis concept could be applied to enzymes by thinking about how they facilitate chemical reactions. Enzymes lower the activation energy required for a reaction to occur, thereby speeding up the conversion of reactants to products.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that enzymes are effective in facilitating chemical reactions because they lower the activation energy, making it easier for the reaction to proceed.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
