["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to the provided documents, guanidinoacetic acid is synthesized from arginine or canavanine and glycine by glycine amidinotransferase (transamidinase) in kidney homogenates or slices. Since creatine is a precursor of guanidinoacetic acid, it is likely that creatine is also synthesized through a similar pathway. In the document 'Biosynthesis of guanidinoacetic acid in isolated renal tubules', it is mentioned that creatine suppressed guanidinoacetic acid synthesis, which suggests that creatine may be an intermediate or product of this process.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
