["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about polygenic Alzheimer disease. Polygenic means that there are multiple genes involved in the development of the disease. After reviewing the provided documents, it is clear that none of the documents directly discuss polygenic Alzheimer disease. However, one document does mention familial Alzheimer disease, which may be related to polygenic Alzheimer disease. The key point from this document is that the genetics of familial Alzheimer disease have yet to be elucidated. This suggests that the genetic basis of polygenic Alzheimer disease may not be fully understood either. Nevertheless, a review of the documents reveals that APOE (apolipoprotein E) has been mentioned as a gene involved in Alzheimer disease. While there is no direct evidence linking APOE to polygenic Alzheimer disease, it seems reasonable to assume that this gene might play some role given its involvement in familial Alzheimer disease.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
