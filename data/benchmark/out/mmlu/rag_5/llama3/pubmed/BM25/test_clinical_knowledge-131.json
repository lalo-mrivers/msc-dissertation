["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the Golgi tendon organ. From the given documents, we can see that it's mentioned as a proprioceptive sensory receptor that monitors the contraction of every motor unit in a muscle. This information is present in 'Heterogeneity of motor units activating single Golgi tendon organs in cat leg muscles.' It also mentions the location of procollagen in chick corneal and tendon fibroblasts, which doesn't seem directly relevant to the question. The document 'The incidence and variety of Golgi tendon organs in extraocular muscles of the rhesus monkey' talks about the shape and structure of these receptors. Finally, 'Tendon organs of cat medial gastrocnemius: responses to active and passive forces as a function of muscle length' provides information on their response to different types of forces. From all this information, we can conclude that Golgi tendon organs are proprioceptive sensory receptors found at the junction between muscle and tendon.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
