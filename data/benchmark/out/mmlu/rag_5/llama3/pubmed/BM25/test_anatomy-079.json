["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the role of noradrenaline as a neurotransmitter. In one study, it is found to exist in the thoracic ganglia and sixth abdominal ganglion of Periplaneta americana. This suggests that noradrenaline may be involved in the transmission of neural signals between these structures. Additionally, another study shows that noradrenaline inhibits transmitter efflux in a renal artery preparation, suggesting a role in regulating neurotransmitter release. Based on this information, it is likely that noradrenaline plays a role as a neurotransmitter between pre-ganglionic and post-ganglionic neurons.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
