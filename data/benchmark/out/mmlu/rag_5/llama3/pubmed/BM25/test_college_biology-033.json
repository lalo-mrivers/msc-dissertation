["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about characteristics typical of r-selected species. Based on the provided documents, there is no mention of human immunodeficiency virus or its relation to Trichomonas invasion. The document '[Similarity of the DNA mucleotide sequences of vibrios]' discusses DNA hybridization and homology in Vibrio species, but it does not provide information about r-selected species. The document '[Ultrastructure of hepatocytes is teleost fishes following food deprivation]' describes electron microscopy findings in liver tissue after fasting periods, but it does not relate to r-selected species either. The document 'Intramuscular myxoma: magnetic resonance features' discusses MRI characteristics of intramuscular myxomas and their diagnosis, which is also unrelated to the topic.\n\nThe only information provided that could be related to the question is from the document 'Pre-existing chronic infraepithelial Trichomonas invasion with consecutive immunodepression enables progression of human immunodeficiency virus: a new concept of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome pathogenesis.' This document describes the immune responses and sensitization caused by Trichomonas infections. However, it does not provide information about r-selected species.\n\nConsidering all the provided documents, we can conclude that there is no direct information about r-selected species. Therefore, to answer this question, we need to look at general biological concepts or external resources.\n\nOne common characteristic of r-selected species is their high competitive ability. This is because they often live in unstable environments and have a higher reproductive rate to ensure the survival of their offspring. However, this does not mean that all r-selected species have high competitive ability. Some may have different strategies for survival.\n\nBased on general biological knowledge, we can conclude that high competitive ability is NOT typical of r-selected species. This is because many r-selected species are adapted to unstable environments and have different life history strategies that do not necessarily involve competition with other species for resources.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
