["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the given documents, we can infer that if the activity of an enzyme is constant over a broad range of pH values, it suggests that ionizing groups on both the enzyme and substrate participate in the reaction. This is because changes in pH would affect the ionization states of these groups, which could potentially impact the reaction rate. However, since the activity remains constant across this range, it implies that the ionizing groups are not significantly influencing the reaction.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
