["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, we need to find the ratio of the area of the nozzle to the starting area of the hose. The problem states that the end of the nozzle is 1/3 the area of the start of the hose, so the ratio is 1:3 or 1/3. This means that the velocity of water at the nozzle will be higher than at the fire hydrant because the same pressure is applied to a smaller area. We can use Bernoulli's principle to find the final velocity of water as it exits the nozzle.\n\nBernoulli's principle states that for an incompressible fluid, the sum of the kinetic energy and potential energy per unit volume remains constant along the direction of flow. This means that as the area of the hose decreases, the velocity of the water increases to keep the pressure constant.\n\nThe equation for Bernoulli's principle is P + 1/2ρv^2 = constant, where P is the pressure, ρ is the density of water, and v is the velocity. Since the pressure is kept constant, we can rearrange the equation to solve for v:\n\nv^2 = (2P)/ρ\n\nWe know that the starting velocity is 2 m/s and the pressure is constant, so we can plug in these values:\n\nv^2 = (2P)/ρ\nv^2 = (2*10^5 Pa)/(1000 kg/m^3)\nv^2 ≈ 20.4 m^2/s^2\n\nTaking the square root of both sides gives us the final velocity of water as it exits the nozzle:\n\nv ≈ √(20.4 m^2/s^2) ≈ 4.48 m/s\n\nHowever, we know that the area of the nozzle is only 1/3 the area of the starting hose, so the actual velocity will be higher than this calculated value. We can use the conservation of mass principle to find the correct final velocity.\n\nThe mass flow rate of water (Q) remains constant throughout the hose:\n\nQ = ρA_0v_0\n\nwhere ρ is the density of water, A_0 is the area of the starting hose, and v_0 is the starting velocity. We can plug in these values:\n\nQ = 1000 kg/m^3*(π*0.1^2 m) * (2 m/s)\n\nSimplifying this equation gives us:\n\nQ ≈ 9.42 kg/s\n\nNow we can find the final velocity by dividing the mass flow rate by the area of the nozzle and the final density of water:\n\nv = Q / (ρA_n)\n= (9.42 kg/s) / ((1000 kg/m^3)*(π*(0.1/3)^2 m))\n≈ 5.95 m/s\n\nThis is our final answer, which we can see is approximately equal to 6 m/s.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
