["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, I will analyze the fate of lactate after vigorous activity in the leopard frog (Metabolic fate of lactate after vigorous activity in the leopard frog, Rana pipiens) and consider the options. In this study, it was found that most of the lactate accumulated by frogs seems to be recycled into muscle glycogen because the lactate that disappears during recovery could account nearly stoichiometrically for the glycogen that accumulates in muscle. This suggests that muscle is the main tissue responsible for the recycling of lactate into muscle glycogen and that liver plays a negligible role in lactate disposal. In support of this proposition, we show that frog liver perfused in vitro is unable to incorporate any detectable labeled lactate into glucose despite its excellent physiological integrity.\n\nNext, I will consider the study on ketogenesis from lactate in rat liver during the perinatal period (Ketogenesis from lactate in rat liver during the perinatal period). This study found that the main fate of lactate in the liver during the perinatal period was ketone bodies, preferentially over CO2 and lipids. The rate of oxidation of lactate and its incorporation into lipids decreased during late gestation, but the rate of ketogenesis from lactate remained high during this period.\n\nFinally, I will analyze the study on glyconeogenic and oxidative lactate utilization in skeletal muscle (Glyconeogenic and oxidative lactate utilization in skeletal muscle). This study found that the two primary fates of lactate in skeletal muscle are oxidation and glycogen synthesis (glyconeogenesis).\n\nConsidering all these studies, it is clear that the main fate of lactate that leaves muscle and enters the circulation is not conversion to urea in the liver, nor conversion to glucose in the heart. The study on metabolic fate of lactate after vigorous activity in the leopard frog suggests that most of the lactate accumulated by frogs seems to be recycled into muscle glycogen, whereas the studies on ketogenesis from lactate in rat liver during the perinatal period and glyconeogenic and oxidative lactate utilization in skeletal muscle suggest that oxidation is a quantitatively the most important means of disposing of lactate. Therefore, I will choose option D: uptake and oxidation by other tissues.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
