["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has a recent trauma to the right forearm, which is erythematous and fluctuant. This suggests that there is a break in the blood-vascular barrier, leading to an increase in permeability and subsequent edema. The text 'Regional cerebral blood flow in delayed brain swelling following x-irradiation of the right occipital lobe in the monkey' discusses a similar situation where a massive break in the blood-brain barrier leads to vasogenic edema. This is accompanied by an increase in CSF pressure, CSF lactic dehydrogenase and total protein, and clinical signs of increased intracranial pressure. With resolution of CSF pressure, there is a return to baseline of CSF chemistry and partial resolution of the other parameters. Therefore, it is likely that the primary mechanism of development of edema in this patient is 'separation of endothelial junctions'.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
