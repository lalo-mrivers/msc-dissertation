["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for a method to restrict the wrestler's caloric intake. The methods provided are all related to restricting food or snacks. The paper on alopecia in crash dieters provides insight into the effects of rigorous caloric restriction, which could be relevant to this scenario.

This suggests that the method should not involve restricting or monitoring food intake in some way.\n\nAmong the options provided, snapping himself with a rubber band when he eats a high-calorie snack (C) does not seem like a reasonable or effective way to restrict caloric intake.
