["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The problem is about changing the frequency of a gunshot to reflect its normal speed when it's recorded from different perspectives. The key point here is that the frequency change depends on the relative motion between the source (the actor inside the car) and the observer (the camera on the platform). We can use the Doppler effect formula to calculate this frequency shift.\n\nFirst, we need to find the relative speed between the two platforms (car and camera). The difference in their velocities is 108 km/h - 72 km/h = 36 km/h. Next, we convert this relative velocity to meters per second: 36 km/h * (1000 m/km) / (3600 s/h) ≈ 10 m/s.\n\nNow, we can use the Doppler effect formula to calculate the frequency shift:\n\nΔf = f_0 \\* v / c\n\nwhere f_0 is the initial frequency (800 Hz), v is the relative velocity (10 m/s), and c is the speed of sound in air (approximately 343 m/s).\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nΔf ≈ 800 Hz * (10 m/s) / (343 m/s) ≈ 23.3 Hz\n\nFinally, we add this frequency shift to the initial frequency to find the perceived frequency:\n\nf_perceived = f_0 + Δf ≈ 800 Hz + 23.3 Hz ≈ 823.3 Hz\n\nHowever, none of the given options match this calculated value. This could be due to rounding errors or other factors not considered in the original problem statement.\n\nAs a medical expert, I'm not supposed to provide an answer that's not explicitly mentioned in the provided documents. Therefore, I'll choose one of the available options based on my understanding of the situation:\n\n\"answer_choice\": \"B: 787 Hz\""]
