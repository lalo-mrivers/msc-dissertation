["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the net production of ATP via substrate-level phosphorylation in glycolysis. The study 'Oscillations in glycolysis: multifactorial quantitative analysis in muscle extract' provides information about the oscillatory pattern in glycolysis and the balance between the consumption of ATP associated with the phosphorylation of D-glucose and the net production of ATP resulting from the further catabolism of D-fructose 6-phosphate. The study 'ATP-producing and consuming processes of Ehrlich mouse ascites tumor cells in proliferating and resting phases' provides information about the extents of ATP-yielding and consuming processes during the proliferating and resting growth phase. Based on this information, we can conclude that substrate-level phosphorylation occurs in glycolysis.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
