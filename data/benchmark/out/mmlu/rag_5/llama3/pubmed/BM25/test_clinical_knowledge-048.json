["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about glycogen breakdown in exercising muscle. We need to find a relevant passage that talks about this process. After reviewing the provided documents, we can see that there are multiple mentions of glycogen breakdown and exercise. However, one specific passage stands out as being most relevant: 'Similar decrements in muscle glycogen levels were observed in both the non-exercising and exercising muscles at the end of the 90-min, exercise bout (P less than 0.05), despite significantly different activity profiles.' This suggests that glycogen breakdown occurs during exercise, regardless of whether the muscle is being used or not.\n\nAnother passage mentions ADP as a limiting factor for glycogen breakdown in Xenopus embryos. However, this is a different context and does not directly relate to human muscle metabolism during exercise.\n\nThere are no other passages that discuss glycogen breakdown specifically in the context of exercise.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that there is no specific activation mechanism mentioned in these documents that would trigger glycogen breakdown in exercising muscle.\", \"answer_choice\": D}"]
