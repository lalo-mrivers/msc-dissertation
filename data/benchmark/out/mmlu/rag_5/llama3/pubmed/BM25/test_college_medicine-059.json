["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents suggest that endurance training increases the muscle's capacity to oxidize fatty acids and carbohydrates. For example, the study on \\\"Effect of endurance training on the capacity of red and white skeletal muscle of mouse to oxidize carboxyl-14C-labelled palmitate\\\" shows that endurance training increased the fatty acid oxidation capacity (FAO) in both red and white muscles. Additionally, the study on \\\"Adaptations to endurance and low velocity resistance training performed in a sequence\\\" suggests that endurance training improves aerobic endurance measures, which is consistent with an increase in the muscle's ability to generate energy from fat and carbohydrates.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
