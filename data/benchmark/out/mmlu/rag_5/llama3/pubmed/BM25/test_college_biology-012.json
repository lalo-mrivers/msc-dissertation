["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"In Sweden, the red fox (Vulpes vulpes) severely limits populations of its prey, including hares. However, red fox populations are sometimes attacked by a fatal parasite, the mange mite. As mite population sizes increase at a given site, it is likely that red fox populations will decrease due to the negative impact of the parasite on their health and survival. This could potentially lead to an increase in hare populations as the main predator (foxes) is removed or reduced.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
