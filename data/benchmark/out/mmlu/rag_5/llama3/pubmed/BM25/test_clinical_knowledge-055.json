["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, we need to convert the person's weight from kilograms to grams. Since there are 1000 grams per kilogram, we multiply the weight by 1000: 62 kg * 1000 g/kg = 62,000 g. Next, we calculate the drug dose in grams by multiplying the dose rate (15 mg/kg) by the person's weight in kilograms and then converting milligrams to grams. Since there are 1000 milligrams per gram, we multiply the dose rate by 1000: 15 mg/kg * 1000 mg/g = 15,000 mg. Finally, we divide the total dose (in milligrams) by the person's weight in kilograms and then convert kilograms to grams: (15,000 mg) / (62 kg) * 1000 g/kg = 9.3 g.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
