["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks which of the following promotes glucose and amino acid uptake by muscle. From the provided documents, we can infer that insulin is the answer as it increases the uptake of alpha-aminoisobutyric acid ([14C]AIB) in lung slices (Influence of insulin on amino acid uptake by lung slices). Additionally, previous studies from our laboratory demonstrated that there is a difference in glucose metabolism by skeletal muscles from the burned versus unburned regions of the body. The data indicate that a mild thermal injury stimulates glucose utilization and enhances amino acid release by skeletal muscle from the burned region.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
