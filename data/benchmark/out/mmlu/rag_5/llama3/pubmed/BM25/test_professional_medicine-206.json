["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is experiencing malaise, muscle and joint pain, and fever 3 days after a cadaveric renal transplantation. The biopsy of the transplanted kidney shows intracellular inclusion bodies. Cyclosporine therapy is ongoing, but serum creatinine concentration has increased to 1.6 mg/dL. The presence of intracellular inclusion bodies suggests a viral infection, possibly cytomegalovirus (CMV) or herpesvirus.

Ganciclovir is an antiviral medication commonly used to treat CMV infections in transplant patients.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: Begin ganciclovir therapy\""]
