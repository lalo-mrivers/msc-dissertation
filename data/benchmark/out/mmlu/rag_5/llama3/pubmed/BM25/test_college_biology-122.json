["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the effect of low external pH on mitochondria. We can analyze the provided documents for clues. In 'The effect of ATP on calcium efflux in dialyzed barnacle muscle fibres.', we see that when Na+ and Ca2+ are removed from the external medium, there is a marked drop in the Ca2+ efflux in the presence of internal ATP. This suggests that changes in pH can affect mitochondrial activity.\n\nIn 'Conformational interconversion in protein crystals.', we find that lowering the pH causes structural changes in carbonmonoxy myoglobin crystals, which are monitored by Raman modes at 508 and 491 cm-1. This implies that changes in pH can cause conformational changes in proteins.\n\nThe other documents do not provide direct information about mitochondria or ATP production. However, they do show the effect of pH on sporicidal activity, the importance of pH for the disinfection of heat-sensitive medical equipment, and the relationship between pH and pleural symphysis. These findings suggest that pH can have significant effects on biological processes.\n\nGiven this analysis, we can consider the choices provided. Choices A, B, C, and D all relate to changes in pH affecting ATP production. However, choice A is unlikely because mitochondria pump H+ out of the matrix, not into it. Choices B and C are also unlikely because they do not take into account the direction of proton pumping.\n\nThe best explanation for the effect of low external pH on mitochondria is that it increases diffusion of H+ from the intermembrane space to the matrix (choice D). This allows for increased ATP production, which is observed in the experiment.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
