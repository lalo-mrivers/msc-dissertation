["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking which of the given options can act as an intracellular buffer to limit pH changes when the rate of glycolysis is high. We know from previous studies that glycolysis is influenced by the intracellular pH. The provided documents suggest that non-electrolytes or anions stimulate glycolysis by elevation of the intracellular pH, and that red cell glycolysis is influenced mainly by the intracellular pH rather than by the pH of the suspending medium. Therefore, we are looking for a substance that can increase the intracellular pH in response to high rates of glycolysis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"]
