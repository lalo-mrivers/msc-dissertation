["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about when muscle lactate production increases. From the documents provided, we can see that elevated muscle acidity and energy production during exhaustive exercise in humans (document 1) shows that muscle lactate concentration was the same at the end of Ex1 and Ex2, but the accumulation of lactate and net lactate release during Ex2 were reduced by 67 and 38%, respectively. This suggests that lactate production may be reduced when intense exercise is repeated. Additionally, document 3 discusses elevated muscle glycogen and anaerobic energy production during exhaustive exercise in man. It shows that the net lactate production was not related to initial muscle glycogen level. Document 4 states that rate of lactate production was unrelated to initial muscle glycogen level. From these studies, we can conclude that lactate production is not solely dependent on oxygen availability, but rather it may be influenced by other factors such as intense exercise or muscle glycogen levels.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: glycolysis is activated at the onset of exercise.\""]
