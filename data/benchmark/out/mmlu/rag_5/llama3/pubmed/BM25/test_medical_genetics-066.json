["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about population carrier screening. Population carrier screening aims to identify individuals who are carriers of a genetic disorder, but may or may not be affected by it themselves. Based on the provided documents, we can see that they discuss various genetic structures and disorders, but none of them specifically mention population carrier screening.\n\nHowever, we can make an educated guess about which disorder is not suitable for population carrier screening based on our understanding of these disorders. For instance, cystic fibrosis is a recessive disorder that affects the respiratory system, whereas Tay-Sachs disease is a lysosomal storage disorder caused by a deficiency of hexosaminidase A.\n\nOn the other hand, oculocutaneous albinism and sickle cell disease are autosomal recessive disorders that can be detected through population carrier screening. Therefore, based on our understanding of these genetic disorders, we can conclude that Tay-Sachs disease is not suitable for population carrier screening because it's a lysosomal storage disorder caused by a deficiency of hexosaminidase A, which is a different type of disorder compared to the others mentioned.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D: Tay-Sachs disease.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
