["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents describe the regulation of sarcoplasmic reticulum gene expression during cardiac and skeletal muscle development. It also discusses creatine's role in stimulating myofibrillar protein synthesis in skeletal and cardiac muscle cells. In 'Myosin synthesis increased by electrical stimulation of skeletal muscle cell cultures', it is mentioned that the increase in protein production is greater for contractile proteins such as myosin heavy chain than for total cellular protein. This suggests that myosin is an important contractile protein involved in muscle hypertrophy. Therefore, based on this information, we can conclude that the two principal contractile proteins found in skeletal muscle are actin and myosin.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
