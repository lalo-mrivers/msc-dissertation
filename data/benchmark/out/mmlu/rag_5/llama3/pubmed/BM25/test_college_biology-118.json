["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the technique used to integrate mouse cellsurface proteins and human cell-surface proteins along a fused mouse-human cell plasma membrane. The relevant documents describe different techniques such as lactoperoxidase-catalyzed iodination, loss of polypeptides labeled in situ by lactoperoxidase-catalyzed iodination, etc. However, the description of fusion of cells is not mentioned. Therefore, we need to look for a technique that involves fusion or integration of proteins from different cells.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
