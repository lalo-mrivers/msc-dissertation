["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the initial energy source for very high force contractions lasting 1-2 seconds. In isometric exercise, VO2 is linearly related to the force exerted up to at least 40% Tmax, and the energy required for the development of the tension is linearly related to the force exerted up to 33% Tmax, thereafter increasing disproportionately. This suggests that for high-force contractions, the initial energy source is likely from phosphocreatine stores or ATP stores, as these are the primary sources of high-energy phosphate bonds.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
