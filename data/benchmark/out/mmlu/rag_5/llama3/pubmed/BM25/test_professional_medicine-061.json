["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 17-year-old girl who has not had a menstrual period for 6 months. She is unconcerned about the lack of menses, but her mother brought her to the physician because of this issue. The patient's medical history shows that menarche occurred at age 12 years and regular periods continued until they became irregular 1 year ago. The patient appears emaciated, which suggests a possible underlying condition. Her BMI is 15 kg/m2, pulse is 54/min, and blood pressure is 80/50 mm Hg.
