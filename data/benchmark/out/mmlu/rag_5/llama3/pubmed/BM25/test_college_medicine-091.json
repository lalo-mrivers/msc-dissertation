["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the type of covalent bonds that link amino acids in a protein. We have multiple documents to analyze. The first document discusses amino acid composition in meteorites and doesn't provide information on covalent bonds between amino acids. The second document describes spontaneous somatic mutations and provides details on immunoglobulin heavy chains, but it's not relevant to the question. The third document talks about substitutions of a cysteine conserved among DNA cytosine methylases and discusses the role of this cysteine in forming covalent links with carbon 6 of target cytosine. However, this is specific to a particular enzyme and doesn't provide general information on covalent bonds between amino acids. The fourth document presents evidence for the presence of epsilon-(gamma-glutamic)lysine crosslinks in cellular proteins, which are covalent interactions formed directly by enzymatic catalysis. This suggests that covalent bonds can form between amino acids in proteins. The fifth document discusses hydrogen bonds in crystal structures of amino acids, peptides, and related molecules, but it doesn't provide information on the specific type of covalent bonds linking amino acids in a protein. Based on this analysis, we can conclude that peptide bonds are likely the answer.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
