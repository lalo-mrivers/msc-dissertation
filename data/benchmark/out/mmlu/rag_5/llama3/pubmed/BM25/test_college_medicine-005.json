["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the transport of fatty acids into mitochondria. From the provided documents, we can identify that fatty acids are transported by a carrier-mediated transport system with a Kt of 870 Î¼M in Nocardia asteroides (document 2). This suggests that fatty acids are transported intracellularly as free fatty acids. In document 3, it is mentioned that fatty acids are excellent respiratory substrates for mitochondria and their oxidation is coupled to the generation of high energy state of the mitochondrial membrane. This implies that fatty acids need to be transported into mitochondria.\n\nFrom the provided choices, option D (carnitine) is the most relevant as it is known to play a role in the transport of fatty acids into mitochondria. Carnitine is required for the transport of long-chain fatty acids across the inner mitochondrial membrane and is involved in their beta-oxidation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
