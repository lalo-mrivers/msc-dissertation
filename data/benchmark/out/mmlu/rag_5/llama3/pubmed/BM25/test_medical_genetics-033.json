["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The cross between two true breeding lines produces F1 offspring that are light blue. This suggests that one of the parents is carrying a recessive allele for flower color. The 1:2:1 ratio of dark blue to light blue to white flowers in the selfed progeny indicates that there are three genotypes represented: homozygous recessive, heterozygous, and homozygous dominant. The phenotypic ratio is consistent with codominance.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
