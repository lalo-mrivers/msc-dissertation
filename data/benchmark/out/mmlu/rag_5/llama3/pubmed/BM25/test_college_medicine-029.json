["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"A ventricular septal defect is a hole in the septum between the right and left ventricles. This allows oxygenated blood from the left ventricle to flow into the right ventricle, which increases the amount of oxygen in the right ventricle. Since the right ventricle pumps deoxygenated blood to the lungs, the percentage of oxygen in the right atrium would actually be higher.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
