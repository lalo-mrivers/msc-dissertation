["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The provided documents discuss biomechanics of sprint running, intermuscular coordination, respiratory muscle fatigue, and constituents of human muscle in isometric fatigue. The relevant information for this question is found in the 'Constituents of human muscle in isometric fatigue' document. According to this study, during isometric fatigue, changes in ATP and glycogen are insufficient to be held accountable for the development of fatigue. Changes in CP and lactate were large after fatigue at intermediate tensions, but those of CP were considered unlikely to be responsible for the fatigue. At tensions of 30-50% MVC the increase in lactate could be responsible for fatigue either directly or by indirect changes in pH; at higher and lower tensions the possibility that lactate is directly implicated in the development of fatigue seems remote.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
