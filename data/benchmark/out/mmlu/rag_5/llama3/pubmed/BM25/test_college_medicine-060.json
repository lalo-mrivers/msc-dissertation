["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about what determines metabolism. In the provided documents, there are several references to metabolic pathways and enzymes involved. The key concept here is that metabolism is influenced by genetic information, as proteins formed according to genetic material dictate their functions. For example, in 'Metabolism of phenol and resorcinol in Trichosporon cutaneum', the pathway starts with o-hydroxylation which is followed by ortho-ring fission, lactonization, and delactonization. This suggests that specific enzymes are involved in these reactions, which are determined by genetic information.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
