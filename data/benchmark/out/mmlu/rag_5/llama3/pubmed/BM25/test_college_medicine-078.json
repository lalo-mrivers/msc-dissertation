["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The scientist is stimulating a group of neurons in the hypothalamus and recording their membrane potential changes. Initially, there's a sharp rise in membrane potential (100mV) when stimulated for the first time. When trying another stimulation immediately after the first, there's no response. This suggests that the neurons are refractory or unresponsive to repeated stimulations of the same intensity. However, when increasing the amount of voltage supplied to the second shock, a similar response is observed again. This indicates that the refractoriness has been overcome by increasing the stimulus intensity.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
