["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the low intake of carbohydrate in the diet. In the relevant documents, there are several studies that mention the effect of different diets on macronutrient selection patterns and body weight gain in rats. Specifically, one study mentioned that rats given dietary choice gained less weight over 4 days than rats fed chow and showed reduced feed efficiency. This suggests that low carbohydrate intake may affect exercise performance or body weight gain.\n\nIn another study, it was found that high-fiber diet can play a significant role in the treatment of diabetes mellitus by increasing the viscosity of intestinal contents with slower small bowel transit time resulting in slow, but sustained absorption of glucose. This suggests that low carbohydrate intake may also affect the resting muscle pH or exercise performance.\n\nThe present studies examined the effects of adrenalectomy on nutrient selection patterns in rats over the 24-h period, as well as during the first 2 h of the nocturnal feeding cycle. Results indicate that high protein diet devoid of carbohydrate (HP) fed animals showed a significantly lower autophagic activity of the lysosomal system than LP fed animals.\n\nFrom these studies, it can be concluded that low intake of carbohydrates may affect exercise performance or body weight gain.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
