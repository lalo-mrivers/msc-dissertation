["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the human body's defense mechanism against environmental bacteria. We can look at the provided documents to find the relevant information. The first document talks about the rabbit appendix and its defense mechanism against adverse environmental effects of the appendix content. This suggests that there may be a similar mechanism in humans.
