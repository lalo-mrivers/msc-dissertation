["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about how the body compensates for increased environmental temperature. First, we need to identify relevant documents that discuss the effects of high environmental temperatures on the body. The first document discusses the effects of high and low environmental temperatures on the maternal and fetal toxicity of dinoseb in mice. It mentions that a 24 h exposure to 32 degrees C (high temperature) enhanced the effect of daily dinoseb treatments in pregnant mice, increasing maternal mortality, decreasing fetal body weight, and increasing frequency of fetal anomalies.\n\nThe second document discusses cardiac function in massively obese patients and the effect of weight loss. Although it does not directly discuss environmental temperatures, it provides information about how the heart compensates for increased blood volume by increasing stroke volume and cardiac work to provide increased cardiac output.\n\nThe third document is about measuring and evaluating changes in body temperature in humans. It discusses thermoregulation (skin and body temperature) and heat exchange in humans engaged in physical work of different types and intensity in variable environmental temperatures.\n\nThe fourth document discusses the effects of environmental temperature, diet dilution, and treadmill running on voluntary food intake, body composition, and endocrine organ mass in male rats. It mentions that increased temperature reduced body weight attained and total food intake, but did not significantly affect food intake.\n\nThe fifth document is about the influence of the menstrual cycle on the sweating response measured by direct calorimetry in women exposed to warm environmental conditions. It discusses how the internal set point temperature of resting women shifted to a higher value during the luteal phase compared to the follicular phase.\n\nBased on this information, we can conclude that the body compensates for increased environmental temperature by increasing heart rate.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
