["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents discuss various aspects of cardiac anatomy, surgery, and physiology. The anatomical substrates of Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome describe the atrioventricular junctions being serially sectioned, which helps identify accessory atrioventricular connections. This information suggests that the right atrioventricular valve is not a semilunar valve, as it does not deal with pulmonary trunk blood flow. Papillary muscles prevent leaflets from evertng during diastole, but this does not apply to the right atrioventricular valve. The valve is open during systole and prevents blood returning from the pulmonary trunk during heart relaxation.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
