As the hospital's emergency department is concerned with patient safety, it is essential to assess the physician's fitness for duty. The first step would be to approach the physician and ask if he is sober. However, this may not be sufficient as the smell of alcohol on his breath suggests otherwise. Therefore, a more comprehensive evaluation is needed to ensure patient safety.\n\nThe next step would be to request that the physician submit to a blood sample test to determine his blood alcohol concentration (BAC). This would provide a clear indication of whether the physician is intoxicated and whether he poses a risk to patients.\n\nConsidering the physician's skillset, talent, and clean record, it is unlikely that he has any substance or alcohol use disorder. However, it is crucial to prioritize patient safety above all else.\n\nThe other options are not suitable as they may compromise patient safety.
