The question is about the location where the respiratory tract is crossed by the isthmus of the thyroid gland. From Mucoepidermoid carcinoma of the thyroid gland, we know that the isthmus is part of the thyroid gland and is located between the two lobes. In Thyroid gland and carcinoma of the hypopharyngeal-laryngeal region, it is mentioned that the thyroid gland harbours many diseases which require a surgical treatment; the gland may also be involved by some secondary malignant neoplasms. This type of involvement by laryngeal and hypopharyngeal cancers is more often due to direct extension rather than metastases. The relevant passage does not mention the location where the respiratory tract is crossed by the isthmus of the thyroid gland.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: tracheal rings\"\n}"]
