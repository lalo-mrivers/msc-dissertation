["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 72-year-old woman with a 2-month history of painless swelling of both ankles, shortness of breath with exertion, and when lying down. She has been awakened from sleep by shortness of breath. The key findings are the presence of crackles at both lung bases on pulmonary examination, a regular rhythm and a soft S3 on cardiac examination, and a grade 3/6 holosystolic murmur radiating to the axilla. Given these findings, I suspect that the patient has Felty's syndrome, which is characterized by rheumatoid arthritis, leucopenia, and an enlarged spleen, as well as the presence of a diffuse infiltrating soft tissue mass involving the entire right orbit. The most likely diagnosis would be orbital lymphoma in a patient with Felty's syndrome.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
