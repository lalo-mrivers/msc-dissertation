["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about what happens during swallowing. We have several documents that describe different aspects of the process, including Superior orbicularis oris muscle activity in children with and without cleft lip and palate, Effects of lingual nerve and chewing cortex stimulation upon activity of the swallowing neurons located in the region of the hypoglossal motor nucleus, [Subclinical swallowing disorder in patients with abnormal sensation in the throat], Salivary stimulus and swallowing reflex in man, and Oro-pharyngeal sensitivity and elicitation of swallowing in man. From these documents, we can infer that the muscles involved in swallowing are likely to contract during this process. Specifically, the cricopharyngeus muscle is mentioned as contracting during swallowing. Therefore, option B is the correct answer.\", \"answer_choice\": B}"]
