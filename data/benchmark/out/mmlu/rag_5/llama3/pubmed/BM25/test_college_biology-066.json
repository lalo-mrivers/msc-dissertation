["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the first point of entry of water at the roots of a monocot plant. We need to look for information that describes the structure of the root and its function. The relevant document is 'Effect of D2O on maize plasmalemma ATPase and electron transport coupled proton pumping.' According to this document, heavy water (D2O) has been used as a putative inhibitor of the plasma membrane H(+)-ATPase and the plasma membrane redox system. It also mentions that the roots were transiently depolarized after the addition of heavy water in concentrations above 5%. This suggests that the first point of entry of water at the roots of the plant is through the plasma membrane.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B\n}"]
