["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking which option is most consistent with the hypothesis that cliff nesting is adaptive in this goose species. Since all chicks must make their way to the ocean soon after hatching, it's clear that the key factor is the mortality rate of the chicks from cliff nests due to falling. The relevant documents mention CSD (cortical spreading depression) and depth avoidance in rats and chicks, but these don't seem directly related to the question. The mention of Mioctenopsylla arctica arctica being present in kittiwake nests on Spitzbergen is also not relevant. However, we do have information about gulls and their nesting habits. Specifically, the Herring gulls (Larus argentatus) nest both in slope and ground colonies and on cliff ledges. Like the Kittiwake (CULLEN 1957), the cliff-nesting pairs still accept other chicks after the 1st week of life. Gulls in slope and ground colonies, however, attack those chicks older than 4 days in close proximity to their nests (TINBERGEN 1936). This suggests that cliff nesting is a way for gulls to avoid infanticide by predators. Similarly, it's possible that the goose species in question has evolved to nest on cliffs as a way to increase the survival rate of their chicks.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
