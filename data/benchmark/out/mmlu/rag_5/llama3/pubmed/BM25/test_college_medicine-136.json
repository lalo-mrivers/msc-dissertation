["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the characteristics of fast-twitch fibres. We can look at the relevant documents to answer this question. The first document describes the myosin light chain patterns of individual fast and slow-twitch fibres of rabbit muscles. It states that fast-twitch white fibres, as well as fast-twitch red fibres, reveal a myosin light chain pattern characteristic of 'fast-type' myosin with three light chains of apparent molecular weights of 22,300 (LC1), 18,400 (LC2) and 16,000 (LC3). There is no information about mitochondria or ATPase activity in this document. The second document describes the activities of malate dehydrogenase, 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase and fructose-1,6-diphosphatase with regard to metabolic subpopulations of fast- and slow-twitch fibres in rabbit muscles. It states that fast-twitch fibres in psoas muscle represent a heterogeneous population with regard to activities of malate dehydrogenase (MDH) as well as of 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase (HAD). There is no information about mitochondria or ATPase activity in this document. The third document describes time-dependent effects on contractile properties, fibre population, myosin light chains and enzymes of energy metabolism in intermittently and continuously stimulated fast-twitch muscles of the rabbit. It states that increases in time to peak of isometric twitch contraction were observed without parallel changes in the pattern of myosin light chains or alterations in the distribution of slow and fast fibres as discernible by the histochemical ATPase reaction. There is no information about mitochondria or ATPase activity in this document. The fourth document describes sulfate-reducing anaerobic bacteria in human feces. It has nothing to do with rabbit muscles or fibre types. Therefore, we cannot find any relevant information in this document. Considering all the documents, it seems that there is no direct information about mitochondria or ATPase activity for fast-twitch fibres.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: a relatively large number of mitochondria and high ATPase activity.\""]
