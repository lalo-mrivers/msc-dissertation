["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the cell type that would arise from a stem cell in Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML). According to the provided documents, AML is characterized by myeloid progenitor cells becoming rapidly dividing and retaining their semi-stem cell state. This information is found in the [Specific xenogenous antiserum to cells of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) in blastic crisis] document.\n\nIn this context, it can be inferred that the stem cell is a myeloid stem cell, which would give rise to different types of blood cells such as platelets and granulocytes. Therefore, based on the characteristics of AML, the correct answer would be B: Platelet.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
