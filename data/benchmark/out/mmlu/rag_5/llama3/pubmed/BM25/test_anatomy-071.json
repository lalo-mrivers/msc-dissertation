["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the provided documents, we can see that substance P is involved in nerve action potential propagation. It also seems to promote invasion of distal parts of nerve terminals. Acetylcholine is mentioned as an excitatory agent for intradental sensory units. Kainic acid blocks synaptic transmission across the giant synapse of the squid. These findings suggest that substance P and acetylcholine might be involved in transmission of nerve impulses, but kainic acid does not have a direct impact on muscle transmission. The remaining options are not relevant to this question based on the provided documents.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
