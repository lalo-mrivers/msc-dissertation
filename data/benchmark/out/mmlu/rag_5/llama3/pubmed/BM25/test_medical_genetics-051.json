["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking how many fragments a restriction enzyme would cleave a double-stranded bacteriophage with a genome size of 5,000 bp into. The restriction enzyme recognizes a specific 4 base sequence in DNA. Since the recognition site is 4 bases long, it will be present 1250 times (5000/4) in the 5000 bp genome. Therefore, the enzyme would cleave the phage DNA into approximately 1250 fragments.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: about 50\""]
