["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about a palpable left parasternal impulse. We need to look for relevant information from the given documents that can help us answer this question. From the first document, we learn that right parasternal scanning was used to diagnose dilatation of the ascending aorta. This suggests that the left parasternal region is involved in diagnosing cardiac conditions. In the third document, 'The left-fascicular blocks (\"hemiblocks\")', we see that the anatomical variations of the left ventricular impulse conduction system can affect the electrocardiographic diagnosis and therapy. This implies that the left parasternal region may be related to left ventricular function. Finally, from the last document, 'Thrombus within a submitral left ventricular aneurysm: diagnosis on cross sectional echocardiography', we learn that a palpable left parasternal impulse can be related to a submitral left ventricular aneurysm.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
