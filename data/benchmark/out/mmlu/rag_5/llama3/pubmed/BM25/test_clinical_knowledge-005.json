["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the effect of an increasing number of sprints on the physiological parameters. The relevant document is the one discussing maximal-intensity intermittent exercise: effect of recovery duration. According to this study, during the initial acceleration period from 0-15 m, running speed decreased with the shortest rest periods (R30). This suggests that anaerobic energy production may be involved. Additionally, oxygen uptake measured during rest periods increased with shorter recovery durations, indicating an increasing demand for aerobic metabolism.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
