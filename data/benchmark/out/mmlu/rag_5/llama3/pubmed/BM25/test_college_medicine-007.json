["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question states that DFP binds to the active site of acetylcholinesterase (ACE) in the synapses of neurons. When DFP binds to ACE, the ACE enzyme is rendered permanently inactive. This makes DFP a potent toxin, with lethal amounts at less than 100 mg. The key point here is that once DFP binds to ACE, it renders the enzyme permanently inactive. This suggests that the interaction between DFP and ACE is an irreversible one.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
