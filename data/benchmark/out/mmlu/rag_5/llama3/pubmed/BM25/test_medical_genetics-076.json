["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about a condition caused by a trinucleotide (triplet) repeat expansion. Based on the provided documents, we can see that myotonic dystrophy, spino-bulbar muscular atrophy, and fragile-X syndrome are all caused by expansions of trinucleotide repeats. Huntington disease is also known to be caused by an expansion of a CAG repeat, which is a type of trinucleotide repeat. Therefore, we can eliminate options A (cystic fibrosis), B (Duchenne muscular dystrophy), and D (osteogenesis imperfecta) as they are not caused by trinucleotide repeat expansions. The correct answer must be one of the remaining options.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
