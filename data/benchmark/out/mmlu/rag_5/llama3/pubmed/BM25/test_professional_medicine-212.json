["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has a history of varying physical symptoms with no definitive causes found despite extensive diagnostic studies. She gives dramatic and exaggerated descriptions of her present and past symptoms and makes conflicting statements about her history. This suggests that the patient may be using somatic symptoms to express underlying psychological distress.\n\nThe patient's behavior is similar to that described in the first document, where a woman used physical symptoms to cope with emotional distress. The patient also has a history of hospitalizations and surgical explorations, which may be related to her psychological distress rather than an actual medical condition.\n\nGiven this information, it seems likely that the patient's symptoms are not caused by an occult medical disorder, but rather are related to her psychological state.\n\nThe patient's behavior is consistent with somatic symptom disorder, where physical symptoms are used to express emotional distress. Conversion disorder may also be a possibility, as the patient has a history of dramatic and exaggerated descriptions of her symptoms.\n\nHistrionic personality disorder may also be considered, as the patient has a long history of hospitalizations and consultations with many physicians, which may indicate a tendency towards seeking attention through her physical symptoms.\n\nHowever, based on the information provided, I believe that somatic symptom disorder is the most likely diagnosis.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
