["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks which process is NOT used to modify protein structure after translation has occurred. Based on the provided documents, we can identify three processes that modify protein structure: lipidation (mentioned in 'Some applications of the phased translation function in macromolecular structure determination'), glycosylation (not explicitly mentioned but implied by the discussion of mRNA and ribosomes), and phosphorylation (also not explicitly mentioned but a common post-translational modification). The remaining option, attachment of more amino acids via peptide bonds, is actually part of the translation process itself, as it involves adding new amino acids to the growing protein chain. Therefore, this process cannot be considered as modifying the protein structure after translation has occurred.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
