["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question states that the X-linked recessive disorder is in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. This means that the gene frequency of A1 in females = 0.5(a-1 + b-1). Since the incidence of affected males is 1 in 100, this implies that the gene frequency of A1 in males is 0.01 (or 1%). As the disorder is X-linked recessive, heterozygous females are carriers and unaffected. The expected frequency of homozygous female carriers would be half the frequency of affected males, which is 0.005 (or 1 in 200). Since this is an equilibrium state, the gene frequency of A1 in females = 0.5(a-1 + b-1) implies that the frequency of A1 in females is also 0.005. Therefore, the expected incidence of affected homozygous females would be 0.005 (or 1 in 200).\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
