["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about blood flow between contractions of the left ventricle. The relevant documents provide information on vasodilation induced by brief isometric contractions (document 3) and the relationship between force-time integral (duration of contraction x peak tension) and blood flow (document 1). There is no mention of atrial contractions, vessel contraction or relaxation, or right ventricle relaxation in these documents. Therefore, the answer must be related to arterial properties.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
