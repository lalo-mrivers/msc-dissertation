["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents provided describe the activity of glycolysis enzymes in different tissues and organisms. The key point to note is that phosphofructokinase is mentioned as an enzyme involved in glycolysis in various studies. In [Activity of glycolysis key enzymes...], it is stated that the activity of phosphofructokinase lowers significantly under acute renal insufficiency, suggesting that this enzyme is mainly localized in certain subcellular structures of the kidneys. Similarly, in [Glycolysis in the eye tissues...], the activity of phosphofructokinase was found to be higher than in other eye tissues, specifically in the retina. This suggests that phosphofructokinase is likely located in the cytoplasm rather than a specific organelle like the mitochondrion or nucleus. The remaining options are less plausible given the context.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
