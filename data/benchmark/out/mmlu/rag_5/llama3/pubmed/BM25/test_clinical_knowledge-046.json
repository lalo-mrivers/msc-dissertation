["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the ratio of purines to pyrimidines in a double stranded DNA molecule. The provided documents are about amino acid catalyzed condensation of purines and pyrimidines with 2-deoxyribose, polyadenylic acid-polyuridylic acid (poly A : U), iodination-deiodination, and the role of exocyclic amino groups of conserved purines in hammerhead ribozyme cleavage. These documents do not provide direct information about the ratio of purines to pyrimidines in DNA. However, they do mention the formation of derivatives of purines and pyrimidines through condensation reactions with 2-deoxyribose and the addition of purines or pyrimidines to alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl compounds. This suggests that the ratio of purines to pyrimidines in DNA may be variable, depending on the specific sequence of bases.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A: variable.\""]
