["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the process of loading sugars into the phloem for transport. From the evidence document 'Evidence for a plasma membrane proton pump in phloem cells of higher plants', we know that metabolic energy is required for the loading of sucrose into the phloem and translocation of sugars throughout the plant. The proton electrochemical gradient generated by a plasma membrane proton pump (H(+)-ATPase) is thought to provide energy for these processes. This suggests that the process requires ATP.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
