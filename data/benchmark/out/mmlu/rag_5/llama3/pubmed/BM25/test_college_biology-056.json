["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about nerve outgrowth from a developing neuron. We know that growth cones are highly motile and adhesive structures, leading to maintain and promote neurite outgrowth. The extension of microspikes is crucial for the movement of the growth cone forward. Cytochalasin B exposure at this stage can affect microfilaments in the microspike. Therefore, we need to analyze how cytochalasin B affects microfilaments.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C: microfilaments in the microspike to undergo reversible depolymerization\""]
