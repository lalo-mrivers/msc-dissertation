["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about mapping of human chromosomes. None of the provided documents explicitly mention the number of linkage groups or the distribution of DNA on the chromosomes. However, document 1 mentions the study of rDNA sites and their correlation with frequency of satellite association, which is relevant to chromosomal mapping. Document 3 discusses autoradiographic survey of local metabolic rate with (14C)deoxyglucose, but it does not relate to chromosomal mapping either. The other documents are also unrelated to the question. Therefore, we need to rely on general knowledge and medical literature to find the correct answer.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
