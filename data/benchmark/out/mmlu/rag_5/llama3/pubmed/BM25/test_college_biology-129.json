["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the cellular uptake of cholesterol. The relevant documents discuss the metabolism of high density lipoprotein (HDL) and low density lipoprotein (LDL) by cultured normal human fibroblasts, the uptake of cholesterol from serum and cholesterol-phospholipid dispersions by isolated rat hepatocytes in vitro, and the rate constants for the uptake of cholesterol from various intestinal and serum lipoprotein fractions by the liver of the rat in vivo. The documents suggest that cellular uptake of LDL involves binding to cell-surface receptors followed by internalization through endosome formation. However, there is no evidence suggesting a direct role for adhesion plaques or receptor-mediated endocytosis specifically in cholesterol uptake from LDL.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
