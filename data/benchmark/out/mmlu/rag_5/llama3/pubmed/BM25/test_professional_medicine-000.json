She had a retroperitoneal hemorrhage; anticoagulant therapy was temporarily discontinued, and she underwent placement of an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter. The patient's symptoms started after discharge from the hospital, 2 weeks ago. The sensation is described as tingling and numbness of her left thigh, which has improved somewhat during the past week.

This suggests a compression or irritation of a nerve root or branch, possibly related to the IVC filter placement or the hematoma.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
