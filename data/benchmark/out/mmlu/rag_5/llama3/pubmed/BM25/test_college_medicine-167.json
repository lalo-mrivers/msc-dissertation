["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"After reviewing the documents, I found that the genetics of C.elegans sex determination was discussed. The paper mentioned that adult hermaphrodites have approximately 15-fold more tra-2 RNA than adult males. This suggests that there is a difference in the expression of the gene depending on the sex of the individual. Additionally, the study mentioned that the sex specificity of tra-2 RNAs is not dictated by the pathway of sex determination that has been established by genetic experiments. This implies that there may be an additional factor influencing the expression of the gene.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
