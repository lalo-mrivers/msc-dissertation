["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents discuss genetic structures and eukaryotic genes. In the first document, it is mentioned that all vertebrate globin genes contain two introns, while plant globin genes contain three. This suggests that introns can occur in different numbers depending on the species. The question asks which of the given options is NOT a characteristic of introns. Option A states that they occur only in eukaryotes, but this is not true as introns are also found in plants. Therefore, we can eliminate option A. Options B and C describe typical characteristics of introns, so these cannot be correct answers. The last option D is about the processing of the primary transcript during gene expression, which is a different topic. Based on this reasoning, the correct answer must be one of the above-mentioned options.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
