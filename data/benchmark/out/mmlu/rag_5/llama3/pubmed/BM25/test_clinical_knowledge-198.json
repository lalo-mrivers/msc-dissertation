["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The provided documents seem unrelated to the question about maximum sustainable power. However, upon closer examination of the problem statement, it appears that this is actually a medical question related to muscle fiber conduction velocity and its relationship to muscle glycogen content. The relevant document is 'Improved techniques for measuring muscle fiber conduction velocity'. This paper discusses various techniques for estimating muscle fiber conduction velocity and their performance in different conditions. It suggests that some of these techniques are more accurate than others, but it does not provide direct information about the maximum sustainable power.\n\nThe other documents seem unrelated to this question. The 'An assessment of the maximum sustainable yield of ivory from African elephant populations' document discusses population dynamics and harvesting strategies for elephants, while the 'Maximum sustainable yield of a nonlinear population model with continuous age structure' document deals with age-structured population models. The 'The monitoring of biological effects: the separation of natural changes from those induced by pollution' document discusses the impact of pollution on fish populations.\n\nFinally, the 'Resistance of internal and external parasites to antiparasitic drugs' document is not relevant to this question at all.\n\nTherefore, based on this analysis, we can conclude that there is no direct information about the maximum sustainable power in any of these documents. However, one might infer from the discussion of muscle fiber conduction velocity that high muscle glycogen content might be beneficial for performance, but this is purely speculative and not supported by evidence.\", \n\"answer_choice\": D"]
