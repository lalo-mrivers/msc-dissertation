["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The passage highlights the importance of tandem repeat polymorphisms, specifically microsatellite polymorphisms, for large-scale linkage mapping projects. It also mentions that base substitution RFLPs are unlikely to overtake tandem repeat markers without methods that allow typing at two or three times the rate. In the context of human DNA polymorphisms, microsatellite polymorphisms have been shown to be highly informative and can be typed at a higher rate than base substitution RFLPs. Given this information, it is likely that simple tandem repeat polymorphisms in humans are most useful for large-scale linkage mapping projects.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
