["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for the relative risk of death from a specific type of cancer in individuals who take Drug X compared to those who don't. We can calculate this by comparing the number of deaths from this type of cancer among individuals who took Drug X (100) to those who didn't (100). Since there are no differences in the number of deaths between the two groups, we can conclude that the relative risk is equal. This means that taking Drug X does not increase or decrease the risk of death from this type of cancer.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
