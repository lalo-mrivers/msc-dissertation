["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the products of ADP degradation that increase in concentration in blood during multiple sprint sports. We need to find a relevant study that discusses ADP degradation and its products. We can start by looking at the first study, 'Adenine nucleotide degradation in the thoroughbred horse with increasing exercise duration'. The study mentions that adenine nucleotide (AN) degradation has been shown to occur during intense exercise in the horse and in man, at or close to the point of fatigue. It also discusses the formation of IMP as a result of a sudden rise in ADP concentration.\n\nThe next step is to find another relevant study that discusses ADP degradation. We can look at the third study, 'A mechanism of K-insensitive, ouabain-dependent liberation of Na+ from the cell during an increase in ADP intracellular concentration'. This study shows that the increase in ADP/ATP ratio does not change the Na+, K+-ATPase affinity to K+ ions and does not result in the Na-activated, K-independent ATPase reaction.\n\nFrom these studies, we can conclude that ADP degradation results in the formation of IMP, hypoxanthine, and uric acid. Therefore, the answer is A: Ammonia, hypoxanthine and uric acid.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
