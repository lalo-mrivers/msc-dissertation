The patient's temperature is normal, blood pressure is slightly elevated, pulse is rapid, and respirations are normal.\n\nThe patient has no change in weight since his last examination 9 months ago, which suggests that his muscle weakness is not due to malnutrition or wasting disease.\n\nThe patient's symptoms started shortly after a camping trip, and he had been careful with sunscreen application. This suggests that the patient's symptoms may be related to an environmental exposure rather than an inherited condition.\n\nBased on these findings, dermatomyositis is the most likely diagnosis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
