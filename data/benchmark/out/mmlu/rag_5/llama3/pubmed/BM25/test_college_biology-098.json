["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the polytene chromosomes seen in Drosophila silvarentis with the aid of a light microscope. We need to analyze the relevant documents to find the information related to polytene chromosomes. The first document mentions electron microscopic band-interband pattern of polytene chromosomes in Drosophila nasuta albomicans, which suggests that polytene chromosomes are formed by repeated rounds of DNA replication followed by nuclear division (C). The second document talks about characterization of a Drosophila protein associated with boundaries of transcriptionally active chromatin, but it doesn't provide information about the origin of polytene chromosomes. The third document discusses ultrastructural analysis of polytene chromatin of Drosophila melanogaster, which provides insight into the structure and function of polytene chromosomes, but again doesn't provide information about their origin. The fourth document talks about positive and negative birefringence in chromosomes, which is a property of DNA organization, not directly related to polytene chromosomes. Finally, the fifth document discusses the faint band/interband region 28C2 to 28C4-5(-) of the Drosophila melanogaster salivary gland polytene chromosomes being rich in transcripts, but this is also not directly relevant to the origin of polytene chromosomes.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
