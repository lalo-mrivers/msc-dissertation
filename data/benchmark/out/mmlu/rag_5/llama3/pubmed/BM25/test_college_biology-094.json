["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the evidence provided, we know that the transforming gene of avian sarcoma virus (ASV) encodes a protein associated with a phosphoprotein. This protein is denoted as pp60. According to serological, biochemical and genetic criteria, this protein is encoded in src. The putative product of src can be immunoprecipitated by antisera obtained from rabbits bearing tumors induced by ASV. Phosphorylation of pp60 could be accomplished in vitro with extracts of ASV-infected cells. A temperature-sensitive conditional mutation in src had no demonstrable effect on either the production or stability of pp60 in the infected cell, but phosphorylation of the protein was temperature-sensitive.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: Tyrosine kinase\"\n}"]
