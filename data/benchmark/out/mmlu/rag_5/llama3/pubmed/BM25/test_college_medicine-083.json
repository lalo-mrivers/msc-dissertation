["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about peripheral muscle fatigue during multiple sprint activities. We need to look for information related to sprinting and muscle fatigue. From the provided documents, we can see that there are studies on biomechanics of sprint running, intermuscular coordination in a sprint push-off, respiratory muscle fatigue, EMG and mechanical changes during sprint starts at different front block obliquities, and constituents of human muscle in isometric fatigue. Among these, only one study (Constituents of human muscle in isometric fatigue) provides information related to peripheral muscle fatigue. According to this study, an accumulation of lactate could be responsible for fatigue either directly or by indirect changes in pH at tensions of 30-50% MVC.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
