["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The modification is changing the sequence of an RNA strand that produces a transmembrane protein. The original strand codes for a potassium channel facilitating potassium entry into muscle cells. To predict the outcome, we need to consider the effects of this modification on the translated protein. Since the modified sequence is very similar to the original one, it's likely that the modification doesn't significantly alter the reading frame or introduce premature stop codons. Therefore, the new protein will most likely be similar in size and function to the original one. However, since the modified sequence has a different nucleotide composition, there might be some changes in the tertiary structure or binding properties of the protein, which could affect its functionality.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B: Production of a similar-sized but dysfunctional protein\""]
