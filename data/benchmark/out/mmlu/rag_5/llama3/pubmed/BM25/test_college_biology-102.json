["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the stabilization of an alpha helix structure in a protein. From the provided documents, we can see that hydrogen bonding plays a crucial role in stabilizing the structure of proteins. Specifically, document 1 mentions that hydrogen bonds are present in helices and that side-chain to backbone hydrogen bonds are clustered at helix-capping positions. Document 3 also suggests that hydrogen bonding interactions stabilize helix formation. Therefore, it is likely that hydrogen bonding between peptide backbone atoms plays a significant role in stabilizing the unique coiled structure of an alpha helix.\",\n\"answer_choice\": A"]
