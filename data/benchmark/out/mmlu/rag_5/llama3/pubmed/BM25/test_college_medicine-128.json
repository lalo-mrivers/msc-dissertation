["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the initial breakdown of glycogen in muscle. We are given several documents related to enzymes involved in glycolysis. From the document [On the enzymatic breakdown of tripolyphosphate and diphosphate in minced meat. V. Change in the diphosphatase activity of muscle post mortem (author's transl)], we see that the diphosphatase (DPase) activity of minced bovine muscle decreased during storage, but increased during the breakdown of DP. This suggests that glycogen breakdown in muscle initially results in the formation of DPs. From this information, we can deduce that glucose-1,6-diphosphate is the correct answer.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
