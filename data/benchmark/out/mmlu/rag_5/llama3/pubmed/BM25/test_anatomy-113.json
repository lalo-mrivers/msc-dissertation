["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking which structure allows gas exchange in the lungs. Gas exchange occurs when oxygen and carbon dioxide are exchanged between the air sacs and the blood. In birds, the caudal thoracic air sac makes a major contribution to total gas exchange between air sacs and blood. The primary bronchus is blocked in some studies of pulmonary gas exchange. In the context of human lungs, gas exchange occurs in alveoli. Therefore, it can be concluded that the correct answer is A: Alveoli.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
