["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking how glucose is transported into muscle cells. The relevant documents mention glucose's role in stimulating lipogenic enzyme gene expression in cultured white adipose tissue and its possible involvement in the regulated transfer of a cytosolic protein into the vacuole. However, these documents do not provide direct information on glucose transport in muscle cells. A quick scan of the documents reveals that one document discusses axonal transport of actin, which is not directly related to glucose transport. Another document mentions glucose 6-phosphate as a metabolite involved in the stimulation of lipogenic enzyme gene expression, but this does not provide insight into glucose transport. The remaining documents discuss different topics such as proteolytic degradation and neuronotrophic factors. Therefore, it appears that there is no direct information on glucose transport in muscle cells within these documents.\", \n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
