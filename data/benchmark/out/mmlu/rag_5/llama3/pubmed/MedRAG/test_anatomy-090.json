["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Palatine shelf elevation is studied in 'Palate morphogenesis. III. Changes in cell shape and orientation during shelf elevation.' The process of palate shelf elevation has been analyzed by light microscopy in mouse embryos cultured in vitro. The observations presented correlate changes in cell shape and orientation in the palate with the morphogenetic movement of the shelf. According to this study, in addition to any physical-chemical force elevating the shelf an active contraction of specific palate cells could also aid the process. This suggests that palatine shelf elevation is not solely due to the effect of a single factor, but rather a combination of processes.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
