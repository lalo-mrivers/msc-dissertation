["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the principal contractile proteins found in skeletal muscle. We can look at the documents to find the answer. Contractile protein isoforms in muscle development talks about families of very similar isoforms, and The ultrastructure of striated muscle describes the spatial arrangement of major cytoplasmic components in skeletal muscle. Comparison of the localization of several muscle proteins in relaxed and contracted myofibrils also mentions the proteins found in myofibrils. Finally, Preparation and properties of vertebrate smooth-muscle myofibrils and actomyosin talks about the contractile systems of striated muscles. From these documents, we can conclude that the two principal contractile proteins are actin and myosin.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B\n}"]
