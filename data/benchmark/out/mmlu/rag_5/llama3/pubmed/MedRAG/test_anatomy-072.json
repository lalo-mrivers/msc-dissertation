["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents provide information about the structure of spinal cord. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis document mentions degeneration of cortico-spinal tracts, loss of spinal neurons, and gliosis. Spinal branching of pyramidal tract neurons in monkey shows that PT neurons sending axons directly to motor nuclei innervating distal forelimb muscles have less branching. The other documents provide information about ubiquitin deposits in spinal motor neurons and choline acetyltransferase messenger RNA distribution in human spinal cord. Morphology of synaptic apparatus of the frog's spinal cord suggests that synapses are distributed more on dendrites than neuron bodies. Given this information, it is likely that motor neuron cell bodies are located in... Lamina IX.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
