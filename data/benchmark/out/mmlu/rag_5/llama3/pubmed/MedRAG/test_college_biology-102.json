["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The passage mentions the two-stranded alpha-helical coiled-coil as an ideal model for studying protein stability and subunit interactions. It is mentioned that the formation and stability of this coiled-coil depends on peptide concentration due to the monomer-dimer equilibrium. This suggests that the unique coiled structure of an alpha helix in a protein is primarily attributed to inter-chain hydrophobic interactions rather than hydrogen bonding between the peptide backbone atoms.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
