["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the descendants of a plant that has spontaneously doubled its chromosome number. This doubling likely occurred to restore meiotic stability, as mentioned in 'Developments in the meiotic analysis of hybrids. II. Amended models for tetraploids'. According to this document, when the chromosome number doubles, it can allow chromosomes to pair normally during meiosis. Since the question is asking about descendants, we consider the reproductive success of these doubled plants. With restored meiotic stability, the doubled plant can backcross with its parental species, which supports option C.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
