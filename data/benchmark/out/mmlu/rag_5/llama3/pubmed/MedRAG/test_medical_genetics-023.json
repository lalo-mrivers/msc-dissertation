["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about homeobox sequences. The provided documents discuss the nucleotide sequences of homeobox genes in mouse, Xenopus, and vertebrates. Homeobox genes are conserved across species, with similarities in their DNA binding motifs. This suggests that homeobox sequences are present in the genome of many animal species.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
