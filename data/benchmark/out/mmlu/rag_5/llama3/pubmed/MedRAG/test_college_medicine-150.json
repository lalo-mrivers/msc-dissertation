["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the mechanism that eventually suppresses the stress response triggered by CRF release from the hypothalamus. We know that chronic central administration of CRF leads to decreased food intake and suppression of body-weight gain, suggesting that CRF can have prolonged effects on reproductive function. However, we also see in the 'Studies on fast feedback mechanisms by endogenous glucocorticoids' article that CRF activity in the hypothalamus is governed by a fast feedback, rate-sensitive mechanism. This implies that once cortisol levels are elevated due to CRF release, it can negatively feedback to suppress further CRF release and subsequent cortisol production.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C\n}"]
