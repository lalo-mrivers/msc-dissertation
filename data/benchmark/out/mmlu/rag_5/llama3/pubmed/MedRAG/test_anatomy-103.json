["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the development of bones through endochondral ossification. This process involves the formation of bone from cartilage. In the provided documents, we can find information about this topic. For instance, in 'Skeletal development and bone functional adaptation', it states that 'the results of many previous computer models for endochondral ossification... support the view that simple stress-related mathematical algorithms or \"construction rules\" can be used to emulate normal skeletal development and architectural construction.' This suggests that endochondral ossification is a process involved in bone development. Additionally, in 'Features of the reproduction of epiphyseal cartilage perivascular cells according to the results of an autoradiographic study', it mentions the formation of bone from cartilage (endochondral ossification) and the role of perivascular cells in this process. Based on these findings, we can conclude that certain bones develop through endochondral ossification.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: The ribs, sternum, clavicle and vertebrae\"\n}"]
