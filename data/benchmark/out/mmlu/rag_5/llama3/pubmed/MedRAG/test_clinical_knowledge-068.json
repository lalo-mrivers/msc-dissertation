["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the blood flow between contractions of the left ventricle. The key is to identify what keeps the blood flowing during this time. From the provided documents, it is clear that the endothelial cells lining the lumen of blood vessels play a crucial role in regulating cardiac contractility. Additionally, the right ventricle's physiology and hemodynamic functions are reviewed, highlighting its essential functions in the normal circulation. Given this information, we can focus on the right ventricle's relaxation phase during which it is not contracting. This allows the atria to continue contracting, maintaining blood flow through the vessels.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
