["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Malignant hyperthermia is a clinically heterogeneous pharmacogenetic disorder characterized by accelerated metabolism, hyperthermia, and frequently muscle rigidity. It can be triggered by succinylcholine and the volatile anesthetic agents in genetically predisposed individuals. Genetic studies have implicated an abnormality in the calcium release channel of the sarcoplasmic reticulum in skeletal muscle as the likely etiology. The results of linkage analyses exclude several loci on 19q13.1 as a site for the gene(s) that produces the MHS phenotype, suggesting genetic heterogeneity in this disorder.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
