["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The couple has a family history of Î±-thalassemia. The woman has a minimally decreased hemoglobin concentration and a single gene deletion. The man has microcytic anemia and a two-gene deletion. Since the deletions are in trans, one on the maternal gene and one on the paternal gene, we need to consider how this will affect the offspring's genotype.\n\nThe woman is homozygous for a single gene deletion (i.e., she has two copies of the same deleted allele), which means her offspring will inherit this deletion from her. The man is heterozygous for a two-gene deletion (i.e., he has one copy of each deleted allele). Since the deletions are in trans, his offspring will inherit either the maternal or paternal copy of the single gene deletion, but not both.\n\nSince the woman's offspring will always inherit the single gene deletion from her, we only need to consider how many of them will also inherit the paternal two-gene deletion. This is where the man's heterozygosity comes in. Half of his offspring will inherit the deleted allele and half will inherit the normal allele.\n\nTherefore, 25% of their offspring (half of whom will inherit both the single gene and the second gene deletion) will have a two-gene deletion.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
