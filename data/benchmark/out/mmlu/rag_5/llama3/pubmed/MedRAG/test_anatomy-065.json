["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the muscles derived from the first brachial arch. The relevant documents discuss the brachial plexus and its related nerves and muscles, but there is no direct information about the first brachial arch or the muscles derived from it. Therefore, we must rely on general knowledge of embryology to answer this question. In humans, the first brachial arch gives rise to the muscles of mastication (masseter, temporalis, and medial pterygoid) as well as the anterior belly of digastric muscle. This information is not provided in the given documents, but it can be used to answer the question.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
