["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about why net primary productivity tends to increase toward the tropics. From the given documents, we can see that the topic of resource partitioning is discussed, which relates to evolutionary change in species in response to selection pressures generated by interspecific competition. However, this does not directly relate to the increase in net primary productivity towards the tropics. The paper on Phosphorus and the eutrophication of lakes suggests that increased loadings on richer lakes make relatively less impact than does mild eutrophication of unproductive waters. This also is not a direct explanation for the increase in net primary productivity.\n\nThe document on Roles for secondary metabolites in plants discusses the role of secondary metabolites in plants, including their role in defense against predators and competitors, as well as protection against extrinsic abiotic factors. However, this does not directly relate to the question either.\n\nThe paper [The influence of the greenhouse effect on vegetation--results of studies in England] provides some information on the effects of increased concentration of carbon dioxide on terrestrial ecosystems, including plant growth in general and forests in particular. Deciduous trees and conifers react differently to increased atmospheric CO2. This document does not directly relate to the question either.\n\nConsidering the provided documents, we can see that none of them directly address the question. Therefore, we need to look for an explanation outside of these documents. Looking at the general principles of ecology, we know that net primary productivity is influenced by factors such as temperature, water availability, and photosynthesis. The tropics have higher temperatures and more available sunlight throughout the year, which would increase photosynthesis rates.\n\nTherefore, considering the general ecological principles and the information provided in the documents, the best explanation for why net primary productivity in terrestrial ecosystems tends to increase toward the tropics is that the availability of water and warm temperatures in the tropics fosters photosynthesis.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
