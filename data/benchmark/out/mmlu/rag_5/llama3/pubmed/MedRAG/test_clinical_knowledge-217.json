["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the adaptations of skeletal muscle to growth and exercise. Endurance training is mentioned as a type of exercise that can increase oxidative capacity so that a person can resist fatigue for increasing periods of time. Another document discusses the energy metabolism and fuel utilization during endurance activities, suggesting a greater role for lipids than previously thought. The key point here is that endurance training increases the muscle's capacity to burn fat and carbohydrate as energy sources. This is supported by another study that shows an increase in the storage capacity for intramuscular lipids and increased mitochondrial density among marathon runners.\", \"answer_choice\": C}"]
