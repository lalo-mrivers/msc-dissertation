["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the characteristics of r-selected species. The relevant document for this is 'Lineage selection and the capacity to evolve'. This passage discusses the evolution of genetic diversity, particularly in the context of frequency-dependent selection by predators, parasites, and competitors. From this, we can infer that r-selected species are likely to have high reproductive rates (rapidly producing offspring) and small body sizes, as these characteristics would allow them to adapt quickly to their environments. The other options do not seem to be directly related to the concept of r-selection, so it is unlikely that they would be typical characteristics of r-selected species. Therefore, we can conclude that high competitive ability is an exception to this rule.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
