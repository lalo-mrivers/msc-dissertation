["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The problem is about calculating the relative risk of death from a specific type of cancer in individuals who take Drug X compared to those who don't. To solve this, we need to calculate the risk ratio between the two groups. The number of deaths in both groups is the same (100 each), but the proportion of participants receiving the drug is different (200 out of 600 vs 0 out of 400). We can use the formula for relative risk: RR = (events per exposed / total events per exposed) / (events per unexposed / total events per unexposed). In this case, both events are 100. So, we just need to calculate the proportion of participants receiving Drug X and compare it to those who didn't receive it.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
