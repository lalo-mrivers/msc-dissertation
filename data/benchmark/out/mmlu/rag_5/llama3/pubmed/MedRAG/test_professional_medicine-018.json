["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 2-year-old boy with a 30-minute history of respiratory distress. He has inspiratory stridor, tachypnea, and labored breathing. His oxygen saturation is 89% on room air, which improves to 93% after treatment with 40% oxygen via venturi mask. Given his symptoms and physical examination findings, it's likely that he has a congenital or acquired abnormality of the large diameter airways, as described in the document 'Stridor in infants and children: ambulatory evaluation and operative diagnosis'.
