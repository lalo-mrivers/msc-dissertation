["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the given documents, we know that during prolonged exercise, ammonia production is greatest and is associated with glutamine and alanine metabolism. We also know that under these circumstances, it is proposed that ammonia is produced from slow twitch fibers by the deamination of branched chain amino acids. Therefore, we can conclude that when branched chain amino acids are deaminated in muscle, the ammonia produced is primarily used for energy production and NH3 production.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
