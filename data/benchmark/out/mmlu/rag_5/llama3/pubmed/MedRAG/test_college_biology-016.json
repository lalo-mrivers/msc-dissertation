["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The provided documents do not directly mention mycorrhizal fungi conferring benefits to plants. However, we can look at the characteristics of mycorrhizal associations mentioned in the first document, 'Emerging strategies for enhancing crop resistance to microbial pathogens'.

This implies that mycorrhizal fungi may not fix nitrogen.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
