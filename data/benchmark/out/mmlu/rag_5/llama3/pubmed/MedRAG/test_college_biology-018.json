["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Retrotransposons are retroelements that can move from one site to another without integrating into the host genome. They use an RNA intermediate to replicate themselves. The passage about L1 elements states that when transfected into baby hamster kidney cells, a consensus mouse L1 element underwent retrotransposition by way of an RNA intermediate. This suggests that retrotransposons replicate via an RNA intermediate.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
