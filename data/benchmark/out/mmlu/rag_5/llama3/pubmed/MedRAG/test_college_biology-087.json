["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents provide information on the evolution of canine dimorphism in anthropoid primates. One of the factors proposed as an influence is intrasexual competition. A study found that intermale competition explains a large proportion of the variation in canine dimorphism, and it is very strongly associated with canine dimorphism. Additionally, sexual selection has been questioned because mating system does not well predict variation in canine dimorphism. This suggests that intense competition between males may be driving the evolution of canine dimorphism.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
