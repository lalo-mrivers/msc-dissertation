["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has a low leukocyte count due to chemotherapy. The case report of desquamative interstitial pneumonia shows that during a relapse, the bronchoalveolar lavage revealed a remarkable increase in total cells and a low CD4+/CD8+ ratio in the lymphocyte subset. This suggests an increase in lymphocytes. Additionally, the study on the leukocyte count and risk of lung cancer shows a marked increase in risk with increasing leukocyte count. However, this does not apply to our patient who is undergoing chemotherapy for small cell carcinoma. The study on acute changes in haematological parameters on cessation of smoking shows that elevated haemoglobin concentration, packed cell volume, red cell count, white cell count, neutrophil count, lymphocyte count and platelet count return rapidly towards normal after withdrawal of cigarette smoking. This suggests that the patient's low leukocyte count is an acute effect of chemotherapy rather than a response to tissue damage. Therefore, the most appropriate pharmacotherapy to increase this patient's leukocyte count would be a granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) such as filgrastim.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
