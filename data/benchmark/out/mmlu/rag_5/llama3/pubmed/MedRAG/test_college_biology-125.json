["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about adaptations that would limit pollination by bees (mainly Africanized honey bees) and promote hummingbird pollination. From the provided documents, we can see that Africanized honey bees are described as more defensive, likely to defend their nest in large numbers, and therefore cause multiple stings. This suggests that these bees are attracted to nectar-rich flowers. On the other hand, hummingbirds are known to be attracted to pendant (hanging) red-colored flowers.\n\nConsidering this information, option C: Pendant (hanging) red-colored flowers is likely to promote hummingbird pollination and limit pollination by bees.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
