["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, we need to understand the concept of the speed of sound. The speed of sound is approximately 343 meters per second at room temperature. Since the distance between the camera and the car is 200 meters, we can calculate the time it takes for the gunshot sound to reach the camera using the formula: time = distance / speed. Plugging in the values, we get: time = 200 meters / (343 m/s). Next, we need to calculate the frequency of the gunshot as perceived by the camera. Since the camera is moving at a speed of 72 km/h and the sound is traveling through air, we can use the concept of relativity to adjust the frequency. According to the article 'The human visual system averages speed information', when the observer (camera) is moving with respect to the source (gunshot), the perceived frequency is affected by the relative motion. We need to calculate the Doppler shift using the formula: Δf = f0 \\* v / c, where f0 is the original frequency, v is the velocity of the camera, and c is the speed of sound. Plugging in the values, we get: Δf = 800 Hz \\* (72 km/h) / (343 m/s). Finally, we add the Doppler shift to the original frequency to get the perceived frequency.\", \"answer_choice\": B}"]
