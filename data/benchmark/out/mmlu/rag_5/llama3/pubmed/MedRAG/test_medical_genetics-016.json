["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks for the frequency of AABBCC individuals from a mating of two AaBbCc individuals. We know that alleles are completely recessive and that only the double recessive genotype aabb shows a deleterious effect with relative fitness 1-epsilon. The main aim is to investigate the situation where va = vb exactly. In this case, a neutral equilibrium is attained and either locus can drift to fixation for the mutant allele.\n\nWe see from the first document that if va greater than vb, mutant a becomes fixed in the population by mutation pressure and a mutation-selection balance is ultimately attained with respect to the B/b locus alone. However, since va = vb here, we don't have any bias towards one or the other, so both Aa and aabb are equally likely to be expressed.\n\nIn the second document, Acrocentric chromosome associations in man, we see that heterogeneity among chromosomes is found to be a highly significant source of variation for association proportions. However, this doesn't seem relevant to our current problem since we're dealing with genotypes rather than chromosomal associations.\n\nThe third document, Tests for association of gene frequencies at several loci in random mating diploid populations, provides methods for analyzing data on genotype frequencies at several codominant loci in random mating diploid populations. However, it doesn't seem directly applicable to our problem since we're not dealing with multiple loci here.\n\nThe fourth document, Increased HLA-B heterozygosity with age, seems unrelated to our current problem as well.\n\nFrom the above information, we can deduce that both Aa and aabb are equally likely to be expressed. Since AABBCC is a double recessive genotype, it's equivalent to having two Aa and two Bb, which in turn is equivalent to having two a and four b alleles. Therefore, the frequency of AABBCC individuals from a mating of two AaBbCc individuals is equivalent to the probability of obtaining two a and four b alleles.\n\nFrom Mendelian inheritance principles, the probability of this occurring is 1/4 (since there are 2 possible genotypes for each of the 5 loci) times 1/16 (since we need 4 b alleles), which gives us 1/64. So the answer should be A: 1.0/64.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
