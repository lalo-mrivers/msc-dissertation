["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the products of ADP degradation that increase in concentration in the blood during multiple sprint sports. The relevant information can be found in 'Abnormal high-energy phosphate metabolism in human muscle phosphofructokinase deficiency'. In this study, ammonia (NH3) was measured as an index of muscle [AMP]. During maximal forearm exercise, NH3 increased approximately twofold more in venous effluent in PFKD than in HS. This suggests that ammonia increases in concentration during high-intensity exercise. Urea and uric acid are also products of ADP degradation, but the study does not explicitly state whether they increase in concentration. However, since ammonia is mentioned as a product of AMP deamination, it is likely that urea and uric acid also increase in concentration.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B: Ammonia, urea and uric acid.\"}"]
