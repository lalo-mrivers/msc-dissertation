["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about what might be found in connective tissue. Based on the provided documents, we can see that connective tissue is affected by corticosteroids which lead to atrophy (influence of corticosteroids on connective tissue). Connective tissue also plays a crucial role in cardiovascular performance and is involved in various disease processes (cardiovascular manifestations of connective tissue disorders). Additionally, manual therapy affects the physical properties of connective tissue.
