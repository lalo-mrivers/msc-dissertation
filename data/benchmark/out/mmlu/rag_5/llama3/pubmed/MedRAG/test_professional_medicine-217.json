["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is hypertensive with a systolic blood pressure of 165 mmHg. The relevant documents suggest that patients with consistent mild elevations in diastolic blood pressure may require treatment. Since the patient's blood pressure is elevated, it is likely that he has essential hypertension, which is defined as systemic blood pressure equal to or exceeding 140/90 mm Hg. Given this information, it is reasonable to consider factors that could contribute to his high blood pressure. According to the guidelines for evaluating and treating hypertension, diuretics are the cornerstone of therapy. If blood pressure does not respond adequately to these agents, a step-care approach with more potent antihypertensives is indicated. Since the patient's systolic blood pressure is 165 mmHg, it is likely that his peripheral vascular resistance would increase further.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
