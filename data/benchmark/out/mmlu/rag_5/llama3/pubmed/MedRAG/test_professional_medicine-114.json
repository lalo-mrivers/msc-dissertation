["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Since the patient's father had classic hemophilia, it means she is an obligate carrier of hemophilia A. The karyotype obtained from the amniotic fluid sample shows that the fetus is XY. As hemophilia A is an X-linked hereditary bleeding disorder, a male offspring (XY) would not be affected by the condition. Therefore, we can rule out options D and B, as they suggest the infant might have hemophilia.
