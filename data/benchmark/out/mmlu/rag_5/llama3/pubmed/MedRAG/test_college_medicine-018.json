["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about a very weak base. Weak bases are defined as substances that have a pKb (base dissociation constant) value close to the pH of the solution. Since this is a very weak base, its pKb would be expected to be close to the pOH of the solution. The pOH is simply 14 - pH, so if the pKb were equal to the pOH, that would mean the pKb was also around 14 - pH.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
