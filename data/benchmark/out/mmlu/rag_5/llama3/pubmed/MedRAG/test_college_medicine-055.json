["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking which of the following promotes glucose and amino acid uptake by muscle. We can look at the provided documents to find the answer. The first document talks about blood flow and uptake of glucose and amino acids in ischemic muscle, but it doesn't mention any specific hormone that promotes glucose and amino acid uptake. The second document discusses the regulation of simple sugar transport in insulin-responsive cells, which suggests that insulin might be involved. The third document is a metabolic study on human skeletal muscle tissue, but it doesn't provide direct information about glucose and amino acid uptake. The fourth document investigates peripheral glucose uptake and skeletal muscle GLUT4 content in man, and it shows that insulin infusion increases glucose uptake.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
