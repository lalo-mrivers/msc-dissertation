["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to the provided documents, an increase in the inbreeding coefficient F is likely to cause a reduction in effective population size Ne because nonrandom mating whereby parents are related will increase genetic drift. This can be seen from the equation Ne = N/(1 + alpha) where Sk2 is the variance of family size and alpha is the departure from Hardy-Weinberg proportions, which increases with F. Additionally, the documents suggest that an increase in F will reduce the cumulative nonadditive variance until fixation or loss for dominant genes, and also reduce the average time until extinction of deleterious mutations. Therefore, it can be concluded that an increase in F is likely to result in a reduced likelihood of heterozygotes being present in a population.\", \"answer_choice\": A}"]
