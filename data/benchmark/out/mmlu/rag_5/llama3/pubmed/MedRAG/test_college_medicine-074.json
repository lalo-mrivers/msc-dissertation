["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about MERRF, a disorder caused by a mutation in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). The key point is that the disorder follows a maternal inheritance pattern, as mtDNA is inherited solely from one's mother. When an affected male and a normal female reproduce, the offspring will inherit either the mutated mtDNA from the father or the normal mtDNA from the mother. As the mutation impairs protein synthesis, oxygen consumption, and energy production, it is likely that the severity of the disorder depends on the proportion of mutated mtDNA in the cells.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
