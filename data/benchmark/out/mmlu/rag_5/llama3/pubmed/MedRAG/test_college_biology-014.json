["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The passage highlights the role of TATA-binding protein (TBP) in transcription by RNA polymerases I, II, and III. Eukarya utilize general transcription factors like TBP and TFIIB, whereas Bacteria do not. Archaea has a protein similar to TBP and another similar to TFIIB. This suggests that Archaea is more closely related to Eukarya than Bacteria. Since Archaea and Eukarya both use TBP and TFIIB in transcription, it's likely that they diverged before their common ancestor with Bacteria.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
