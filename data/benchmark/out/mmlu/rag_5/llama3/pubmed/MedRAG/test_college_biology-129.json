["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about cellular uptake of cholesterol. According to the provided documents, LDL binds to cell-surface receptors and is internalized through a saturable uptake mechanism. HDL binding to cells does not involve high-affinity binding or receptor-mediated endocytosis. The document 'Binding, internalization, and degradation of high density lipoprotein by cultured normal human fibroblasts' states that HDL binding to cells can be almost completely accounted for by the uptake of medium during pinocytosis and by invagination of surface membrane (bearing bound lipoprotein) during pinocytosis. Therefore, it is unlikely that HDL cholesterol complexes are internalized through receptor-mediated endocytosis. The other options do not relate to cellular uptake of cholesterol.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
