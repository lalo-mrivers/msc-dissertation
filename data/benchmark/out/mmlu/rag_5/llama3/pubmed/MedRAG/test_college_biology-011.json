["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about targeting of a newly synthesized protein to a specific destination. The documents discuss signal peptides and their role in targeting proteins to different locations. We can see that some signal peptides are recognized by binding species, while others are recognized by cellular proteins that bind these structures and mediate targeted transport. Mitochondrial protein uptake involves specific recognition, membrane translocation, proteolytic processing, and folding of nuclear-encoded precursor proteins. Therefore, we need to identify which destination requires two different signal peptides.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B\n}"]
