["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, we need to calculate the rate of dopamine infusion for a 65 kg person. Since the rate is given as micrograms per kilogram per minute (mcg/kg/min), we can multiply the weight in kilograms by the rate in mcg/kg/min to get the total amount infused per minute. In this case, that would be: 65 kg x 4 mcg/kg/min = 260 mcg/min. Since we want to know how many milligrams will be received in an hour, we need to convert the rate from minutes to hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so we can divide the rate by 60 to get: 260 mcg/min รท 60 = 4.33 mcg/hr. Since we want to know how many milligrams will be received in an hour, we need to convert this amount from micrograms to milligrams. There are 1000 micrograms in one milligram, so we can divide the amount by 1000 to get: 4.33 mcg รท 1000 = 0.00433 mg/hr.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
