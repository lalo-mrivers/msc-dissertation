["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the body's compensation mechanism for increased environmental temperature. From the provided documents, it can be seen that when the environment becomes hot, the body increases heat production by sweating (evaporation of sweat) and also increases thermal conductance through peripheral vasodilation. There is no mention of decreasing salt retention or increasing heart rate as a response to heat. The document on control of sweating rate while exercising in the heat does mention that the body must be able to effectively increase sweating rate in hot conditions, which suggests an increase in water lost through skin.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D\n}"]
