["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking which feature suggests that a pulsation in the neck is arterial. The relevant documents describe vascular lesions of the neck, carotid artery flow velocities, aneurysms of the extracranial carotid arteries, and pseudo velocity profiles in carotid artery through Doppler US signal processing. From these documents, we know that changes in internal carotid artery flow velocities can be detected by non-invasive Doppler-shift ultrasound. This suggests that pulsations in the neck can be evaluated using Doppler ultrasound. The other options do not directly relate to the question of whether a pulsation is arterial or not.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
