["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, we know that muscle fibres can be subdivided into type I (slow-twitch) and type II (fast-twitch). Type II fibres are recruited in addition to type I fibres at high forces during voluntary isometric contractions. We also know from document 2 that the relaxation rate of type II fibres was calculated to be twice as fast as that of type I fibres. This information suggests that type II fibres have a higher ATPase activity compared to type I fibres.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
