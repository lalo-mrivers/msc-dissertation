["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to the provided documents, particularly [Classes of antibiotics and their mechanisms of action], antibiotics that affect bacterial cells interfere with processes such as cell wall synthesis (inhibitors of the biosynthesis of the bacterial cell wall), protein synthesis (inhibitors of the bacterial protein synthesis), and nucleic acid metabolism (inhibitors of the nucleic acid metabolism). Reverse transcriptase is not a process affected by antibiotics, as it is an enzyme involved in RNA-dependent DNA synthesis, which is a process unique to retroviruses. Therefore, antibiotics that affect bacterial cells do not interfere with reverse transcriptase.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
