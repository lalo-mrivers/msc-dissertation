["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The provided documents describe lactate transport and utilization in skeletal muscle cells. From these documents, we can infer that lactate is produced by degradation of glucose-6-phosphate during glycolysis in the contracting muscles. During exercise, lactate release from the leg increases linearly with the muscle lactate concentration up to about 4-5 mmol/min, but then the relationship reveals a clear leveling off. This indicates a maximal level for lactate release from the exercising muscles. Additionally, it is mentioned that oxidation of L-lactate is quantitatively the most important means of disposing of lactate, whether in exercising or nonexercising muscle.\n\nConsidering these points, we can conclude that the main fate of lactate that leaves muscle and enters the circulation is likely to be its release into the bloodstream for transport to other tissues where it can be used as an energy source or converted back into glycogen.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
