["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents discuss the relationship between blood lactate concentrations and tissue oxygenation, as well as the effects of lactate infusion on glucose and FFA metabolism. The studies suggest that blood lactate concentration is influenced by factors such as muscle lactate production, removal, and efflux, rather than just anaerobic glycolysis or muscle glucose uptake. Therefore, it can be inferred that the rate of blood lactate accumulation is determined by the rate of muscle lactate production and the rate of muscle lactate efflux.\",\n\"answer_choice\": A\n}"]
