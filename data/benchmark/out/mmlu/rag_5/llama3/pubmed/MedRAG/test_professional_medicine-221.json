The symptoms began after returning from a camping trip in New Mexico. This suggests the possibility of an infection caused by a tick-borne illness such as Rocky Mountain spotted fever (RMSF). The patient's physical examination shows generalized scattered black maculae and an erythematous, solid, tender mass on the underside of his right upper extremity just above the elbow; the mass is draining blood and necrotic material. This supports the suspicion of RMSF, which is caused by Rickettsia rickettsii bacteria. The most effective antibiotic for this patient's disorder will be an antibiotic that targets these bacteria. Doxycycline is a commonly used antibiotic for treating RMSF and it interferes with protein synthesis by inhibiting translation.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C: Proteasomal degradation\""]
