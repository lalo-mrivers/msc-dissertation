["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the provided documents, I did not find any direct information about the risk of using water for bladder washout. However, I found that hydrostatic pressure treatment for bladder tumors can cause complications such as bladder perforations and electrolyte imbalance (see 'Hydrostatic bladder distention for bladder tumor' document). Additionally, occult neuropathic bladder is characterized by high intravesical pressure associated with urinary retention and functional outflow resistance (see 'Occult neuropathic bladder' document), which may be relevant to understanding the risk of using water for bladder washout. Considering these points, I think that C: Using water may cause electrolyte imbalance is a plausible answer.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
