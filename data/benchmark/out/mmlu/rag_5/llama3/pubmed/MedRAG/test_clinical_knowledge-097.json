["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about peripheral muscle fatigue during multiple sprint activities. The relevant documents describe the changes that occur in human muscle during isometric fatigue, rate of fatigue during repeated submaximal contractions, and fatigue of long duration in human skeletal muscle after exercise. According to these documents, the development of peripheral muscle fatigue is not directly related to ATP or glycogen depletion. Additionally, it is mentioned that lactate could be responsible for fatigue at intermediate tensions (30-50% MVC), but this possibility seems remote at higher and lower tensions. The documents also suggest that conduction or mechanical failure could contribute to muscle fatigue, possibly through defects in excitation contraction coupling processes such as intracellular acidosis, inadequate supply of energy for contraction, or disruption in Ca2+ homeostasis.\n\nConsidering these findings, the most likely explanation for peripheral muscle fatigue during multiple sprint activities is an accumulation of inorganic phosphate.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
