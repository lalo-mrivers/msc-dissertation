["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about what is more plausible in Finland than elsewhere. The key phrase here is 'Finland population studies'. It seems that the data used in these studies are from Finland. The data talks about sauna use and its benefits, which are a distinctive feature of Finnish culture. Therefore, it can be inferred that some of the options may be more plausible in Finland due to this cultural context. Options A, B, and D do not seem related to sauna use or Finnish culture, making them less likely. Option C is not entirely implausible as pet ownership might vary by country or region.
