["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about Immunoglobulins with epsilon heavy chains located on the plasma membranes of mast cells and basophilic leukocytes. In the given documents, IgE is described as being specific to human B cells and having a constant region (C epsilon 1, C epsilon 2, C epsilon 3-4) that can be recognized by monoclonal antibodies. The epitopes on membrane-bound but not secreted IgE are also discussed. Based on this information, it can be concluded that Immunoglobulins with epsilon heavy chains and located on the plasma membranes of mast cells and basophilic leukocytes belong to the class of antibodies called IgE.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
