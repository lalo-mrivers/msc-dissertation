["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about glucose transport into muscle cells. In the provided documents, it is mentioned that glucose transport occurs in peripheral tissues such as skeletal muscle via GLUT4 isoform expressed exclusively in insulin target tissues. Additionally, it is stated that glucose uptake in fat and muscle is likely rate-limiting for glucose metabolism and that pretranslational suppression of GLUT4 appears to be the key mechanism of insulin resistance in adipocytes.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
