["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the activity of an enzyme over a broad range of pH values. Since the activity is constant, it suggests that there are no ionizing groups on either the enzyme or substrate that participate in the reaction. This is because ionizing groups would typically show a change in reactivity with changing pH.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
