["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the provided documents, it is clear that adenoviruses have been used as vectors for gene expression. Adenovirus vectors are non-conditional and non-defective, which allows them to obtain high-level expression of foreign genes. Additionally, adenoviruses can infect a broad range of cells, including muscle cells in vivo. The advantages of using adenoviruses include their independence of host cell replication, broad host range, and potential capacity for large foreign DNA inserts.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
