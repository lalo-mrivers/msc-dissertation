["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The normal level of serum AFP in normal adults is 3.04 ng/ml +/- 1.9 SD (as stated in the document 'Alpha-fetoprotein levels in normal adults'). This suggests that average maternal serum level of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) is around 3.04 ng/ml. The question asks for a situation where maternal serum level of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) is lower than average. Since there are no other documents mentioning any specific conditions affecting AFP levels, we can infer that the situation would be one where AFP levels are generally low.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
