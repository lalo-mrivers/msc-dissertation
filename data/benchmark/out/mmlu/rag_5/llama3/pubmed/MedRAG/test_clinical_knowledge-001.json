["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The key to successful marathon running is endurance. Marathon runners must run consistently at about 80-90% of VO2max in order to achieve successful competitive performances (document 1). This high-intensity training requires a strong reliance on oxidation of fats, which is facilitated by the presence of Type I and IIA skeletal muscle fibers among marathon runners and their significantly improved storage capacity for intramuscular lipids and increased mitochondrial density (document 4). Additionally, the physiological demands of marathon running are extremely high, with total energy expenditure during marathon training and competition being among the highest reported for any endurance activity (document 1). Therefore, stamina is the key attribute in successful marathon running.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
