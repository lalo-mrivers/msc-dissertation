["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking how fatty acids are transported into the mitochondria. According to the first document 'Effect of long-chain fatty acids and acyl-CoA on mitochondrial permeability, transport, and energy-coupling processes.', fatty acids in the form of acyl-CoA are excellent respiratory substrates for mitochondria of most tissues. Their oxidation is coupled to the generation of high energy state of the mitochondrial membrane and, consequently, to ATP synthesis. This suggests that fatty acids are transported into the mitochondria bound to CoA.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B: coenzyme A (CoA)\""]
