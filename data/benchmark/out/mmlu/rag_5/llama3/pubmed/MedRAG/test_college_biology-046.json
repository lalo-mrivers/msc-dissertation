["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, we need to understand the effect of hyperventilation on blood pH. According to the document 'Ventilatory responsiveness to carbon dioxide below the normal control point in conscious normoxic humans', hyperventilation can lead to a decrease in partial pressure of CO2 and an increase in ventilation, which would result in a decrease in H+ ions (hydrogen ions). This is because increased CO2 removal from the blood leads to decreased acidity. Therefore, we can conclude that hyperventilation at rest would cause a decrease in partial pressure of carbon dioxide and a decrease in concentration of hydrogen ions.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
