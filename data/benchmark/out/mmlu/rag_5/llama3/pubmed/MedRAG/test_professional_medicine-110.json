["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with a swollen limb, fever for 8 days, anterior cervical lymphadenopathy, nonexudative conjunctivitis, strawberry tongue, an erythematous truncal rash, and edema of the hands and feet. The symptoms suggest a viral infection, specifically Hand, Foot and Mouth disease (HFMD) as described in the document 'Hand, foot and mouth disease--1973'. HFMD is a benign condition common in small children, with low infectivity. No bacterial or fungal infections are mentioned that would require intravenous antibiotics like penicillin.

Considering the patient's condition and symptoms, the most appropriate pharmacotherapy to prevent complications would be supportive care only, as there is no indication for immunoglobulin therapy or corticosteroids like prednisone.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A: None (Supportive care only)\"}"]
