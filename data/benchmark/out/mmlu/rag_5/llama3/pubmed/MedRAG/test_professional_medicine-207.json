["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"During the last minute of exercise, the pulse is 175/min. This indicates a high intensity exercise. As the duration increases, the body tries to conserve energy by reducing peripheral resistance and increasing blood flow to the muscles. This would lead to a decrease in total peripheral resistance (D). Stroke volume (B) might not be directly affected as it is influenced by multiple factors like heart rate, cardiac output, and venous return. Pulse pressure (A) is related to stroke volume and systolic blood pressure (C), so any changes would be indirect and not solely due to exercise duration.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
