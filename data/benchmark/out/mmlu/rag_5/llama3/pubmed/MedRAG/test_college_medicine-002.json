["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking which statement identifies a chemically based sensory system. The options are Gustatory (I), Auditory (II), Olfactory (III). The relevant documents discuss the mechanisms of sensitivity and specificity in olfaction, signaling pathways in odorant detection, coacervate-like membrane structures and olfactory transduction, and contributions to odor coding in the vertebrate olfactory pathway. This suggests that the correct answer is related to the sense of smell.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C: III only\"}"]
