["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the development of the primary palate, which involves the fusion of facial processes. The Autoradiographic study of macromolecular synthesis in the fusion epithelium of the developing rat primary palate in vitro mentions that changes in the synthesis of macromolecules occur during the fusion of the facial processes, including cessation of DNA synthesis in cells in a restricted zone of the epithelium. This suggests that the palatine processes begin to fuse around 8-10 weeks post-fertilization, which is consistent with other embryological studies.\", \"answer_choice\": B}"]
