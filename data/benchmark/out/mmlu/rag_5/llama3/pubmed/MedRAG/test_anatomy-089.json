["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, I will analyze each option to determine which one is a structural, fibrous protein found in the dermis. Option A, Collagen, is mentioned as forming poorly structured fibers loosely packed in sheets and dispersed within an excess of glycosaminoglycans in dermatosparaxis.
