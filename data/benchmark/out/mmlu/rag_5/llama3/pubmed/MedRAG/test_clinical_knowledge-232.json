["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the main fate of lactate that leaves muscle and enters the circulation. From the provided documents, it can be seen that lactate is continuously produced by skeletal muscle at rest and at all levels of exercise (Glyconeogenic and oxidative lactate utilization in skeletal muscle). The two primary fates of lactate in skeletal muscle are oxidation and glycogen synthesis (glyconeogenesis) (Glyconeogenic and oxidative lactate utilization in skeletal muscle). Oxidation of lactate is quantitatively the most important means of disposing of lactate, whether in exercising or nonexercising muscle (Glyconeogenic and oxidative lactate utilization in skeletal muscle).\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
