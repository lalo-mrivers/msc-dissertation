["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The provided documents describe the RecA protein's ability to promote rapid RNA-DNA hybridization, as well as studies on oligonucleotide-primed RNA synthesis. The stability and properties of double and triple helices are also discussed. None of these findings suggest a requirement for RNase or reverse transcriptase. DNA polymerase is not mentioned either. Therefore, the only remaining option that involves primers is B: a DNA or RNA primer and DNA polymerase.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
