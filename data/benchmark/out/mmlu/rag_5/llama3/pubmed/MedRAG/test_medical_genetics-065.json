["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the usefulness of simple tandem repeat polymorphisms in humans. The provided documents discuss microsatellites, restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP), and short tandem repeats (STRs) as markers for genetic linkage mapping and personal identification. Microsatellites are used to construct high-resolution genetic maps, while RFLPs can be used as genetic disease markers. STRs are highly polymorphic and inherited stably, making them useful for DNA typing and genetic mapping. Since the documents highlight the usefulness of these markers in solving paternity cases and personal identification, it is likely that simple tandem repeat polymorphisms in humans are most useful for...\",\n\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
