["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the infraorbital nerve. We need to find information related to this nerve from the provided documents. The first document discusses management of trauma to the facial nerve and does not provide relevant information. The second document is about the source of sensory fibres of the inferior conjunctiva, which is not directly related to the infraorbital nerve. The third document talks about microsurgical approaches to orbital tumors and does not mention the infraorbital nerve either. The fourth document discusses the extrinsic nerve supply of the naked rhinarium in tree shrews. It states that the skin in this region is supplied by the infraorbital nerves, which are branches of the maxillary division of the fifth cranial nerve. Therefore, we can conclude that the infraorbital nerve is a terminal branch of the maxillary division of the trigeminal nerve.\",\n\"answer_choice\": A"]
