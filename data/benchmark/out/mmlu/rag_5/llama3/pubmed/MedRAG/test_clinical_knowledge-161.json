["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The original document discusses the origin of acidosis in hyperlactataemia, energy metabolism in ischemic hearts, relationships among purine nucleoside metabolism, adenosine triphosphate catabolism, and glycolysis in human erythrocytes, energy utilization for control, and the effect of NAD recirculation on ATP stabilization. The question is about the net production of ATP via substrate-level phosphorylation in glycolysis. Substrate-level phosphorylation occurs through anaerobic glycolysis, which produces 2 molecules of ATP from one glucose molecule. Glycogen is not directly involved in this process.\", \"answer_choice\": B}"]
