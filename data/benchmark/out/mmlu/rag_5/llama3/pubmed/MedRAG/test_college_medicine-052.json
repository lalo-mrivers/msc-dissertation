["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, we need to convert the athlete's steady-rate oxygen uptake from liters per minute (L/min) to milliliters per second (mL/s). There are 1000 mL in one liter, so 3.0 L/min is equivalent to 3000 mL/min or 50 mL/s. The volume of oxygen consumed can be calculated using the formula VO2 = K \\* VCO2, where K is a conversion factor and VCO2 is the volume of CO2 produced. A commonly used value for K is 1/20 (since 1 mL of CO2 is produced per 20 mL of O2). Therefore, the energy expenditure can be calculated using the formula E = VO2 \\* ΔH, where ΔH is the heat of combustion for oxygen (approximately 19.8 kJ/L). We know that the athlete's steady-rate oxygen uptake averages 3.0 L/min for 5 minutes of exercise, so we need to calculate the total energy expenditure over this period.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the time from minutes to seconds: 5 minutes \\* 60 seconds/minute = 300 seconds. Then, we can calculate the total volume of oxygen consumed during exercise:\n\nVO2 = 3.0 L/min \\* (50 mL/s) / (1000 mL/L) = 1.5 mL/s\n\nFinally, we can calculate the total energy expenditure over this period using the formula E = VO2 \\* ΔH:\n\nE = 1.5 mL/s \\* 19.8 kJ/L = 30 kJ/min\n\nSince exercise lasts for 5 minutes, the total energy expenditure is:\n\nE = 30 kJ/min \\* 5 min = 150 kJ\",\n\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
