["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The passage does not provide direct information about the development of specific structures. However, we can infer that embryonic myocardioblasts are mentioned as a topic of study. Myocardioblasts are cells that eventually give rise to cardiac muscle tissue. Since ectomesenchyme is not explicitly linked to the development of these cells, we cannot conclude that skeletal muscles (option B) or motor neurons (option A) derive from ectomesenchyme. Melanocytes and sweat glands are not related to the embryonic development discussed in this passage, so options C and D can be eliminated.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"None of the above\"\n}"]
