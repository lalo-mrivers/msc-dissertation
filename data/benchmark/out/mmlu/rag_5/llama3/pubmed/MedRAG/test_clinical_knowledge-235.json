["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, there is no specific information about blood glucose concentration during 80-90 minutes of intermittent high intensity exercise. However, we can look at some relevant studies. In 'Serum insulin and glucose response to graded exercise in adults. Part I: the influence of fitness status', it was observed that significant increases in serum GC were seen during exercise in the active group, whereas little or no change was observed in the sedentary group. This suggests that blood glucose concentration may rise during exercise.\n\nIn 'Carbohydrate feeding during exercise', it is mentioned that during strenuous exercise (i.e., 70% maximal O2 consumption), there is a progressive shift from muscle glycogen to blood glucose oxidation with increasing duration of exercise. This implies that blood glucose concentration may increase as the exercise continues.\n\nFinally, in 'Increased insulin-stimulated glucose uptake by exercised human muscles one day after prolonged physical exercise', it was found that during a hyperinsulinaemic euglycaemic clamp (2 mU insulin kg-1 BW min-1) in nine healthy men before and 1 day after 3-h exercise (50% VO2max), basal glucose uptake was unchanged in the leg, while it was decreased in the forearm (-61%, P less than 0.01). This suggests that blood glucose concentration may remain relatively unchanged.\n\nGiven these findings, we can infer that the blood glucose concentration during 80-90 minutes of intermittent high intensity exercise: A: frequently rises by 1 - 3 mM.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
