["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the provided documents, we know that during exercise, glycogen breakdown occurs. In 'Some features of glycogen metabolism in human skeletal muscle', it is mentioned that at the same relative energy output, a muscle rich in type II fibers obtains a relatively larger energy contribution from carbohydrates than one rich in type I fibers. This suggests that glycogen breakdown is activated during exercise to provide energy. Additionally, 'Muscle glycogen and glucose uptake during exercise in humans' states that leg glucose uptake increases significantly during exercise, which also implies glycogen breakdown. Therefore, it can be inferred that glycogen breakdown in exercising muscle is not solely dependent on insulin or any other single factor.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D: none of the above.\"}"]
