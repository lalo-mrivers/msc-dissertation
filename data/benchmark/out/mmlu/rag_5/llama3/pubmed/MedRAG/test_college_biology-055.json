["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The gray crescent is a characteristic of the ventral blastomere. It contains the yolk nuclei and plays a crucial role in the development of the endoderm. In the experiment, one blastomere receives the gray crescent, while the other does not. Considering that the gray crescent is necessary for normal morphogenetic function of anuran endoderm (A factor necessary for normal morphogenetic function of anuran endoderm), it can be inferred that the blastomere with the gray crescent will have a developmental advantage over the one without it.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
