["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the oxidation of L-lactate, its relation to lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity, and the distribution of LDH isozymes in human skeletal muscle. The comparison of efflux rates shows that the rate of efflux of hydrogen ions exceeded that of lactate ions by factors of about 14 and 50 in rat diaphragm and frog sartorius muscles respectively. This suggests that lactate content does not represent absolute hydrogen ion load, particularly during early phase of efflux process. Therefore, L-lactate and hydrogen ions leave the muscle via a mechanism different from simple diffusion.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
