["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with difficulty focusing on tasks at work and home, increased energy, and a history of substance abuse. The patient's mood is described as 'good' with a labile affect. His speech is rapid in rate but normal in rhythm, and his thought process is organized. Short- and long-term memory are intact. Attention and concentration are fair. Based on these symptoms, I am considering possible psychiatric diagnoses that could be related to the patient's history of substance abuse. The patient's symptoms do not suggest a severe depression or anxiety disorder. His mood is described as 'good' which suggests that he may not be suffering from major depressive disorder. Therefore, I think it is more likely that his symptoms are related to a personality disorder rather than an organic condition like attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
