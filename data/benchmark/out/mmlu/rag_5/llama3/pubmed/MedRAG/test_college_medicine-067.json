["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about strategies to raise Karen's sense of self-efficacy. The relevant documents discuss the effects of success experiences on self-perceptions, self-esteem, and self-concept. Short-term counseling can improve self-esteem ratings by focusing on valued competencies. Individualized, success-oriented instructions in achievement settings can enhance self-concept. The study on patients' expectations of therapeutic improvement finds a positive relationship between expectations and outcomes when assessments are derived from patients.\n\nIn the context of Karen's therapy, seeking positive feedback from friends (A) could be a strategy to raise her sense of self-efficacy by gaining social acceptance and validation. Practicing daily on tasks she wishes to improve on (B) is also a relevant strategy as it can help build confidence and competence. Finding others her age and ability who excel at tasks she is interested in (C) could provide inspiration and motivation for Karen to improve her skills.\n\nHowever, the document does not explicitly suggest avoiding potential pitfalls by withholding from tasks she is not proficient in (D). Instead, it focuses on enhancing self-concept through success experiences. Therefore, this option would NOT be a strategy that her therapist would ask her to employ to raise her sense of self-efficacy.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
