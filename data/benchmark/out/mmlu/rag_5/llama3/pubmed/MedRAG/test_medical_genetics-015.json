["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents suggest that QTL analysis is used to identify chromosome regions associated with a complex trait. The first document talks about the effects of selection on linkage analysis for quantitative traits and how it can affect the power to detect linked QTL. The second document discusses recent developments in gene mapping, including advances in computational efficiency and methods for mapping genes for non-mendelian traits. The third document presents a maximum likelihood method for detecting QTL using full-sib families. All of these documents are related to QTL analysis and identifying chromosome regions associated with complex traits.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
