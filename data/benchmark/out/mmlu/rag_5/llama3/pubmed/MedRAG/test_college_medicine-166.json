["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the duration of exercise that can be sustained by the energy released from the breakdown of ATP and phosphocreatine. This information can be found in the document 'Resynthesis of creatine phosphate in human muscle after exercise in relation to intramuscular pH and availability of oxygen'. According to this study, the muscular store of creatine phosphate (CP) is almost completely depleted after exhaustive exercise. The resynthesis of CP during recovery normally occurs rapidly, but is totally inhibited if the local circulation to the muscle is occluded. This suggests that the energy released from the breakdown of ATP and phosphocreatine can sustain maximal exertion exercise for a certain duration.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
