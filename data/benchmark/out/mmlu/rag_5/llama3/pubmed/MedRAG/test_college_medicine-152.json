["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents discuss the energy conversion process in muscle contraction. ATP is mentioned as a crucial molecule that stores energy which can be transferred by resonant transitions in the ground state. The concept of chemimechanic equilibrium is also introduced, suggesting an approximate balance between chemical and mechanical forces throughout the transfer of free energy. Calcium is highlighted as a key player in controlling cellular energetics. Considering these points, it becomes clear that ATP is the primary source of energy for muscle contraction.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
