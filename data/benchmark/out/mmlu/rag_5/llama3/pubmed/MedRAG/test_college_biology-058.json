["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the first groups of animals to develop lung tissue adequate to support their respiratory requirements without the use of supplementary gas exchange organs. The relevant documents mention that the design features of the gas exchange region in the lung are optimal for gaseous diffusion, and that the extent of the gas exchange surface in adult lungs is determined by general maturation which is influenced by metabolic requirements of the organism. This suggests that the development of lung tissue was likely driven by the need to support increasing energy demands as animals evolved and grew in size. The morphometric estimation of pulmonary diffusion capacity in guinea pigs shows a linear relationship between body weight and lung volume, alveolar surface, capillary volume, and diffusion capacities. This implies that the development of lung tissue is closely tied to the metabolic requirements of the organism. Therefore, it can be inferred that mammals were likely among the first groups of animals to develop lung tissue adequate to support their respiratory requirements.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
