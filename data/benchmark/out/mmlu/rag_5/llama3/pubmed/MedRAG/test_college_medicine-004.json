["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The problem requires us to find the acceleration rate at which the car must accelerate to reach a velocity of 130 km/h. Since the distance is 50m, we can use kinematics equations to solve this problem. First, let's convert the velocity from km/h to m/s: 130 km/h = 36.6 m/s (using the conversion factor 1 km/h = 0.277777 m/s). Now, we can use the equation s = v0t + 0.5at^2 to find the acceleration rate a. We know that the initial velocity v0 is zero, since the car starts from rest. We also know the final velocity v (36.6 m/s) and the distance s (50m). Rearranging the equation to solve for a, we get: 50 = 0 + 0.5 * a * (50^2 / 36.6^2), which simplifies to a = approximately 13 m/s^2.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
