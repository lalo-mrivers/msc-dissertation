["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the effect of alpha (0.01) on the study's outcome, we need to understand how it affects type I error rate and power. A lower alpha means a more stringent test, which reduces the chance of Type I error (false positive). On the other hand, the increased stringency also decreases the study's power. In this case, since we're comparing two groups with 2500 patients each, the study already has some power. The reduction in power due to the lower alpha would be less noticeable. Therefore, the most likely result is that there will be a decreased likelihood of Type II error (false negative) and no significant change in the study's power.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
