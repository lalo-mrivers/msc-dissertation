["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the human body's defense mechanism against environmental bacteria. The relevant documents mention various mechanisms to deal with bacteria and their products, such as humoral and cellular immune responses, complement evasion strategies of microorganisms, and normal host defenses in the lung. These mechanisms suggest that mucous membranes and other physical barriers may play a role in preventing infection. The metabolic response to infection also suggests that certain hormones-like endogenous mediators contribute to the maintenance of body homeostasis and synthesis of acute phase reactant serum proteins. Therefore, it is likely that mucous membranes are involved in defense against environmental bacteria.\", \"answer_choice\": B}"]
