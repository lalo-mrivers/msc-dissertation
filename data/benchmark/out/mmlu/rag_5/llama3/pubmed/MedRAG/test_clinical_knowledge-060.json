["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about a fundamental cause of fatigue in high intensity exercise. We can start by looking at the documents provided. The first document talks about metabolic factors in fatigue and mentions that energetic deficiency plays a major role in muscle fatigue. It also discusses the depletion of phosphocreatine, glycogen, and ATP during exercise, which suggests that the ATP supply may not be meeting the demand.\n\nThe second document talks about fatigue after exercise and mentions that the long-lasting element of fatigue is probably due to an impairment of the process of excitation-contraction coupling. This suggests that there may be a problem with the energy supply rather than a problem with the cell concentration of ADP.\n\nThe third and fourth documents discuss chronic fatigue syndrome, which has some similar characteristics to high intensity exercise-induced fatigue. They mention that the fatigue can be disabling and is often made worse by physical activity, suggesting that the ATP demand may be exceeding the ATP supply.\n\nOverall, it seems likely that the fundamental cause of fatigue in high intensity exercise is a failure of the ATP supply to match the demand.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
