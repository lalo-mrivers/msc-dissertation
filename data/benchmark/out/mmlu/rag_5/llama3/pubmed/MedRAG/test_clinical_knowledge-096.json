["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking how many micrograms are in each dose of Ropinirole. The total dose is 1.5 mg. Since the dose is divided into three parts, we can calculate each dose by dividing the total dose by 3. 1.5 mg / 3 = 0.5 mg per dose. To convert this to micrograms, we multiply by 1000000 (since 1 mg = 1000000 mcg). 0.5 mg * 1000000 mcg/mg = 500000 mcg. Therefore, each dose is 500000 mcg.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
