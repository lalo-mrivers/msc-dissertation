["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant document mentioning the red fox is 'Terrestrial vertebrates of the New Hebrides: origin and distribution'. This document does not provide information about the relationship between red foxes and hares. However, we can use our general knowledge that when a predator's population is affected by a parasite, its prey's population may increase. In this case, since the mange mite is fatal to red foxes, as the mite population increases, red fox populations are likely to decrease. Since hares have no major predators at this site other than foxes, an increase in hare population is possible.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C: Fox populations will decrease and hare populations will increase.\""]
