["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about peripheral muscle fatigue during multiple sprint activities. We need to find the relevant information from the provided documents that explains the development of fatigue. The relevant document is 'Rate of fatigue during repeated submaximal contractions of human quadriceps muscle.' It states that at tensions of 30-50% MVC, the increase in lactate could be responsible for fatigue either directly or by indirect changes in pH; at higher and lower tensions the possibility that lactate is directly implicated in the development of fatigue seems remote. This suggests that an accumulation of lactate, which is a form of inorganic phosphate, could contribute to peripheral muscle fatigue during multiple sprint activities.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
