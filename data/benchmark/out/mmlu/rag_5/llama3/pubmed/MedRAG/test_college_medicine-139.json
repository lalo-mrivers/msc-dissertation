["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the rate of efflux of hydrogen and lactate ions from skeletal muscle in vitro. The study found that the rate of efflux of hydrogen ions exceeded that of lactate ions by factors of about 14 and 50 in the case of diaphragm and sartorius muscles respectively. This suggests that lactate is not leaving the muscle via a mechanism that directly regulates its exit, as the rate of efflux is not coupled to the concentration of lactate.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
