["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The provided documents describe the development of the limb of the embryonic chick, the binding characteristics of epidermal growth factor receptors on embryonal carcinoma cells, primary neural induction, and ectopic induction of dorsal mesoderm by overexpression of Xwnt-8 in Xenopus gastrula. None of these documents directly address the origin of ectoderm. However, it is well established that ectoderm gives rise to the outer layer of the embryo, which includes skin, hair, nails, and other tissues. In the context of the provided documents, the most relevant information is found in 'Effect of dorsal and ventral limb ectoderm on the development of the limb of the embryonic chick', where grafting of limb ectoderm to the dorsal surface of a host wing resulted in abnormal humerus in all cases except when the graft was obtained from the dorsal surface of the right wing and was in normal orientation. This suggests that ectoderm can give rise to different structures depending on its source and orientation.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
