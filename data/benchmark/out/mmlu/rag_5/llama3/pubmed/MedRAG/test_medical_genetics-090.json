["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the pattern of inheritance for disorders mapped using autozygosity mapping. Autozygosity mapping is a technique used to map recessive traits, which are typically inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. The relevant document mentioning autozygosity mapping is not present, but we can infer that it's related to chromosome 3 based on the question. Since the question mentions X-linked inheritance options, we can rule out A and B. Option D (X-linked recessive) is not directly related to the concept of autozygosity mapping, which deals with autosomal traits.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
