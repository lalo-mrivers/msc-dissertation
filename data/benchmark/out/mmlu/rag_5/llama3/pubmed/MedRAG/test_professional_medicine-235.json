["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has a history of self-mutilation and intentionally burned his right thigh several times with a cigarette lighter. He has developed shaking chills and pain in the same area, which is concerning for infection. The physical examination shows erythema, red streaks, and fluctuance around the burn sites, suggesting celluitis or abscesses. Laboratory studies show leukocytosis and hemoglobinemia, which supports the diagnosis of an infected wound. Given the severity of the infection and the patient's history of self-mutilation, psychiatric consultation is not enough. Incision and drainage may be necessary to drain the abscesses and promote healing. Topical silver sulfadiazine may not be effective in treating a deep tissue infection like this. Transferring the patient to a burn center may not be necessary unless there are additional complications or concerns that require specialized care.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
