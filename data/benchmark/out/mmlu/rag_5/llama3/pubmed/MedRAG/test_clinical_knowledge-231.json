["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the first fibre types to fatigue during all-out exercise such as sprinting. Based on the provided documents, we can see that type I fibres have a lower glycolytic capacity compared to type II fibres (Ess√©n et al., 1975; Harris et al., 1976). This suggests that type II fibres are more likely to fatigue first during high-intensity exercise.\n\nAdditionally, we can see from the document 'Energy metabolism in human slow and fast twitch fibres during prolonged cycle exercise' that glycogen degradation is most pronounced in type I fibres. This also supports the idea that type I fibres are less capable of sustaining high-intensity exercise and may fatigue earlier.\n\nFinally, from the document 'Glycogen breakdown in different human muscle fibre types during exhaustive exercise of short duration', we can see that the rates of glycogen breakdown were 32% lower in type I fibres compared to type II fibres during intense exercise. This again suggests that type II fibres are more resistant to fatigue and may be the first to fatigue.\n\nTherefore, based on these findings, it is likely that the first fibre types to fatigue during all-out exercise such as sprinting are Type II fibres.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: Type IIX fibres.\""]
