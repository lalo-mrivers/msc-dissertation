["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks what happens if there's a mutation in the repressor that prevents binding to lactose. Since glucose levels are low, this means we're considering catabolite repression. In the absence of glucose, the lac operon genes are induced. If the repressor can't bind to lactose, then it won't be able to prevent induction. Therefore, we expect constitutive expression of the lac operon genes.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
