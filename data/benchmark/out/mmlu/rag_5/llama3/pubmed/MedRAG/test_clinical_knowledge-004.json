["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about when closed pouches are applied. We need to find the answer among the provided documents. From the 'Pouch dynamics--a simple test of ileo-anal pouch evacuation' document, we see that a case of blind pouch formation is reported, which presents as gastrointestinal bleeding 23 years following side-to-side small bowel anastomosis. This suggests that closed pouches are applied in situations where there is a failure or abnormality in the functioning of the pouch. From the 'Functional disorders after deep rectum resection: is pouch formation recommended?' document, we see that some patients report pouch evacuation problems, using enemas or suppositories to empty their reservoirs. This further supports the idea that closed pouches are applied when there is an abnormality in the functioning of the pouch. Therefore, it seems that option C: In the immediate post-operative period does not accurately capture the situation where closed pouches are applied. Option A: The patient has a semi-formed or liquid output could be related to pouch dysfunction, but it is not directly mentioned in the provided documents. Options B and D refer to types of stomies, which are not relevant to the concept of closed pouches.\", \"answer_choice\": C}"]
