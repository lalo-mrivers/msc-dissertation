["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the polytene chromosomes seen in Drosophila salivary glands with the aid of a light microscope. From the provided documents, we can infer that polytene chromosomes are produced by repeated rounds of DNA replication followed by nuclear division (see 'A method for determination of the in situ distribution of chromosomal proteins' and 'The morphology of normal and denatured polytene chromosomes from Drosophila melanogaster'). Therefore, option C is the correct answer.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
