["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about a species of small rodent that has a unique characteristic - having a litter size of 2 or 3. This is unusual for small rodents. The key to solving this problem lies in understanding the characteristics that are associated with such litter sizes. One possible characteristic is moderate sexual size dimorphism, as mentioned in the document 'Mammals in which females are larger than males.' According to this document, when females are larger than males, it may be due to the fact that a big mother is often a better mother, and there is more competition among females for some resource. This could lead to smaller litter sizes, as females invest more energy in their young. Therefore, it is likely that these rodents exhibit moderate sexual size dimorphism.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
