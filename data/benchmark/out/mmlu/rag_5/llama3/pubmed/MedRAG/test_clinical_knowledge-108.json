["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the provided documents, we can see that glucose production was studied in isolated hepatocytes using various substrates. The study showed that fructose was the best gluconeogenic substrate, followed by lactate, pyruvate, glycerol, galactose, alanine, and succinate. This suggests that the synthesis of glucose from these substrates is a process called gluconeogenesis.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
