["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the rate of leaching and cycling of nutrients in different biomes. The relevant documents do not directly answer this question. However, they provide information about trace elements and their mobilization in soils. This suggests that the availability of phosphorus might be critical for mankind, as mentioned in one of the documents. The document 'Soil and plant factors influencing the accumulation of heavy metals by plants' mentions that the rate of release and form of soluble species will have a strong influence on the rate and extent of uptake and perhaps mobility and toxicity in the plant. This implies that the leaching and cycling of nutrients could be influenced by factors such as soil properties, mineralogy, particle size distribution, and microbial activity. Based on this information, it is possible to infer that tropical rainforests, which are known for their high levels of biological activity and nutrient cycling, might have a higher rate of leaching and cycling of nutrients.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
