["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about rheumatoid arthritis. I should look for relevant information from the provided documents. According to 'Current management of rheumatoid arthritis', rheumatoid arthritis is usually a relentlessly progressive disease leading to joint damage and disability. This suggests that it is not an oligoarthropathy (option B). The document does not mention the prevalence of rheumatoid factor, so option A cannot be determined from this information. 'Long-term outcome of rheumatoid arthritis' mentions that anaemia is not a common finding in patients with seropositive RA. Therefore, option C is incorrect. 'Presentation of rheumatoid arthritis and its relation to prognosis' does not mention Heberden's nodes as a feature of rheumatoid arthritis. Hence, option D is also incorrect.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
