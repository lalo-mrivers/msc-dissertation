["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about an early-successional plant community. We need to find the characteristic that is predicted for such a community. From the provided documents, we can see that there are no direct mentions of early-successional plant communities. However, we can analyze the information available. For example, in the 'Properties of some density-dependent integrodifference equation population models' document, it is mentioned that the models predict stable, cyclical, and chaotic asymptotic behavior. This suggests a dynamic environment. In the 'Evolution of ecological differences in the Old World leaf warblers' document, we can see that closely related species tend to differ along only one niche axis, habitat choice. This implies that there may be some environmental factors driving adaptation.\n\nFrom this analysis, we can conclude that an early-successional plant community is likely to have a high frequency of r-selected species, which are adapted to rapidly colonize and grow in disturbed or changing environments.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"]
