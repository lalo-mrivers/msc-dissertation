["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the development of the viscerocranium bones. The relevant information comes from 'Developmental defects in the cranial vault' which states that the parietal bone is one of the targets for developmental conditions, but it does not provide specific information on the development of the viscerocranium. However, we can look at 'Bone physiology' which mentions endochondral ossification and intramembranous ossification as two types of bone formation. Since the viscerocranium bones are part of the cranial vault, they might develop through intramembranous ossification. Additionally, there is no mention of neural growth pattern in the provided documents, making option B irrelevant.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C: intramembranous ossification and follow the somatic growth pattern.\""]
