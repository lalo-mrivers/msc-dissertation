["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question states that an individual is born with a mutation causing her to partially retain a form of fetal hemoglobin into adulthood. This suggests that the person has a condition where she produces more fetal hemoglobin than normal adults. Fetal hemoglobin has a higher affinity for oxygen than adult hemoglobin, so it would bind to oxygen more efficiently.\n\nThe options suggest that the person may have either no difference from a normal adult, reduced oxygen binding in the lungs, or increased oxygen binding in the tissues.\n\nFrom this information, we can conclude that the correct answer is D: increased oxygen binding to hemoglobin in the tissues.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
