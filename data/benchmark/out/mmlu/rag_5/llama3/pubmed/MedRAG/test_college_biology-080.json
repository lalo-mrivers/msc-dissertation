["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about similarities between cancer cells grown in culture and normal cells grown in culture. We can analyze the provided documents to find statements that describe the growth behavior of both normal and abnormal human mammary epithelia. Document 1 states that malignant cells divided at a slower mean rate than normal cells, whereas document 2 mentions that some categories of tumour grew more readily than others under certain conditions. Document 4 also discusses the growth control of heterologous tissue culture cells in nude mice. Based on these findings, we can conclude that cancer cells grown in culture may not necessarily proliferate to the same cell density as normal cells.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
