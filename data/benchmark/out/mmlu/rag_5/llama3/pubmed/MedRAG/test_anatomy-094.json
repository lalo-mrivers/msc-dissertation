["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents suggest that the temporomandibular joint is influenced by proprioceptive mechanisms, which suggests that there is a relationship between the muscles involved in jaw movement and the movement of the mandible. The study on muscle spindle supply to the human jaw muscle reveals that the temporal muscle has the most extensive mobility, which is likely influenced by proprioception. The study on the relationship between lateral border movements of the mandible and the determinants of occlusion suggests that aberrant external pterygoid muscle activity can restrict contralateral jaw border movements. This information, along with the fact that there are no specific details about right or left lateral excursion, leads me to conclude that both lateral pterygoid muscles could be involved in a right lateral excursion of the mandible.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B: Right lateral pterygoid muscle\""]
