["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, we can see that hypertonic solutions are mentioned multiple times. In the first document, it is stated that a predominantly hypernatremic hyperosmolarity (5.9% of cases) requires weak alkaline hypotonic electrolytic solutions (222 mOsm/l). This suggests that these solutions have a lower concentration of solutes than the normal human cell. Similarly, in the second document, hypertonic saline is mentioned as a solution used to treat intracranial hypertension. This implies that it has a higher concentration of solutes than the normal human cell. The third and fourth documents provide more information about the use of hypertonic solutions in various clinical scenarios, but do not contradict the previous findings.\",\n\"answer_choice\": A"]
