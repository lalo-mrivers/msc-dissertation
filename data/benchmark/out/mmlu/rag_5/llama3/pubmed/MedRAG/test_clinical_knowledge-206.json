["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about recognized causes of chronic cough. From the provided documents, we can see that a comprehensive discussion on the management approach to chronic persistent cough is presented. In 'Cough' and 'Cough Variant Asthma', it is mentioned that chronic cough is usually due to chronic bronchitis or postnasal drip, while in 'Contemporary Management of Chronic Persistent Cough', it is stated that patients may experience prolonged frustration, guilt and self-imposed social isolation, besides risking the medical and surgical complications of recurrent coughing episodes. Furthermore, in 'A Diagnostic Approach to \\'Difficult\\' Asthma', it is mentioned that patients with asthma do not respond adequately to standard treatment, they are said to have \\\"difficult\\\" asthma. These patients require a lot of healthcare resources, are usually receiving long-term oral corticosteroid therapy, and are significantly sicker than other asthma patients, with attendant increases in morbidity and mortality. In these patients, the management areas summarized in table 1 should be fully explored to determine whether asthma is the correct diagnosis and whether the best care is being given. Hence, we can conclude that Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (A), Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (B) and Long-term smoking (C) are recognized causes of chronic cough.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
