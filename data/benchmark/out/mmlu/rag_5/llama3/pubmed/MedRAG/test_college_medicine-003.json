["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the documents provided, we know that the resynthesis of phosphocreatine (PC) occurs rapidly after exercise, but is totally inhibited if the local circulation to the muscle is occluded. From 'The time course of phosphorylcreatine resynthesis during recovery of the quadriceps muscle in man', we can see that the fast component of PC resynthesis has a half-time of 21-22 seconds, and this accounts for a smaller fraction of the total PC restored during recovery from isometric contraction than after dynamic exercise. Therefore, the complete resynthesis of phosphocreatine after very high intensity exercise normally takes about 10 seconds, as the fast component of resynthesis occurs rapidly.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
