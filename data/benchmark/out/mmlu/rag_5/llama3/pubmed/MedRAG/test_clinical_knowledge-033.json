["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about calcium metabolism. The relevant documents mention calcitonin as a hormone that plays a central role in regulating calcium metabolism. Calcitonin causes a decrease in plasma calcium levels, not an increase. Primary hyperparathyroidism is associated with high levels of parathyroid hormone, which leads to increased resorption of bone and excretion of calcium in the urine, resulting in symptomatic hypercalcaemia.
