["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the transfer of blood from the venous side to the arterial side during the cardiac cycle. The key point is that this transfer results in a volume equivalent to ventricular stroke volume being transferred from the more compliant venous side to the less compliant arterial side of the circulation. This means that the venous pressure should decrease and the arterial pressure should increase. The question asks about pressures within the venous and arterial compartments, so we need to consider how these pressures change during this transfer.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
