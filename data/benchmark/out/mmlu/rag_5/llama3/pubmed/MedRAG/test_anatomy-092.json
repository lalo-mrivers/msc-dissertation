["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about laryngeal oedema being confined to the larynx above the vocal folds. We need to look for a document that discusses laryngeal edema and its location. The 'Laryngeal involvement in systemic lupus erythematosus' document seems relevant as it mentions laryngeal edema as one of the manifestations of SLE. According to this document, 28% of cases had laryngeal edema. It does not specify whether this edema is above or below the vocal folds, but it does mention that symptoms such as hoarseness, dyspnea, and vocal cord paralysis resolved with corticosteroid therapy. We cannot conclude from this document alone where the edema is located. However, we can look for other documents that discuss laryngeal edema and its location.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
