["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the documents provided, we can conclude that phosphocreatine plays a key role in intracellular energy transport from mitochondria to myofibrils. According to [Role of creatine phosphokinase in cellular function and metabolism], creatine phosphokinase isoenzymes are present mainly as cytosolic MM isoenzyme in skeletal muscle cells, with about 6% localized also in mitochondria. Therefore, we can deduce that phosphocreatine is primarily found in the cytoplasm.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
