["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents describe lactate production in human skeletal muscle during exercise. In 'Human skeletal muscle: participation of different metabolic activities in oxidation of L-lactate', it is mentioned that the pure mitochondrial fraction obtained from human skeletal muscle did not show coupled L-lactate (+ NAD) oxidation, but this function could be restored by addition of LDH. This suggests that lactate production may not require oxygen availability.\n\nIn 'Muscle metabolism during exercise: anaerobic threshold does not exist', it is stated that numerous studies showed that anaerobic glycolysis is not the cause of the enhanced accumulation of blood lactate during exercise. Increased lactate production is seen even in fully aerobic muscles, suggesting that lactate production may be independent of oxygen availability.\n\nIn 'Lactate release in relation to tissue lactate in human skeletal muscle during exercise', it is mentioned that the rate of lactate release rose approximately linearly with the muscle lactate concentration up to about 4-5 mmol/min but then the relationship revealed a clear leveling off. This suggests that lactate production may not be solely dependent on oxygen availability.\n\nIn 'Muscle fatigue and its relation to lactate accumulation and LDH activity in man', it is mentioned that differences between the two main muscle fibre types in muscle lactate, total LDH activity, and M-LDH activity were correlated to muscle fatigue. This suggests that lactate production may be related to glycolysis.\n\nIn 'Lactate transport in skeletal muscle cells: uptake in L6 myoblasts', it is mentioned that during exercise, lactate is produced by degradation of glucose-6-phosphate during glycolysis in the contracting muscles. This suggests that glycolysis may be a key factor in lactate production.\n\nBased on these findings, it seems that muscle lactate production increases when glycolysis is activated at the onset of exercise, and not necessarily when oxygen is readily available.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
