["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the most common cystic fibrosis mutation. According to the documents, it's mentioned that almost 70% of mutant chromosomes screened are caused by a major mutation described in 1989. It doesn't specify what type of mutation this is, but it does mention that over 150 additional mutations have been identified in the CFTR gene. However, one document highlights a specific nonsense mutation R1162X and another mentions a nonsense mutation R553X. This suggests that some cystic fibrosis mutations are indeed nonsense mutations. Therefore, considering all the information provided, the most common cystic fibrosis mutation is likely to be a nonsense mutation.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
