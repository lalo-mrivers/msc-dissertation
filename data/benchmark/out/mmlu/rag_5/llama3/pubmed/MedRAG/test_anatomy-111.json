["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents provide information on the anatomy of the sphenoid bone, including its relationships with surrounding structures. The foramina mentioned in the texts are: foramen ovale (in 'Microsurgical anatomy and dissection of the sphenoid bone, cavernous sinus and sellar region'), foramen rotundum (also in 'Microsurgical anatomy and dissection of the sphenoid bone, cavernous sinus and sellar region') and foramen spinosum (not explicitly mentioned but could be inferred from the context). Therefore, we can conclude that the foramina that pierce the sphenoid bone are at least the foramen ovale and rotundum. The presence of foramen spinosum is also possible.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
