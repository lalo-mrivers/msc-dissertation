["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about assessing arm reflexes. The provided documents are about processes controlling arm movements in monkeys, characteristics of motor programs underlying arm movements in monkeys, evidence of a contralateral motor influence on reciprocal inhibition in man, reflexes evoked in human thenar muscles during voluntary activity and their conduction pathways, and monosynaptic reflexes in the superficial forearm flexors in man and their clinical significance. None of these documents explicitly discuss assessing arm reflexes or provide information about biceps reflex root value, tendon tapping, or brisk finger jerks. Therefore, we need to make an educated guess based on general knowledge.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
