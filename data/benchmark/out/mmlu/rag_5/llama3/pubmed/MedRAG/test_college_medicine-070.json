["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents discuss the metabolism of amino acids, glucose, and lactate. Gluconeogenesis is mentioned as a process that converts substrates such as fructose, lactate, and pyruvate into glucose. The question asks about the synthesis of glucose from these same substrates. Therefore, it can be inferred that gluconeogenesis is the correct answer.\", \"answer_choice\": D}"]
