["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the effects of morphine on pain relief, side effects, and self-stimulation. The first document highlights individual variability in response to different opioids, including morphine. In the second document, morphine is shown to enhance bar pressing for low-intensity stimulation but fails to facilitate responding when a descending series was used, suggesting that adaptation can block its effects. The third document reports two patients who experienced severe side effects with intravenous morphine administration and subsequent improvement in pain relief and minimal side effects with epidural morphine administration. The fourth document presents a study of more than 100 fatal cases due to intravenously administered narcotics, including morphine. Finally, the fifth document provides an overview of pharmacological principles of pain management, including the use of opioid analgetic agents like morphine. From these documents, it is clear that morphine can reduce pain intensity but also has potential side effects.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
