["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about what happens when an action potential arrives at the motor endplate. We need to look for relevant information from the provided documents. In 'Neuromuscular actions of edrophonium', we learn that an action potential can cause release of acetylcholine (ACh) which traverses the neuromuscular junction. This is confirmed in 'On the role of barium' where ACh quanta are released asynchronously by nerve impulses. Therefore, it is likely that an action potential arriving at the motor endplate causes release of ACh.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
