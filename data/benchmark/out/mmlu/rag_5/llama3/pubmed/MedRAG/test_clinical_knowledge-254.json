["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents provide information on cuff width affecting indirect blood pressure measurements. The Hemodynamics of elevated blood pressure document mentions increased sympathetic drive and higher than normal heart rates in young hypertensives. Considering these points, we can analyze the options: A accurately estimating blood pressure implies no effect of arm level, which contradicts the information provided by 'The importance of cuff width in measurement of blood pressure indirectly'. B overestimation is also unlikely as it would require a different mechanism. C auscultatory gap is not related to arm levels but rather cuff placement and pressure waves. D underestimation is possible if the arm is above the heart level, which could reduce the blood pressure reading.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
