["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the types of sweat glands. From the provided documents, we know that eccrine cystadenoma is studied by electron microscopy and shows features characteristic of apocrine gland structure. Additionally, mammary adenoid cystic carcinoma presents as an exophytic mass with biphasic histologic composition, including tubular differentiation similar to a cutaneous tubular apocrine adenoma. Cell surface glycoproteins define distinct states of eccrine gland differentiation. These findings suggest that both eccrine and apocrine glands are types of sweat glands.\",\n\"answer_choice\": A"]
