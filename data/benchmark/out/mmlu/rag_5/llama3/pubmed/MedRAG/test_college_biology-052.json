["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about plant embryogenesis. The relevant documents mention the formation of the primary organization of the plant body in the early embryo, with the main types of plant tissue arising independently of pattern formation along the axis of polarity. This information suggests that precursors of all three plant tissue systems are formed during embryogenesis. The suspensor is also mentioned as being derived from the basal cell, but it does not seem to be directly related to the formation of shoot apical meristem or cotyledons. Therefore, we can conclude that option D is correct.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
