["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, we can infer that the genome refers to the entire DNA sequence of an organism. The first document mentions 'practical advantages as start points for making physical maps of genomes' and 'they also address biologically important regions of the genome'. This suggests that a genome is a comprehensive map of an organism's genetic material. Similarly, the second document talks about studying chromosome features to facilitate gene identification and isolation, implying that the genome is the entire DNA sequence. The third document provides an overview of the techniques used to study native genomes, further solidifying this interpretation. Finally, the fourth document discusses the evolution of genomes in different vertebrate classes, reinforcing the idea that a genome refers to the entire DNA sequence.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
