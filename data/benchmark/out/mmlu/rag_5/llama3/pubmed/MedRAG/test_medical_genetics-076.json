["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about a condition caused by a trinucleotide repeat expansion. We can look at the provided documents to find mentions of trinucleotide repeats and their corresponding diseases. In the document 'Triplet repeat mutations in human disease', we see that trinucleotide repeats are the sites of mutation in spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA), fragile X syndrome, and myotonic dystrophy (DM). This suggests that all three conditions are caused by trinucleotide repeat expansions. However, the question only asks about one condition. We can look at the document 'Correlation between CTG trinucleotide repeat length and frequency of severe congenital myotonic dystrophy' to see if it mentions the relationship between CTG repeats and myotonic dystrophy. The document states that the myotonic dystrophy (DM) mutation has recently been identified as an unstable trinucleotide CTG repeat which is present 5-30 times in the normal population but which is amplified up to 2,000 times in DM. This suggests that myotonic dystrophy is indeed caused by a trinucleotide repeat expansion.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
