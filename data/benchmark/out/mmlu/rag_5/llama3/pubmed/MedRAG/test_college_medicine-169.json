["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about mistakes being removed from the leading strand. Since this occurs shortly after RNA primer removal, it suggests that the mistake is a recent one. This implies that the error occurred during the process of DNA synthesis itself. Therefore, we can infer that the repair mechanism involved is responsible for correcting errors during DNA replication. Among the options, only Mismatch Repair Mechanism and Endonuclease Repair are directly related to correcting errors during DNA replication. Since the question specifically mentions removal of incorrect bases shortly after RNA primer removal, it suggests that this process occurs within a relatively short timeframe, making it more likely that the mismatch repair mechanism is involved.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
