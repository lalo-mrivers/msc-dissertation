["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The concept of 'passive movements' is related to the electrically driven hand splint mentioned in the first document. It seems that this term refers to a type of exercise where movement occurs without active effort from the subject, but rather through an external device. In the context of the report on the electrically driven hand splint, passive exercises were compared to conventional manual exercises for stiff fingers. The results showed a significant improvement in total active and passive motion in those fingers treated with the electrically driven splint. This suggests that passive movements can be effective in improving joint mobility. Based on this information, I will choose an answer.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B: Movement without resistance, stretching at end of range.\""]
