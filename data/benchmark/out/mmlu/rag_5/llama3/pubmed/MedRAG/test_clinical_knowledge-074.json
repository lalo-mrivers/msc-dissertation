["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks when muscle lactate production increases. In 'Lactate release in relation to tissue lactate in human skeletal muscle during exercise', it is stated that the release of lactate rose approximately linearly with the muscle lactate concentration up to about 4-5 mmol/min, and then the relationship revealed a clear leveling off. This suggests that muscle lactate production increases as the muscle lactate concentration increases. Additionally, in 'Muscle metabolism during exercise: anaerobic threshold does not exist', it is mentioned that increased lactate production is seen even in fully aerobic muscles. Therefore, we can conclude that muscle lactate production increases when glycolysis is activated at the onset of exercise.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
