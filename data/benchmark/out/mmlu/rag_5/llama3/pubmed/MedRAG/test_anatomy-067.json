["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the documents provided, we know that the brain stem contains premotor areas responsible for different types of eye movements. This suggests that there are separate pathways for skilled motor movements. We also know that the pyramids are a part of the oculomotor-related structures in the brain stem, which extend from the rostral mesencephalon to the hypoglossal nucleus in the caudal medulla. Therefore, it is unlikely that the skilled motor movements decussate in the pyramids. Instead, we can infer that they decussate in a different location. The only option that remains is C: skilled motor movements decussate in the pyramids.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
