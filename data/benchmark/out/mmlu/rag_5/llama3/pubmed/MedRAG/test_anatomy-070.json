["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the major concentrations of proprioceptive receptors providing information about position of the TMJ. We can refer to the documents that discuss the structure and function of the temporomandibular joint. The 'Clinical kinesthetic experiments on the lateral pterygoid muscle and temporomandibular joint in man' document states that a possible kinesthetic function of proprioceptors is found in the lateral pterygoid muscle as well as mechanoreceptors in the temporomandibular joint capsule. This suggests that the TMJ capsule has proprioceptive receptors.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
