["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the net production of ATP via substrate-level phosphorylation in glycolysis. The relevant documents discuss aerobic and anaerobic glycolysis, as well as energy metabolism in ischemic heart tissue. Substrate-level phosphorylation occurs in anaerobic glycolysis. According to the first document, anaerobic glycolysis produces lactate, ATP, and water but does not produce lactic acid. The ATP is produced through hydrolysis of ATP with release of hydrogen ions. This suggests that 2 ATP are produced from glucose via substrate-level phosphorylation in anaerobic glycolysis.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
