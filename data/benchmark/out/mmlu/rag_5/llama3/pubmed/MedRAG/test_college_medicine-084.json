["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents suggest that muscle fibers may be subdivided into type I (slow-twitch) and type II (fast-twitch) depending on their myosin adenosine triphosphatase activity. Type I fibers are utilized at low forces, whereas type II fibers are recruited in addition at high forces. The relaxation rate of type II fibers is twice as fast as that of type I fibers. This information suggests that the muscle fiber relaxes when the nerve stimulus is removed.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
