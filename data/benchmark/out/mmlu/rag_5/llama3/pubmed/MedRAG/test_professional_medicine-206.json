["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presented with symptoms of malaise, muscle and joint pain, and fever 3 days after the onset. He had undergone cadaveric renal transplantation resulting in immediate kidney function. The biopsy result shows intracellular inclusion bodies, which are characteristic of viral infection.

Corticosteroids are also immunosuppressive agents and increasing their dosage (choice A) might suppress the patient's immune system further. Amphotericin therapy (choice C) is typically used for fungal infections and ganciclovir therapy (choice D) is used to treat cytomegalovirus infection, but neither of these options are directly related to the patient's symptoms and biopsy findings.
