["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the main uses of the hand. The provided documents are mostly about handedness, grip patterns, and typing movements. However, one document mentions 'organization of sequential typing movements' which seems relevant to the question. Upon reviewing this document, I see that it discusses the movement patterns of fingers and wrists during typing. This is not directly related to the main uses of the hand, but it does imply a level of dexterity and coordination. The key point here is that humans are capable of complex movements with their hands, such as typing words. This complexity suggests that the hand has multiple uses.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
