["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the similarity between the wings of a bat and a butterfly. We need to consider the characteristics of both wings. Bats use their wings for flight, while butterflies use theirs primarily for gliding. The shape and structure of the wings are different due to these distinct functions. However, the concept of 'wing' is used in both cases, suggesting that there may be some underlying similarity. Upon reviewing the provided documents, we find discussions about wing membranes (in the first document) and imaginal wing discs (in the last document), which provide insights into the developmental processes involved. From these findings, it appears that the wings of a bat and a butterfly share some common ancestry, despite their differences in form and function.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
