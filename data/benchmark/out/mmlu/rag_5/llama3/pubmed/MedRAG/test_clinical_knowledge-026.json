["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the type of needle used for a specific procedure. Prostate needle biopsy is mentioned as one of the relevant procedures. The study 'Prostatic needle biopsy: comparison of needles' mentions two commonly used biopsy needles, but does not specify their gauge sizes. However, another document 'Malignant seeding of the tract after thin-needle aspiration biopsy' discusses fine-needle aspiration biopsy using a 25-gauge needle, which is considered thin. This suggests that smaller gauge needles (like 25-gauge) are suitable for finer procedures like aspiration biopsies. The question mentions a 14-16 gauge needle, which is larger than the one used in aspiration biopsies. Therefore, this type of needle is likely to be used for a different procedure, not for aspiration biopsies.\", \"answer_choice\": C}"]
