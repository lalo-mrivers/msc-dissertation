["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has active ankylosing spondylitis that is resistant to conventional nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and sulfasalazine. This suggests a need for more potent therapy. Sulfasalazines are primarily used for inflammatory bowel disease, but they have also been tried in rheumatoid arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis. In the context of ankylosing spondylitis, treatment with sulfasalazine has shown some benefit, although its long-term effect has not yet been evaluated.
