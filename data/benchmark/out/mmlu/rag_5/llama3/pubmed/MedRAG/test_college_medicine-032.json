["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The original sound emits from a medium with certain properties. When the sound exits this medium and enters a denser medium, we would expect changes in these properties. The density of the medium affects the velocity, intensity, frequency, and wavelength of the sound. Velocity is expected to decrease due to the increased density. Intensity may change as well, depending on the reflection or absorption of the sound by the new medium. Frequency remains constant, as it's a property of the source itself, not dependent on the medium. Wavelength, related to velocity and frequency, also remains constant.\n\nThe key here is that wavelength depends on both velocity and frequency. If we change the density (medium), velocity changes, but wavelength remains the same, as long as frequency stays the same.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
