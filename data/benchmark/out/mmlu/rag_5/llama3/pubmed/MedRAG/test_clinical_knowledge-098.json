["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to the provided documents, intense exercise is characterized by high ATP turnover rates. Fast-twitch oxidative glycolytic fibers display ATP turnover rates that are 2-4 times higher than those of slow-twitch oxidative fibers during near-maximum aerobic exercise. This suggests that the muscle's ATP store is depleted rapidly in high-intensity exercise. The review on regulation of muscle carbohydrate metabolism during exercise also highlights the rapid utilization of glycogen and glucose as substrates for glycolysis. Therefore, the ATP store in muscle can only supply energy in high-intensity exercise for a relatively short period.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
