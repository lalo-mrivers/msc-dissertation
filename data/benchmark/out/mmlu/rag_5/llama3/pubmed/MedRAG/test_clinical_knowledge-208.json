["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents discuss the use of analgesic drugs for pain management. Epidural administration of local anesthetics or morphine provides effective analgesia with minimal effects on motor and sympathetic pathways. Morphine antagonists like naloxone can be used to reverse the effects of morphine. The pharmacological relief of pain emphasizes the complexity of pain management, highlighting interpatient variability in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. Clinical pharmacokinetics of local anaesthetics show that certain agents are quickly metabolized or redistributed away from the brain, making them suitable for outpatient anesthesia.\n\nConsidering these points, it is important to individualize pain relief methods, taking into account the patient's specific needs and responses to drugs. This may involve giving drugs regularly with provision for additional 'as required' pain relief for breakthrough pain.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
