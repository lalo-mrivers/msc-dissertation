["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the genotype frequency of heterozygotes assuming Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Since the allele frequencies are 0.6 (major) and 0.4 (minor), we can use Hardy-Weinberg to calculate the expected genotype frequencies. The formula for calculating the genotype frequency of heterozygotes is p(1-p), where p is the frequency of one of the alleles (in this case, 0.4). Plugging in the value, we get 0.4*(1-0.4) = 0.16.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: 0.32\"\n}"]
