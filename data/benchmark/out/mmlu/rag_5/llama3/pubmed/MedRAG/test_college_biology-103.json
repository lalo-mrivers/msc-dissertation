["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the target of digestion of a nucleosome dimer to nucleosome monomers by DNase. The relevant information is provided in 'DNase-sensitive sites in nucleosomes'. According to this document, each endonuclease nicked nucleosome DNA at the identical sites, suggesting that the conformation of the DNA within a nucleosome is the major factor influencing its nuclease susceptibility. This indicates that the target of digestion by DNase is not the histones themselves but rather the linker DNA or the DNA wrapped around the core histone octamer.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
