["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The paper 'Synaptic function in the nervous system: a theory and its application' discusses the transformation of one form of nerve impulse into another.

This implies that the point at which an impulse is transmitted from one neuron to another neuron is within the synaptic region.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
