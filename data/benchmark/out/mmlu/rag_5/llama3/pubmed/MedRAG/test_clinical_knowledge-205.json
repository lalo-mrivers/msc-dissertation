["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, we can analyze the involuntary movements in the arm. The document 'Physiology of abnormal movements' discusses dyskinesias, which are disturbances of movement, power and tone of the limbs. The document 'Characteristics of motor programs underlying arm movements in monkeys' describes the processes controlling arm movements, including the role of afferent feedback. The document 'Electromyographic assessment of central motor disorders' presents experimental procedures for assessing central motor disorders. From these documents, we can deduce that dystonia is a type of dyskinesia characterized by involuntary muscle contractions and abnormal postures. A 'milkmaid' grip is sometimes found in dystonia. Writer's cramp is an example of a focal dystonia. Hemiballismus is a rare movement disorder that causes involuntary movements of the arm, but it is not caused by paralysis of the distal half of the arm.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
