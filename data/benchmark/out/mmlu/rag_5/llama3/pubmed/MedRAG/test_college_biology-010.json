["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the type of cleavage symmetry that arises from early cell divisions that occur at an oblique angle to the polar axis. The relevant documents mention different types of cell division and asymmetry establishment during embryogenesis, such as spatial patterns of cells in dividing epithelia and development of the left-right axis in amphibians. However, there is no specific information about cleavage symmetry arising from early cell divisions at an oblique angle to the polar axis. Therefore, we need to look for keywords that describe this phenomenon.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
