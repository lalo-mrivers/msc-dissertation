["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking how to ensure a large proportion of the drug reaches the lower airways when teaching a patient inhaler technique. The relevant documents suggest that only about 10% of the dose from an MDI actually reaches the lung, and that the site of deposition within the lung is influenced by the aerosol characteristics, interpatient variability, and the technique by which the patient uses the inhaler. Therefore, it is crucial to optimize drug delivery by altering the variables affecting inhalation. According to the 'Optimizing drug delivery from metered-dose inhalers' document, spacer devices have been designed to overcome some of the problems encountered with MDIs and may be beneficial in certain groups of patients.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
