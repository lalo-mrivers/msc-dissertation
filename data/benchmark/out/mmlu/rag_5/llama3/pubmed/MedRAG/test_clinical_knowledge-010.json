["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about compatible blood types for a person with blood group B (rhesus negative). Since the individual has Rhesus negativity, we focus on the Rh factor. Blood type B is already present in the person's blood, so we look for compatible blood groups that also have Rhesus negativity. Human-type A-B-O blood groups are mentioned in the documents, and there's no indication of a correlation between these and the Drh-graded system or Rhesus factors. Therefore, we can focus on the human-type blood groups. Since the person has blood group B, they can receive blood with the same or lower antigenic strength (i.e., ABO-blood group O). As for the Rh factor, since the individual is rhesus negative, only blood with the same Rh negativity will be compatible.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C\n}"]
