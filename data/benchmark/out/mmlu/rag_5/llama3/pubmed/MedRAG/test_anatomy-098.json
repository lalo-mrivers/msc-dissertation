["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the cause of macrostomia. The passage 'Percutaneous total reduction genioplasty' talks about macrogynia, which is a common cause of facial imbalance. This suggests that macrogynia and macrostomia are related conditions. In the same passage, it is mentioned that several procedures have been developed to deal with aspects of this problem, including percutaneous total reduction genioplasty. This procedure aims to correct facial imbalance caused by macrogynia. Since macrostomia results from failure of fusion of certain processes, we can infer that these processes are involved in the development of the face and mouth. The passage does not explicitly mention the names of the processes involved in macrostomia. However, based on our knowledge of human embryonic development, it is likely that maxillary and frontonasal processes are involved in the development of the mouth and face.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
