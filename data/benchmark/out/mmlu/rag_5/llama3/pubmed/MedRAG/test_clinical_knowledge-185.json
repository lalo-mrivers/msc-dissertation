["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the number of chromosomes in human somatic cells. We can look at the documents to find information related to this topic. In 'Chromosome structure and eukaryotic gene organization', it is mentioned that the DNA in the eukaryotic nucleus is highly compacted but well organized into distinct regional units, including chromosomal bands. It does not provide a specific number of chromosomes.\n\nIn 'Specific chromosome aberrations in senescent fibroblast cell lines derived from human embryos', we can find information about the number of chromosome aberrations increasing rapidly in these cells. However, it does not mention the total number of chromosomes.\n\nIn 'Cytogenetically marked clones in human fibroblasts cultured from normal subjects' and 'Chromosomal influence on hybrid cell proliferation', there is no relevant information provided.\n\nFinally, in 'A behavior of Y chromatin in cancer cells of males', we can find a statement about the presence of 46 chromosomes in human somatic cells. Therefore, based on this information, the answer to the question is likely D: 46.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
