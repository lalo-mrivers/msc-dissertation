["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the given documents, we can see that a noncompetitive inhibitor binds to an allosteric site on the enzyme and prevents it from catalyzing a reaction. This means that increasing the substrate concentration would have no effect on the binding of the noncompetitive inhibitor. On the other hand, uncompetitive inhibitors bind to the enzymesubstrate complex and prevent catalysis. Increasing the substrate concentration would increase the amount of the enzymesubstrate complex formed, which would strengthen the binding of the uncompetitive inhibitor. Therefore, increasing the substrate concentration would have an increasing effect on the impact of the uncompetitive inhibitor.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"]
