["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents discuss continuous flushing systems for radial artery cannulation and venous indwelling cannulae. The main benefit of the flushing device is a significant prolongation of catheter function and patency. This suggests that frequent flushing can help maintain patency and prevent complications. Impairment of flow in routine gravity-fed intravenous infusions can be caused by constriction of the cannulated vein, which can be prevented or minimized with continuous flushing. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that a cannula should be flushed frequently.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
