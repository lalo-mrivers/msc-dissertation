["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the properties of a killed vaccine relative to a live vaccine. The key point here is that we are dealing with a newly identified virus for which no vaccine exists yet. Since we don't have data on the reversion to virulence, rapid protective immunity, or mucosal immunity for this specific virus, we can rule out options B and D. Option C does not apply as it's generally true for vaccines in general, but we are looking for a property that specifically distinguishes killed from live vaccines. Therefore, the only remaining option is A: Avoids the concern for reversion to virulence.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
