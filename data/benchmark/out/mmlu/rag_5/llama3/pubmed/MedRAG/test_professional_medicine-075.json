["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has a history of progressive shortness of breath and nonproductive cough, with crackles heard in both lower lung fields. The pulmonary function tests show total lung capacity is 80% of predicted, and diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide, corrected for alveolar volume, is 65% of predicted. Considering the patient has systemic sclerosis (scleroderma), we can look at the literature for pulmonary involvement in scleroderma patients. The 'Pulmonary function in scleroderma' document suggests that a low diffusing capacity was most common in patients with restrictive disease, and SAD (small airway disease) was usually found in patients who had normal chest radiographs and no pulmonary symptoms.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
