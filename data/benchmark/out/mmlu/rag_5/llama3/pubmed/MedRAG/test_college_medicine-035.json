["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, it is important to understand that oxidative disposal refers to the process of releasing energy from macronutrients such as carbohydrates, fats, and proteins. The document 'Oxidative and nonoxidative macronutrient disposal in lean and obese men after mixed meals' highlights that glucose was preferentially oxidized, while fat was preferentially stored. This suggests that oxidative disposal is an important process for releasing energy from macronutrients.\n\nConsidering the options provided, we can evaluate which option releases most energy when completely oxidised in the body. Palmitic acid is a type of fatty acid and its complete oxidation would release more energy than glucose or other amino acids. Therefore, based on this information, it is likely that one gram of palmitic acid would release the most energy when completely oxidized.\n\nAdditionally, the document 'Oxygen free radicals and human diseases' provides some background on reactive oxygen species (ROS) which are constantly formed in the body and can be toxic if generated in excess. This highlights the importance of oxidative disposal in releasing energy from macronutrients.\n\nThe other options, glucose, leucine, and alcohol do not provide as much energy when completely oxidized compared to palmitic acid.\", \"answer_choice\": B}"]
