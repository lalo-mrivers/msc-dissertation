["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, intense exercise requires high energy turnover rates. Fast-twitch oxidative glycolytic fibers display ATP turnover rates that are 2-4 times higher than slow-twitch oxidative fibers during short-term, near-maximum aerobic exercise. This suggests that the ATP store in muscle is depleted rapidly during high-intensity exercise. Considering this information and the fact that muscle carbohydrate utilization is regulated primarily by delivery of substrate to the glycolytic pathway, it can be inferred that the ATP store in muscle can only supply energy in high-intensity exercise for a relatively short period.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
