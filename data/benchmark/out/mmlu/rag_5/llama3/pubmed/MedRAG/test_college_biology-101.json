["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The provided documents describe different types of algae, including green algae, blue-green algae (cyanobacteria), and red algae. Blue-green algae are able to dominate other algae due to their ability to excrete iron-selective chelators. Green algae have nuclei and cell walls. There is no mention of sulfur compound reduction or lack of cell walls in cyanobacteria. Therefore, the difference between cyanobacteria (blue-green algae) and green unicellular algae is not related to reducing sulfur compounds, lacking cell walls, or producing cell membranes.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
