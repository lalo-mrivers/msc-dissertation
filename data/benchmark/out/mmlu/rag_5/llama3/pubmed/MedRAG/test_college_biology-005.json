["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The Hardy-Weinberg law is a fundamental concept in population genetics that describes the equilibrium state of gene frequencies in a population. To operate with respect to a population, each of the following conditions must be met: 1) the population size is large (or infinite), 2) there is no migration or genetic exchange with other populations, 3) mating is random, and 4) there is no natural selection. This means that the only exception among the given options is A: Genes are exchanged with other populations.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
