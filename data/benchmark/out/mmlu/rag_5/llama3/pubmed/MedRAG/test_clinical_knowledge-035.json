["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks for the normal respiratory rate for an adult male. None of the provided documents specifically state a normal respiratory rate for an adult male. However, we can look at the 'Respiratory rates in pediatric emergency patients' study and see if there is any information that could be applied to adults. The study found that respiratory rate was inversely related to age, which means that as age increases, respiratory rate decreases. This suggests that an adult male's normal respiratory rate would likely be lower than a child's. We can also look at the 'Ultradian and other rhythms in human respiration rate' study, which mentions that most subjects demonstrated a 90 +/- 15 min rhythm of RR (respiratory rate), but this is not relevant to finding the normal respiratory rate for an adult male.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
