["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for the likelihood of an individual in a population carrying two specific alleles of a human DNA marker, each with a frequency of 0.2. To solve this, we need to find the probability of both alleles being present together. This can be done using the product rule of probability. The probability of the first allele is 0.2, and the probability of the second allele is also 0.2, since they are independent events. Therefore, the likelihood of an individual carrying both alleles is 0.2 * 0.2 = 0.04.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: 0.02\"\n}"]
