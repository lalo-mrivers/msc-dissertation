["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has suffered a CVA (cerebrovascular accident) in the left internal capsule, which conveys motor neurons to the right leg. The question asks about the expected effect on the patient's leg. This information is related to the pyramidal tract and its location in the internal capsule, as described in 'Location of human pyramidal tract in the internal capsule: anatomic evidence'. Since the lesion is in the left internal capsule, it would affect the motor neurons responsible for innervating the right leg. The effects on the patient's leg would be similar to those seen in patients with Wallerian degeneration of the pyramidal tract, as described in 'Motor responses after transcranial electrical stimulation of cerebral hemispheres with a degenerated pyramidal tract'.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A: spastic paralysis\"\n}"]
