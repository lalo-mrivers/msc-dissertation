["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the given documents, it can be seen that pseudocholinesterase deficiency is associated with atypical cholinesterase activity. In 'Atypical serum cholinesterase in the Netherlands', it is mentioned that heterozygosity for atypical cholinesterase was found in 14 cases out of 322 samples from unrelated, healthy blood donors. This suggests that pseudocholinesterase deficiency is present in individuals with atypical cholinesterase activity. Furthermore, in 'Succinylcholine sensitivity in a Nova Scotia family', it is mentioned that succinylcholine apnoea is usually the result of a delay in hydrolysis of the injected muscle relaxant due to the presence of an inherited defect in the enzyme cholinesterase, which includes atypical cholinesterase. Therefore, pseudocholinesterase deficiency is associated with increased sensitivity to succinylcholine.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
