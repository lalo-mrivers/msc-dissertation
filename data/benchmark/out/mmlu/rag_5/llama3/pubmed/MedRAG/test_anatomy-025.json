["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the substances found in greater quantity in exhaled air. We can look at the documents to find the answers. From 'Characterization of human expired air', we know that the profiles provide valuable baseline information upon which suitable correlation studies may be advanced toward the use of human expired air for diagnostic purposes. This suggests that the concentration of certain substances in exhaled air is important.\n\nFrom 'Ion-trap detection of volatile organic compounds in alveolar breath', we learn about a method for collecting and microanalyzing the volatile organic compounds in human breath. We can see that carbon dioxide is one of the substances analyzed.\n\nIn 'Reproducibility of measurements of trace gas concentrations in expired air', we find information about the measurement of hydrogen, methane, carbon monoxide, and carbon dioxide. This suggests that these substances are present in exhaled air and their concentrations can be measured.\n\nFinally, from 'Severe airway disease due to inhalation of fumes from cleansing agents', we learn about a subject who had severe airway obstruction and evidence of small-airway disease resulting from inhalation of 'fumes' liberated during the course of mixing several drain-cleansing agents. This doesn't provide direct information on the substances found in exhaled air, but it suggests that the composition of exhaled air can be important for diagnostic purposes.\n\nPutting all this together, we can see that carbon dioxide is one of the substances analyzed and its concentration can be measured in exhaled air.\", \n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
