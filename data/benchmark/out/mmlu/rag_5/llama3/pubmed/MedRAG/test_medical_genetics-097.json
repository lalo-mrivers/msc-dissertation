["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the proportion of variation in body mass index (BMI) explained by known SNPs. The relevant documents mention heritability estimates from twin studies, which suggest that there are both genetic and environmental causes of obesity. Heritability of stature in a West African population is also mentioned, with an estimate of 0.6. Linkage analysis of quantitative traits highlights the importance of selected samples for detecting major loci. This information suggests that while there may be a significant genetic component to BMI variation, it is not fully explained by known SNPs.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
