["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking which of the given agents will induce polyploidy in a dividing eukaryote. We need to look for the relevant information from the provided documents that relate to this topic. From the Mechanisms of spontaneous and induced heteroploidization and polyploidization, we learn that untreated cell populations can form cells with different chromosome numbers through mitotic non-disjunction. This is not specific to a particular agent. However, in the Induction of multipolar spindle in Allium sativum, it is mentioned that aureofungin (a polyene antifungal antibiotic) causes chromosomal abnormalities and alters the spindle leading to multipolar condition, which can lead to polyploidy. This suggests that certain antibiotics like aureofungin may induce polyploidy. In the Polyploidy of the bone marrow, it is mentioned that cystostatic drugs increase the frequency of polyploid cells being formed. Finally, in the Polyploidy induction as a consequence of topoisomerase inhibition, we learn that topoisomerase II inhibitors like Adriamycin can induce polyploidy by blocking cell cycle progression and leading to G2-blocked cells. This suggests that certain chemotherapy agents like Adriamycin may also induce polyploidy.\", \"answer_choice\": B}"]
