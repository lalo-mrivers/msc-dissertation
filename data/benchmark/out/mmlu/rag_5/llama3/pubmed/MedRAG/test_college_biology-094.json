["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the protein that encodes the src oncogene. The relevant documents mention phosphorylation of c-Src on tyrosine 527 by another protein tyrosine kinase. This suggests that the src oncogene is related to a protein tyrosine kinase. Additionally, the documents describe the specificity of an enzyme that phosphorylates tyrosine 527 of p60c-src. This enzyme has conserved regions similar to kinases of the src family and lacks phosphorylation sites corresponding to tyrosines 416 and 527 of p60c-src. Therefore, it is likely that this protein-tyrosine kinase is encoded by the src oncogene.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
