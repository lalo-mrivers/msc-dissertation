["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about Signal Detection Theory, which is related to the detection of visual cues. In this case, the team of engineers is trying to determine the brightness needed for the pilot to detect the tower at 1 mile away. The pilot says he cannot see the light when he is 1 mile away from the tower. This suggests that the pilot did not detect the signal (light) even though it was present. In Signal Detection Theory, this would be referred to as a 'Miss'.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
