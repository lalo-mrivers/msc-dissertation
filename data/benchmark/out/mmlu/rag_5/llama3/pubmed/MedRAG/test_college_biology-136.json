["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the inheritance pattern of linked genes that produce a gray body and normal wings (gray-bodied) or a black body and vestigial wings (black-bodied). The presence of flies with both gray bodies and vestigial wings among the progeny suggests that there is some degree of recombination between these two linked genes. This recombination can occur through crossing over, which is a process where genetic material from non-sister chromatids is exchanged during meiosis.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
