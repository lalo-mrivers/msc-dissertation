["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The pupillary light reflex refers to the constriction of the pupil when light enters the eye. This reflex is mediated by the afferent pathway which carries the information from the retina to the brain, and then the efferent pathway which sends the signal back to the ciliary muscle to constrict the pupil. The relevant document discussing the pupillary examination mentions that stimulation with light causes segmental constriction of the pupil, which is consistent with the normal pupillary light reflex.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
