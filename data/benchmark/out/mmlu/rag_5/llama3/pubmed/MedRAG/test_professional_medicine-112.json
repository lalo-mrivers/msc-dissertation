["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 16-year-old male with sudden-onset swelling of the right knee. He denies trauma but has a past medical history of cystic fibrosis. The physical examination reveals fluctuance on palpation, mild restriction in range of motion, and numerous bruises. Easy bruising and bleeding from the gums are also noted. This suggests a bleeding disorder or coagulopathy.\n\nThe patient's history of easy bruising and bleeding from the gums over the past month makes acquired factor VIII deficiency more likely. Cystic fibrosis is not directly related to bleeding disorders, but it may be associated with malabsorption of fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, and K), which could contribute to a coagulopathy.\n\nDiffuse intravascular coagulation secondary to infection is less likely given the absence of increased warmth in the knee joint. Hypocomplementemia is also not directly related to the patient's symptoms.\n\nTherefore, acquired factor VIII deficiency is the most likely explanation for the patient's findings.\",\n\"answer_choice\": A"]
