["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the changes that occur with an increasing number of sprints. According to the document 'Changes in force production, blood lactate and EMG activity in the 400-m sprint', it can be seen that as the distance increases (100-, 200-, 300- and 400-m), the peak BLa increases and the rate of BLa accumulation decreases with running distance (P less than 0.001). This indicates an increasing anaerobic contribution, which is in line with the expected physiological response to sprinting.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
