["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Exon skipping is a phenomenon where an exon is skipped during mRNA splicing. In the provided documents, we see examples of exon skipping in different contexts. The first document describes how 5' splice site mutations can lead to exon skipping. The second document shows how phosphorothioate substitution can inhibit spliceosome formation and splicing, leading to exon skipping. The third document describes a naturally occurring mutation that results in exon skipping and causes severe immunodeficiency. Finally, the fourth document shows how prevalent skipping of an individual exon can account for shortened protein 4.1 Presles. Based on these examples, it is clear that exon skipping is associated with changes in the RNA processing pathway, particularly mutations that affect splice sites or the splicing process itself.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
