["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about polygenic Alzheimer disease, which means it's talking about late-onset Alzheimer disease. We know from the documents that early-onset Alzheimer disease (EOAD) has been linked to mutations in the APP gene on chromosome 21, as well as a locus on chromosome 14 near markers D14S43 and D14S53. Late-onset Alzheimer disease is likely polygenic, meaning it's influenced by multiple genetic factors. The document 'Clinical genetics and genetic counseling in Alzheimer disease' mentions that late-onset Alzheimer disease may be more complex than initially suspected, with a heritable predisposition to disease only apparent in families with large numbers of elderly relatives at risk. This suggests that multiple genes might contribute to the development of late-onset Alzheimer disease.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
