["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about a successful inferior alveolar nerve block. The relevant document is 'Electrophysiological assessment of human inferior alveolar nerve function'. This study describes the technique for making electrophysiological recordings from the inferior alveolar nerve of conscious human subjects. Recordings were obtained from 6 of 10 subjects, with consistent waveform latencies and amplitudes across subjects. The neurogenic origin of the responses was verified by blocking the nerve with 2% xylocaine, resulting in a loss of the waveform.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B\n}"]
