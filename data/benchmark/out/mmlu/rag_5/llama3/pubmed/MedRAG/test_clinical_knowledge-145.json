["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the function of sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) in muscle cells. The given documents discuss various aspects of SR, including calcium binding proteins and their role in regulating muscle contraction. Calcium ions are released from SR into the myofibril to interact with troponin, leading to muscle contraction. This suggests that SR is involved in calcium storage and release, which is supported by other papers.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
