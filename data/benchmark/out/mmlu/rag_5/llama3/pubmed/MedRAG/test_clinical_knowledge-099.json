["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Since the dosage of Cotrimoxazole is prescribed every 12 hours, we need to find out how many times this dose is taken within a day. A day has 24 hours, and since each dose is given every 12 hours, we can divide 24 by 12 to get the number of doses in a day. This will be 2 doses (24 รท 12 = 2). Since each dose is 960 mg, we multiply this amount by the number of doses to find out the daily dose. So, 960 mg ร 2 doses = 1920 mg.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
