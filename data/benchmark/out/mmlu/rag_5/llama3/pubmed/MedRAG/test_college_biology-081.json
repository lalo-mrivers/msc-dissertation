["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents describe methods for determining protein binding to specific DNA sequences. The probing information content of DNA-binding sites and the determination of recognition-sequences for DNA-binding proteins by a polymerase chain reaction assisted binding site selection method (BSS) using nitrocellulose immobilized DNA binding protein both involve identifying specific DNA sequences bound by proteins. Similarly, the use of DNA-protein interaction to isolate specific genomic DNA sequences involves identifying DNA sequences recognized by DNA-binding proteins.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
