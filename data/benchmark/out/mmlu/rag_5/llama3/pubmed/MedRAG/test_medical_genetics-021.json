["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe X-chromosome inactivation as a unique developmental event that results in the transcriptional inactivation of most genes on one of the two X chromosomes in female mammals. It is mentioned that this event occurs twice during the mammalian life cycle, once in females and again in males. The document also mentions that XIST transcripts are produced from somatic inactivated X chromosomes. Therefore, it can be inferred that X-chromosome inactivation results in genetically turning off one of the two X chromosomes in female mammals.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
