["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the stage of mitosis that corresponds to the dissolution of nucleoli. The passage 'The role of nuclei and nucleoli in the control of cell proliferation.' mentions that changes occur in chromatin of quiescent cells stimulated to proliferate, including increased transcriptional activity in the early prereplicative phase. This increase is attributed to an increased activity of the nucleolus. Therefore, it can be inferred that the dissolution of nucleoli occurs during the prophase stage of mitosis.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
