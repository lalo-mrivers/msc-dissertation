["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about bronchial breathing. We need to look for relevant information on the documents provided. Document 1 talks about lung function testing in adults with preferential nasal breathing and does not provide information on bronchial breathing. Document 2 discusses the structure and function of small airways, but it's not directly related to bronchial breathing either. Document 3 describes different flow patterns in tracheal stenosis, bronchospasm, and emphysema, which is useful for our question. Document 4 talks about variations in bronchial movement during routine bronchography. This document provides the most relevant information for our question. It describes that on full inspiration and extreme expiration, wide variations of calibre were demonstrated on full inspiration and extreme expiration, most marked in the smaller bronchi. During coughing, maximal differences of width were noted in the larger airways, with little change in the smallest bronchi.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
