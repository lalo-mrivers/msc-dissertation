["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"After reviewing the provided documents, I noticed that chronic fatigue syndrome is characterized by profound fatigue. In 'Adaptation to fatigue of long duration in human wrist movements', it is mentioned that subjects adapted to low-frequency fatigue by changing the neural patterns controlling their muscles. This suggests that alterations in neurotransmitters may play a role in fatigue development.\n\nIn 'Behavioural pharmacology of 5-HT3 receptor ligands', it is stated that selective 5-HT3 receptor antagonists can reduce hyperactivity and enhance cognitive performance, which implies that serotonin (a type of neurotransmitter) may be involved in fatigue development.\n\nHowever, I did not find any direct evidence linking dopamine to fatigue development. The documents do mention dopamine's role in the modulation of behaviour, but this is not directly related to fatigue.\n\nLastly, acetyl choline and noradrenaline are mentioned as neurotransmitters in 'Using cerebral stimulants to treat minimal brain dysfunction', but there is no clear indication that they influence fatigue development.\n\nBased on this analysis, I believe that serotonin may be involved in fatigue development.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
