["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The document 'Preoperative evaluation of patients with bladder outlet obstruction with particular regard to excretory urography' explains that preoperative excretory urography is used to detect abnormalities in the upper urinary tract and the bladder. This suggests that bladder washout may be necessary when there are issues with the bladder, such as residual urine after prostatectomy. The document 'An explanation for the persistence of residual urine after external sphincterotomy' also explains that patients who fail to sustain bladder contraction may have residual urine in excess of 80 ml. This information suggests that a patient at home may need a bladder washout when they experience persistent residual urine, which is not related to the clarity or blockage of their catheter.\", \"answer_choice\": C}"]
