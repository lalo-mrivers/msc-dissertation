["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, we need to write the balanced equation for the reaction. We can do this by determining the number of moles of each reactant and then using the atomic weights to find the molecular weight. Next, we can calculate the mass of carbon dioxide produced based on the limiting reagent and the mole ratio.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
