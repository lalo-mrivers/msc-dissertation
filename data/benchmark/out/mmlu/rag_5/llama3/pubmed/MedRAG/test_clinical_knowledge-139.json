["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks for the 'normal' range of flexion at the knee joint. From the documents provided, we can find information about the normal patterns of torque versus time, force-velocity relations and fiber composition in human knee extensor muscles, increase of muscle strength from isometric quadriceps exercises at different knee angles, awareness of knee joint angle under static conditions, and in vivo knee stability. The relevant document for this question seems to be 'Increase of muscle strength from isometric quadriceps exercises at different knee angles' which reports the maximal torque was measured in both positions before and after training in 10 healthy females. Both legs were exercised, one at each position. The purpose was to develop practical recommendations for choice of training position. The strength increase was mainly specific according to the angle at which the knee was exercised.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
