["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the ratio of purines to pyrimidines in a double-stranded molecule of DNA. The relevant documents describe the formation of triple helices between RNA oligonucleotides and double-helical DNA, as well as the properties of these complexes. There is no information provided that suggests a genetic determination or a fixed 1:1 ratio. Therefore, we can conclude that the ratio is variable.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
