["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to the provided documents, we can see that RNA is composed of nucleotide bases. In the document 'How many anticodons? Much new information on codon composition is becoming available from the sequencing of molecules of DNA and RNA.', it is mentioned that the 'wobble rules' for codon-anticodon pairing are applicable to this information. This implies that RNA also has a similar structure as DNA. In the document '[Contribution of individual structural components to stabilization of the secondary structure of double-helical polynucleotides]', it is discussed about the structure and energy function of double-helical polynucleotides, which includes RNA. Therefore, we can conclude that RNA has a similar composition as DNA, with bases such as Adenine, Guanine, Uracil, and Cytosine. Thymine is not found in RNA because it is specific to DNA.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
