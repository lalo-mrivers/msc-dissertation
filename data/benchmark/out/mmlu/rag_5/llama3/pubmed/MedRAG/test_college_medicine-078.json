["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question describes a situation where the scientist stimulates neurons in the hypothalamus and observes a sharp rise in membrane potential. The first stimulation causes a 100mV difference in membrane potential. When the second stimulation is attempted immediately after the first, there is no response. This suggests that the neurons are in a refractory period after being depolarized by the first stimulus. Increasing the voltage for the second shock allows it to overcome the refractoriness and cause another depolarization.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
