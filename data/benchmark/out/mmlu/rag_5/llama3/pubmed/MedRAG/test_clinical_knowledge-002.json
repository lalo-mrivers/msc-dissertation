["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Upon reviewing the relevant documents, we can see that Alzheimer's disease is mentioned as one of the most common forms of dementia in the first document 'Studies on the incidence of dementia: the European perspective'. This suggests that it could be a common cause of dementia. Additionally, the second document 'A rational approach to dementia' does not specifically mention which type of dementia is most common. However, the third document 'Incidence of dementia: preliminary findings from the Nottingham Longitudinal Study of Activity and Ageing' provides more specific information on age-specific rates of dementia, but it does not provide information on the commonest cause of dementia. The fourth document 'Neurological investigation of dementia' does not provide direct information on the commonest cause of dementia. Finally, the fifth document 'The MRC Multicentre Study of Cognitive Function and Ageing: a EURODEM incidence study in progress' is a description of a study methodology and does not provide direct information on the commonest cause of dementia. Therefore, based on the available information, Alzheimer's disease appears to be the most likely answer.\",\n\"answer_choice\": A"]
