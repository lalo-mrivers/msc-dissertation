["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 17-year-old girl who has been stung by a bee. She has mild lightheadedness but no difficulty swallowing. Her vital signs are within normal limits except for tachycardia (100/min). She also has bilateral wheezing on auscultation of the chest, which suggests an allergic reaction. We need to look for treatments that address bronchospasm and potential anaphylaxis. The relevant documents suggest terbutaline aerosol as a effective bronchodilator agent with at least a seven-hour duration of action in patients with reversible obstruction of the airways. This also addresses her wheezing. Epinephrine is another option but it's not specified if she has a history of asthma or not. The documents suggest epinephrine lowers blood pressure and heart rate, which doesn't seem to be the best approach for this patient. Therefore, the most appropriate pharmacotherapy would be a Î²2-Adrenergic agonist like terbutaline.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
