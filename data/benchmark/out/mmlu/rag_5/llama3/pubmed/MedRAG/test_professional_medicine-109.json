["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is presenting with a 2-week history of recurrent, widespread blister formation. The blisters are most numerous in the flexural areas, including the axillae and groin. There are no oral lesions. This suggests that the condition is not erythema multiforme, as that typically has oral involvement. Recurrent cutaneous herpes simplex can cause widespread blisters, but the patient's symptoms do not fit the typical description of that condition. Cutaneous bacterial infections can cause blisters, but the presence of blisters in flexural areas without oral lesions makes this less likely. Porokeratosis is characterized by keratin-filled canals in the epidermis and typically presents as solitary or multiple lesions on sun-exposed skin. This does not seem to fit the patient's symptoms either. Factitious (self-inflicted) skin wounds could cause widespread blisters, but there is no indication of self-harm or manipulation of the wounds.\n\nThe only explanation left is adhesion failure involving the basement membrane. The basement membrane is a thin layer of specialized epithelial and endothelial cells that separates the epidermis from the dermis. Failure of this adhesion can lead to blistering. This is supported by the widespread nature of the blisters, their resistance to breaking, and the absence of oral lesions.\n\n\",\n\"answer_choice\": A\n}"]
