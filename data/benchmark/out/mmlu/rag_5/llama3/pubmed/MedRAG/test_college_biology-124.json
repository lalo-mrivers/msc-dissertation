["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about a fixed action pattern shown by animals. From the provided documents, I can see that there is no direct mention of fixed action patterns. However, I can infer that it might be related to behavioral responses or conditioned responses. In the document 'Organization of brainstem behavioral systems', it mentions behaviors elicited from sites in the caudal brainstem, which evidence unexpected goal specificity and stimulus control over response topography. This might be related to a fixed action pattern. Furthermore, the document 'Reinforcement' in behavior theory talks about operant conditioning, which involves the learning of new responses through reinforcement. This could also be related to fixed action patterns.\", \n\"answer_choice\": \"B: is a motor response which once released may be terminated spontaneously\"\n}"]
