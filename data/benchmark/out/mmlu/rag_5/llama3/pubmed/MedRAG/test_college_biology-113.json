["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the rate of reduction of acetaldehyde to ethanol in the presence of alcohol dehydrogenase. Since the rate reaches a maximum and then remains unaffected by further increases in acetaldehyde concentration, it suggests that the enzyme is saturated with substrate (acetaldehyde). This means that nearly all enzyme molecules are interacting with acetaldehyde molecules.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
