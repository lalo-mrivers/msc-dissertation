["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 15-year-old girl with a 3-month history of acne. She has Tanner stage 5 breast and pubic hair development, indicating androgen-dependent features. Menarche occurred at age 14 years, suggesting normal pubertal progression. The physical examination shows scattered open and closed comedones over the cheeks and forehead, which is consistent with acne.\n\nFrom the given documents, we can see that androgens are involved in acne formation (Acne in pubertal boys undergoing treatment with androgens). Additionally, gynaecomastia and hirsutism are also related to androgenic effects. Given the patient's androgen-dependent features, it is likely that androgens play a role in her acne.\n\nThe other options do not seem to be directly related to the development of acne in this patient. Increased estrogen stimulation of sebaceous glands might lead to a different type of skin issue, while increased responsiveness to follicle-stimulating hormone could affect ovarian function rather than acne. Sympathetic stimulation would likely affect multiple systems and does not specifically relate to acne.\n\nTherefore, considering all the evidence, the most likely underlying cause of this patient's acne is D: Stimulation of sebaceous glands by androgens.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
