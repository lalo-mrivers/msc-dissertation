["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the final velocity of water as it exits from a fire hydrant with a nozzle that decreases the area of the water exiting to create a more forceful stream. The starting velocity is given as 2 m/s, and pressure is kept constant. We can use Bernoulli's principle to relate the velocity, density, and pressure of the fluid. Since the pressure is constant, we can ignore it for now. The area of the nozzle is 1/3 of the original area, which means the velocity will increase by a factor proportional to the square root of the ratio of the areas. Therefore, the final velocity will be higher than the starting velocity.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B\n}"]
