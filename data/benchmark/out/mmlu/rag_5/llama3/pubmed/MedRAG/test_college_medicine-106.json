["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the effects of circulatory occlusion on muscle energy metabolism and resynthesis of creatine phosphate. They also discuss abnormal high-energy phosphate metabolism in phosphofructokinase deficiency. Anaerobic recovery in man is described, where anaerobic glycolysis occurs to resynthesize high-energy phosphate stores depleted during supramaximal exercise.\n\nThe question asks about products of ADP degradation that increase in concentration in the blood during multiple sprint sports. From the information provided, we can see that ADP degrades into AMP, which is then converted into ammonia and other compounds through various pathways.\n\nIn phosphofructokinase deficiency, ammonia (NH3) increases approximately twofold more in venous effluent during maximal forearm exercise compared to healthy subjects. This suggests that ammonia is a product of ADP degradation that increases in concentration during high-intensity exercise.\n\nAdditionally, anaerobic glycolysis occurs during supramaximal exercise and recovery, where lactate and other products are produced. However, this process does not directly relate to the question about products of ADP degradation increasing in concentration.\n\nBased on the information provided, we can conclude that ammonia is a product of ADP degradation that increases in concentration in the blood during multiple sprint sports.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B: Ammonia, urea and uric acid.\""]
