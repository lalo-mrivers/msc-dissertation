["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant document for this question is 'Faster adjustment of O2 uptake to the energy requirement of exercise in the trained state.' This study measures VO2 continuously on a breath-by-breath basis. To calculate energy expenditure, we need to know that 1 liter of oxygen (VO2) is equivalent to approximately 4.83 kcal or about 20.39 kJ. The athlete's steady-rate oxygen uptake averages 3.0 l/min for 5 minutes of exercise. We need to convert the VO2 from liters per minute to liters per 5 minutes, then multiply by 20.39 kJ/liter. Finally, we can calculate the total energy expenditure.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
