["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the type of mutation that causes achondroplasia. We can look at relevant documents to find information about the genetic studies in thanatophoric dwarfism and the biochemical abnormalities underlying morphologic abnormalities in skeletal dysplasias. In a separate document, we see an estimate of the mutation rate of achondroplasia based upon recent newborn studies. This suggests that achondroplasia is a dominant disorder. Therefore, the mutations that cause achondroplasia can be classified as\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A: dominant negative\""]
