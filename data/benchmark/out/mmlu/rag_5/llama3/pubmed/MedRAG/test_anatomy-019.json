["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the structure and function of the lung, including gas exchange between air spaces and capillary blood. The primary determinants of pulmonary disease are environmental factors such as inhaled allergens, carcinogens, toxic particles, and microorganisms.
