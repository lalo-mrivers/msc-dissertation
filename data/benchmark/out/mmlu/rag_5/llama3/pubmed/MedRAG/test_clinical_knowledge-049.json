["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the transport of free fatty acids (FFA) in the blood. In Diminished plasma free fatty acid clearance in obese subjects, it is mentioned that clearance of FFA, probably denoting esterification in tissues such as muscle and adipose tissue, is impaired in obesity. This suggests that FFA are transported to these tissues where they are esterified. The same document also mentions that lipolysis, measured as net transport of FFA, is suppressible with glucose and insulin in the obese. In Demonstration of two pools of albumin-bound fatty acids, it is described how albumin-bound nonesterified fatty acids and radioactive palmitic acid complexed to albumin were taken up by the isolated perfused rat liver. This suggests that albumin-bound FFA are transported to tissues. Therefore, we can conclude that most of the free fatty acids are transported in the blood bound to albumin.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
