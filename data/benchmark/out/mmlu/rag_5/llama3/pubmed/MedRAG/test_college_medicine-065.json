["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the ratio of purines to pyrimidines in a double-stranded DNA molecule. This information can be found in the first document which describes the structure and stability of triple helices formed by RNA oligonucleotides and their 2'-O-methyl derivatives binding to double-helical DNA. The document states that pyrimidine oligoribonucleotides bind to the major groove of double-helical DNA at homopurine.homopyrimidine sequences, recognizing Watson-Crick base pairs by forming T.A x U and C.G x C base triplets via Hoogsteen hydrogen bonding. This suggests that there is no specific constraint on the ratio of purines to pyrimidines in a double-stranded DNA molecule.\",\n\"answer_choice\": A"]
