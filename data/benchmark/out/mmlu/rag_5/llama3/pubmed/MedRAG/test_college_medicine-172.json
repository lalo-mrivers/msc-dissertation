["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the permeability of the descending loop of Henle to a substance. According to the document 'NH4+ transport in the kidney', NH4+ can penetrate the paracellular pathway in some nephron segments such as the proximal tubule and thick ascending limb. The descending loop of Henle is part of the thick ascending limb. Therefore, it can be inferred that the descending loop of Henle is permeable to NH4+. However, there is no information provided about the permeability of the descending loop of Henle to Na+, H2O, K+, or Cl-.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
