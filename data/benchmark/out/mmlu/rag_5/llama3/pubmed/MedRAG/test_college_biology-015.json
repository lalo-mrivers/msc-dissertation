["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the events that occur after a rise in intracellular free calcium in the sea urchin oocyte. The passage 'A rapid change in phosphorylation on tyrosine accompanies fertilization of sea urchin eggs.' suggests that calcium signaling at fertilization involves changes in protein phosphorylation, particularly phosphorylation on tyrosine. This event is related to cell activation and signal transduction. Therefore, the answer must be related to the events that occur after fertilization. The passage 'Unmasking' of stored maternal mRNAs and the activation of protein synthesis at fertilization in sea urchins.' suggests that translational machinery as well as mRNA is activated following fertilization. Therefore, the answer cannot be related to polyspermy prevention, which occurs before fertilization. Instead, it must be related to events that occur after fertilization.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
