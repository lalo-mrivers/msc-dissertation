["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking why enzymes are effective in facilitating chemical reactions. Enzymes are biological molecules that speed up chemical reactions by lowering the activation energy required for the reaction to occur. The relevant documents discuss enzyme mechanism dissection, protein engineering, and site-directed mutagenesis, which all point towards the idea that enzymes alter the geometry of the active site to facilitate catalysis. Therefore, option D: They lower the activation energy, thereby speeding up the conversion of reactants to products, is the best explanation.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
