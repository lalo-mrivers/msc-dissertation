["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the developmental defects that occur when homeotic cluster genes are mutated in Drosophila. From the given documents, we know that homeotic genes determine which structures form in each of the body segments and that disrupting their function causes body parts found in one domain to be replaced by body parts normally found elsewhere. This suggests that mutations in homeotic cluster genes would result in defects related to the formation or transformation of body segments.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
