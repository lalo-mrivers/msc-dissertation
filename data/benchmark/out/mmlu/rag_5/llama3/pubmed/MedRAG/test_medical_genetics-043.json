["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe various types of mutations, including nonsense mutations. In 'Correlation of nonsense sites in the lacI gene with specific codons in the nucleotide sequence', it is mentioned that over 80 cases of nonsense mutations can be identified by examining the underlying nucleotide sequence. This suggests that a nonsense mutation is characterized by the creation of a stop codon, which would terminate translation and result in a truncated protein.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
