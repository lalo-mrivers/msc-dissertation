["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to the provided documents, spontaneous mutations occur at a low rate due to errors in DNA replication. Imperfect nearby repeats can mutate to form perfect repeats, which may create small repeats in genomic DNA. Additionally, perturbation of dNTP pools can alter frameshift fidelity during DNA synthesis, leading to an increase in error rates. These processes suggest that mutations can occur spontaneously without the presence of carcinogens.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
