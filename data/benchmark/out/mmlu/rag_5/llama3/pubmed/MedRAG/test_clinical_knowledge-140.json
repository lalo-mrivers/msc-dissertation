["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking which option is not a controlled drug. I will analyze each option to determine if it is a controlled drug or not.\n\nOption A: Codeine Phosphate for injection - This is a controlled drug, as it contains codeine, a Schedule III controlled substance.\n\nOption B: Sustained release Morphine tablet - Morphine is a Schedule II controlled substance. Therefore, this option is also a controlled drug.\n\nOption C: Fentanyl patch - Fentanyl is a Schedule II controlled substance. Thus, this option is another controlled drug.\n\nOption D: Morphine 10 mg in 5 ml oral suspension - Morphine is a Schedule II controlled substance. This option is therefore also a controlled drug.\n\nAfter analyzing each option, I found that none of the options are not controlled drugs. However, one option stands out as being particularly potent and highly regulated: Fentanyl patch (Option C).\",\n\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
