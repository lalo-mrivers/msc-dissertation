["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks for the expected incidence of affected homozygous females if an X-linked recessive disorder is in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium and the incidence in males equals 1 in 100. Since it's an X-linked recessive disorder, we need to consider the population genetics of fragile X syndrome. The relevant document 'Notes on the population genetics of fragile X syndrome' provides the key information needed to solve this problem. Specifically, we can use the formula from [Estimation of the frequency of recessive X-chromosome-associated traits among females] to estimate the expected incidence of affected homozygous females.\n\nAccording to this formula, the expected proportion of female carriers is equal to 1 / (4f + 3), where f is the fertility of the carrier. Since we are given that the incidence in males equals 1 in 100, we can use this information to calculate the probability of a male being affected by the disorder.\n\nLet p be the probability of a male being affected by the disorder. Then, since the incidence in males equals 1 in 100, we have p = 0.01. Since the disorder is X-linked recessive, only females who are homozygous for the recessive allele will be affected. Therefore, the expected proportion of female carriers can be calculated as follows:\n\nExpected proportion of female carriers = 1 / (4f + 3) = p^2 / (4f + 3)\n\nSince we are not given any information about the fertility of the carrier, we cannot calculate the exact value of f. However, we can make an educated estimate based on general knowledge.\n\nFor example, if the fertility of the carrier is average or below average, then we might assume that f = 0.5. In this case, the expected proportion of female carriers would be:\n\nExpected proportion of female carriers = (0.01)^2 / (4(0.5) + 3) = 1 in 4000\n\nThis suggests that the expected incidence of affected homozygous females is 1 in 4000.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
