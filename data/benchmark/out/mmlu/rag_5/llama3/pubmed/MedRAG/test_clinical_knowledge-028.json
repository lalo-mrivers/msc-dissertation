["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about blood lactate concentration in games like soccer. We need to look at the relevant documents for clues. The first document discusses the activity profile of competition soccer and mentions a significant correlation (r = 0.61, p less than 0.05) between the amount of high intensity running during the match and lactate concentration in the blood. This suggests that blood lactate concentration does increase during the game. The second document is about heart rate and blood lactate response in field hockey players, which also mentions a significant correlation (r = 0.61, p less than 0.05) between the amount of high intensity running during the match and lactate concentration in the blood. This further supports the idea that blood lactate concentration does increase during the game. Therefore, we can infer that the answer is D: increases throughout the course of the game as the players become more fatigued.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
