["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking which factor would have increased if the same study had been performed on a population of 500 patients instead of 1000. Since the alpha value (type I error) is already controlled at 0.05, we can focus on the beta value (type II error). A type II error occurs when there is a failure to detect a significant difference between groups due to a small sample size. In this case, if the study had been performed on a population of only 500 patients, the risk of missing a true therapeutic improvement would increase.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
