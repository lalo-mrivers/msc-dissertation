["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe glycogen metabolism in human skeletal muscle during exercise. According to 'Some features of glycogen metabolism in human skeletal muscle', the higher the exercise intensity, the greater the relative proportion of energy output derived from carbohydrate metabolism. This suggests that glycogen breakdown is activated by exercise. Additionally, 'Muscle glycogen and glucose uptake during exercise in humans' reports a significant inverse relationship between muscle glycogen concentration and glucose uptake during exercise, which may imply a regulatory influence of muscle glycogen on glucose uptake. The fate of lactate in skeletal muscle, as discussed in 'Glyconeogenic and oxidative lactate utilization in skeletal muscle', indicates that lactate can be used for glycogen synthesis, especially immediately after exercise when circulating lactate levels are elevated. This suggests that glycogen breakdown is activated by exercise-induced changes in blood lactate levels.\",\n\"answer_choice\": A"]
