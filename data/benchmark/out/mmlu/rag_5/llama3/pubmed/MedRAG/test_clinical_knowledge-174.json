["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the process of translation, which refers to the synthesis of proteins from mRNA. From the provided documents, we can see that translation requires the presence of mRNA and ribosomes. The 5' cap-dependent and internal initiation models both require unwinding of mRNA secondary structures, which suggests the involvement of mRNA. Additionally, the review mentions eukaryotic initiation factors (eIFs), including eIF-4E and eIF-4F, which are necessary for translation. Ribosomes are also mentioned as being involved in protein synthesis. RNA polymerase is not directly mentioned in the context of protein synthesis, but rather in the context of gene transcription. DNA is mentioned as a component of chromatin, which is relevant to gene regulation, but it is not directly involved in the process of translation. Finally, amino acids are the end products of protein synthesis, so they are not required for the process itself. Therefore, based on these considerations, the correct answer is A: mRNA, tRNA and ribosomes.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
