["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents highlight the importance of carbon cycling and its various pools. One key point is that atmospheric CO2 concentration is increasing due to fossil fuel combustion and deforestation. The mechanism of carbon isotope fractionation in metabolic processes shows that there are different pools of carbon with varying isotope compositions. Total anthropogenic CO2 production during 1800-1935 from carbon-13 measurements in tree rings provides an estimate of the total amount of mobilized carbon, which is roughly half produced during the last 25 years. This suggests that human activities have significantly impacted carbon cycling. Finally, microbial catabolism and the carbon cycle highlight the role of oxygenases in degradative processes and the importance of understanding microbial enzymes for environmental concerns.\n\nConsidering these points, it can be inferred that the largest active pool of carbon on Earth is likely the oceans, as they play a crucial role in carbon cycling through various processes such as photosynthesis, respiration, and decomposition. The oceans also have a vast capacity to absorb and store carbon dioxide.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
