["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about changes in Starling forces during a study of renal glomeruli. When the efferent arteriole is constricted with a vascular clamp, there will be an increase in hydrostatic pressure within the glomerular capillaries. This is because the blood flow through the glomerulus will decrease due to constriction of the efferent arteriole, causing an accumulation of fluid and increased hydrostatic pressure.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
