["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about a sarcomere of striated muscle. From the given documents, it can be seen that striated muscles have 2 dissimilar types of filaments: thick filaments composed of myosin and thin filaments composed of actin and tropomyosin. The sliding of these two kinds of filaments past each other in the hexagonal network of the myofibril is responsible for muscular contraction. In the relaxed position, tropomyosin inhibits myosin's access to the binding site of actin. During contraction, Ca2+ ions are released into the myofibril, which leads to the interaction of troponin with the thin filaments and ultimately to muscle contraction.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B\n}"]
