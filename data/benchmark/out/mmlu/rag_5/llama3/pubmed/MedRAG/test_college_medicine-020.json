["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents mention steroid hormone receptors binding to specific DNA sequences, the role of receptor interaction with other nuclear protein factor(s), and receptor dimerization. The study on determinants of high-affinity DNA binding by the glucocorticoid receptor shows that the DNA-binding domain has a 10-fold lower affinity for a palindromic DNA-binding site than the intact receptor. This suggests that steroid hormone receptors are involved in specific binding to DNA sequences.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B: I, II, and III\"\n}"]
