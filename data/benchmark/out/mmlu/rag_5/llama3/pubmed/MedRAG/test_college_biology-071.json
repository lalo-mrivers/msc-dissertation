["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question states that a fluorescent molecule of 1,000 daltons is injected into one cell and observed to enter an adjacent cell. This suggests that the fluorescent molecule is able to pass through a cell junction. The options provided are types of cell junctions: spot desmosome, belt desmosome, gap junction, and tight junction.\n\nFrom the documents provided, we can refer to 'Permeability of a cell junction during intracellular injection of divalent cations' which describes the passage of fluorescein (330 dalton) through cell junctions. The document states that injections of Ca, Mg or Sr produce block or marked slowing of fluorescein passage with little or no detectable electrical uncoupling.\n\nGiven this information, we can infer that a gap junction is the most likely choice as it allows for the direct transfer of ions and small molecules between adjacent cells. This matches the observation of the fluorescent molecule entering an adjacent cell.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
