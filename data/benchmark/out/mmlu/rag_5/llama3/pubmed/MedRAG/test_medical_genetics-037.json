["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the definition of a homeotic mutation. From the provided documents, we can see that homeotic genes regulate expression and function to maintain stable patterns through many cell generations. Recent research has also shown the discovery of new genes with novel expression patterns, and peptide growth factors and retinoic acid influencing homeobox gene expression. Vertebrate homeobox genes are known to function near the top of gene hierarchies controlling vertebrate embryogenesis. Considering these findings, we can deduce that a homeotic mutation is one which substitutes one body part for another in development (option B).\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
