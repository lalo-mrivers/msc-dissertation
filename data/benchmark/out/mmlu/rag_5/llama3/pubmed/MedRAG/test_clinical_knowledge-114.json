["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant passage from the 'Recombination and the evolution of diploidy' document describes an allele that is masked as a recessive deleterious mutation. This type of mutation is present on one copy of every gene in a diploid organism, but its effect is hidden by the presence of a dominant wild-type allele. Since the masking is referred to as 'masking of deleterious alleles', it can be inferred that the masked allele is recessive.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
