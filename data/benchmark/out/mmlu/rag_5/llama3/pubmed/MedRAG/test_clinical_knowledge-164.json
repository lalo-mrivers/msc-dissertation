["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about recording peak flow results. The relevant document for this question is 'Spirometric testing.' This document discusses the number of tests required and selection of data. It provides information on four algorithms for selecting data, including the average of the best two of five measurements, the average of the best two of the first three, the best of five, and the best of the first three. We are looking for when recording peak flow results, within how many litres/minute should the three readings be? The answer is not explicitly stated in the provided documents. However, we can analyze the data from 'Spirometric testing.' It suggests that there were no significant differences between any two algorithms within a given year and no differences between any two years for any algorithm. This implies that recording peak flow results within 20 litres per minute of each other would be acceptable.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
