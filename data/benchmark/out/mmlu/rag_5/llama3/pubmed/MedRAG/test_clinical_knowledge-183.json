["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking how long a cannula can remain in situ. The relevant documents describe various ways to maintain immobile catheters for different periods of time. For example, the first document discusses immobilizing intravenous catheters in monkeys for long-term use without needing deep vessel surgical procedures or maintaining the animal under rigid restraint. Similarly, the third and fourth documents discuss establishing self-retaining permanent catheters in animals for extended periods of time. Based on these examples, it can be inferred that a cannula can remain in situ for more than 24 hours.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C\n}"]
