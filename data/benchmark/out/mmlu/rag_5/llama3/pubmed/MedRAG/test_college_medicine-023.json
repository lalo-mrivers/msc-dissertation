["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking which process uses only the gradient of material to control the direction in which the material moves across the cell membrane. Based on the provided documents, osmosis and passive transport are two processes that rely on concentration gradients to move materials across the cell membrane. Active transport, on the other hand, requires energy input to move molecules against their concentration gradient. Endocytosis is a process of cellular uptake where cells internalize material through the formation of vesicles. It does not solely rely on the gradient of material.\n\nFrom the provided documents, it can be inferred that proteins at the boundary between the cytoskeleton and the plasma membrane control cell shape, delimit specialized membrane domains, and stabilize attachments to other cells and to the substrate. This highlights the importance of the gradient of material in controlling the direction in which materials move across the cell membrane.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B: Passive Transport.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
