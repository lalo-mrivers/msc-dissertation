["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The maxillary sinus is related to several anatomical structures. It is mentioned that diagnosis at an early stage of chronic sinus disease demonstrates that pathological changes are often limited to the osteomeatal complex and the anterior sinus group, which includes the maxillary sinus. The radiologic signs of pneumocele of the maxillary sinus include a cystic air-containing mass occupying the entire maxillary sinus, and lined by the original attenuated mucous membrane. It is also mentioned that surgery in the maxillary sinus with restoration of the surgical defect in the anterior wall was performed using a bone-lid technique. This information suggests that the walls of the maxillary sinus are related to the floor of the orbit, the upper posterior teeth, and possibly other surrounding structures.\", \"answer_choice\": D}"]
