["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks for the expected frequency of affected females given the frequency of males affected with an X-linked recessive condition in a human population. This is a case of estimating sex ratio biases in X-linked disorders, where we can use the formulae provided in [Estimation of the frequency of recessive X-chromosome-associated traits among females]. Specifically, since the condition is autosomal recessive and there are no clinical symptoms, we can assume that the fertility (f) of carriers of the gene is 1. Therefore, the expected proportions under various conditions can be used to estimate the frequency of affected females. According to the formulae, if the frequency of males affected with an X-linked recessive condition in a human population is .10 (one in ten), then the expected frequency of affected females would be half the frequency of affected males, since the gene is autosomal recessive and the carrier frequency is the same for both sexes. Therefore, the expected frequency of affected females would be 0.05.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C: 0.02\""]
