["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the probability that each of their children will be affected if both parents are affected with the same autosomal recessive disorder. Autosomal recessive inheritance means that a person needs to inherit two copies of the mutated gene (one from each parent) to express the disease. Since both parents are affected, they must have inherited one copy of the mutated gene from each other and pass it on to their children. The probability that each child inherits two copies of the mutated gene is 1/4.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
