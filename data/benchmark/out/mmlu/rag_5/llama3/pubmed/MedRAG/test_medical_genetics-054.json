["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about transcriptional activator proteins. The relevant documents describe how eukaryotic activator proteins stimulate the rate of transcription by RNA polymerase II. Specifically, they bind to the regulatory regions of protein-encoding genes and increase the rate at which they are transcribed. This information suggests that transcriptional activator proteins bind regions near a eukaryotic gene and allow an RNA polymerase to transcribe a gene.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
