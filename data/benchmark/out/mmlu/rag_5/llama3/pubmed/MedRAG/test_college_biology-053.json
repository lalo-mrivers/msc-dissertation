["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the given documents, we know that ZP3 is a glycoprotein located in the zona pellucida of mouse eggs. It binds to sperm receptors, initiating the acrosomal reaction. We also know that EC cells transfected with mZP3 genes produce and secrete large amounts of mZP3, which inhibits sperm binding and induces acrosome-reacted in vitro.\n\nOption A: Injecting eggs with antibodies that bind to ZP3 blocks in vitro fertilization. This is consistent with the fact that ovarian-specific antibodies can precipitate the zona pellucida and inhibit sperm binding.\n\nOption B: Incubating sperm with purified ZP3 prior to mixing sperm and eggs blocks in vitro fertilization. This makes sense because binding of ZP3 receptors to ZP3 initiates the acrosomal reaction, and blocking this interaction would prevent fertilization.\n\nOption C: Incubating eggs with antibodies that bind to ZP3 blocks in vitro fertilization. As mentioned earlier, ovarian-specific antibodies can precipitate the zona pellucida and inhibit sperm binding, so it is reasonable to expect that injecting eggs with these antibodies would block in vitro fertilization.\n\nOption D: Coating synthetic beads with a different glycoprotein, ZP2, fails to lead to sperm aggregation on the beads. This option seems irrelevant to the question about ZP3 receptors and ZP3 binding, as it discusses ZP2, which is not directly related to the topic.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
