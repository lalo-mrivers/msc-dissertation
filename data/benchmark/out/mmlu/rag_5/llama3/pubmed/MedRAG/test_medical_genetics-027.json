["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the treatment of a specific disease/syndrome using recombinant alpha-iduronidase. The relevant documents mention Hurler and Scheie syndromes, which are both types of mucopolysaccharidoses. Mucopolysaccharidoses are characterized by defects in enzymes that break down glycosaminoglycans, such as alpha-L-iduronidase. Since recombinant alpha-iduronidase is used for the treatment of a specific disease/syndrome, and Hurler syndrome is mentioned in the documents, it's likely that recombinant alpha-iduronidase is used for the treatment of Hurler syndrome.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
