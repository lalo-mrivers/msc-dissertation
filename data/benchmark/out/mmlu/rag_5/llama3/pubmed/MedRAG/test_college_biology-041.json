["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"This question requires us to consider the densities of the pairs given. According to the provided documents, particles with a density greater than or equal to 10S will band in a gradient corresponding to their density, which can be determined accurately. Therefore, we need to look at the densities of the components in each pair.\\r\\n\\r\\nPair A: DNA and mRNA - Both are nucleic acids, but they have similar densities, so it is unlikely that they could be separated by low-speed centrifugation.\\r\\n\\r\\nPair B: Nuclei and secretory vesicles - Nuclei have a higher density than secretory vesicles. Since the nuclei would band in the gradient corresponding to their density, low-speed centrifugation should be able to separate them.\\r\\n\\r\\nPair C: Golgi apparatus and endoplasmic reticulum - Both are membranous structures with similar densities, making it unlikely that they could be separated by low-speed centrifugation.\\r\\n\\r\\nPair D: Lysosomes and endosomes - Similarly, these membrane-bound organelles have similar densities, so it is not likely that they could be separated by low-speed centrifugation.\\r\\n\\r\\nTherefore, the correct answer is B: Nuclei and secretory vesicles.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
