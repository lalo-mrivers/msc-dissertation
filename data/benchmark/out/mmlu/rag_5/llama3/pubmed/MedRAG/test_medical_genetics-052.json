["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about positional cloning. We can look at the provided documents to understand what this process involves. From 'Genome mapping: cDNA approaches', we see that clones of cDNAs have several practical advantages as start points for making physical maps of genomes. This suggests that positional cloning may involve using these clones to identify a gene's location on the genome. In 'The mouse genome: an overview', we are told that a map with one molecularly marked locus per cM will be available for the mouse in the near future, which could provide molecular reference points that connect genetic and physical maps. This further supports the idea that positional cloning involves mapping a gene to a chromosomal region and then identifying and cloning a genomic copy of the gene from that region.\n\nIn 'The molecular and genetic analysis of mouse development', we learn about the establishment of a high-density molecular-genetic map, which promises to facilitate cloning of additional genes with developmental functions. This also suggests that positional cloning involves mapping a gene's location on the genome before identifying and cloning it.\n\nGiven these points, it seems clear that positional cloning refers to isolating a gene by mapping its location on the genome and then identifying and cloning a genomic copy of the gene from that region.\n\nTherefore, our answer choice is\",\n\"answer_choice\": D\n}"]
