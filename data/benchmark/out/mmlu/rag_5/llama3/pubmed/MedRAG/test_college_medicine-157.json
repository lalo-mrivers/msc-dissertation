["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for an example of the transmission of knowledge through symbolic culture. The options provided are scenarios involving animals (macaques), humans (children learning baseball from a parent), and a military organization. I'll analyze each option to determine which one is an exception.\\nIn scenario I, a young macaque monkey learns by observing an older monkey. This is an example of social learning through observation, not symbolic culture.\\nScenario II involves a child learning the rules of baseball from a parent. This is also an example of social learning, as the child is learning through verbal or non-verbal communication from their parent. The rules of baseball are abstract and not necessarily tied to specific actions like food rinsing in scenario I.\\nScenario III describes hazing rituals passed down from older students to new recruits. While this is an example of cultural transmission, it's not specifically about the transmission of knowledge through symbolic culture. Hazing rituals can be seen as a form of social learning or cultural transmission, but they don't necessarily involve abstract rules like those in baseball.\\nTherefore, I'll look for the exception among the options.\\nOption A, scenario I, is the clear exception. The other two scenarios involve human culture and language, which are essential components of symbolic culture.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
