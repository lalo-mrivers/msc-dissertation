["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Introns are non-coding regions of DNA that are found interspersed with exons on a region of DNA that codes for a polypeptide chain. They are excised from the primary transcript before it gains a 5' cap and a 3' poly(A)tail. The provided documents do not discuss magnetic resonance, suicide notes, death, or dying, as these topics are unrelated to introns. The bibliography on semantic memory is also irrelevant. Therefore, we can conclude that option A (They occur only in eukaryotes), B (They represent noncoding regions), and C (They are found interspersed with exons on a region of DNA that codes for a polypeptide chain) are all characteristics of introns. The correct answer is D.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
