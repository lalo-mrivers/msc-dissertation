["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about mapping human chromosomes. The documents provided describe the construction of genetic linkage maps for specific human chromosomes (X, 3, and 10). The process involves identifying polymorphic DNA markers, genotyping them in reference families, and determining their order along the chromosome. This allows for the creation of a map that can be used to locate genes and study genetic diseases. Given this information, it seems unlikely that the mapping of human chromosomes would be restricted to the sex chromosomes due to small family sizes (A). The development of large numbers of DNA markers has likely played a significant role in the successful mapping of human chromosomes (B), but this is not the only factor. The number of linkage groups is expected to be equal to the number of chromosomes, as each chromosome forms one linkage group. Therefore, option C is correct. Finally, while it is true that most DNA is involved in coding for genes, this does not directly impact our understanding of how human chromosomes are mapped.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
