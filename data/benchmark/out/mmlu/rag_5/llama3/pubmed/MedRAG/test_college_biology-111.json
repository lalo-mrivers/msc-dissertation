["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which option must be true for evolution to have occurred, we can analyze the provided documents. The first document discusses the evolution of life on Earth, suggesting that available compounds dictate the type of organisms to emerge. This implies that changes in the frequencies of alleles in a population's gene pool over successive generations (Option A) are likely necessary for evolution to occur. Additionally, the second document describes the process of explosive evolution and adaptation, which also supports the idea that changes in allele frequencies over time are required. The other options do not seem directly relevant to the concept of evolution.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
