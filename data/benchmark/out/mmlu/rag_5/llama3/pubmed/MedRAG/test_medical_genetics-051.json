["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks how many fragments a restriction enzyme would be expected to cleave a double-stranded bacteriophage with a genome size of 5,000 bp into. The relevant information is the recognition sequence of the restriction enzyme (4 base sequence) and the genome size.\n\nFrom the provided documents, we can see that some restriction enzymes recognize specific sequences in DNA. For example, endonuclease II-dependent cleavage sites in bacteriophage T4 DNA share the sequence 5'-CCGNNTTGGC-3'. This suggests that a restriction enzyme recognizing a specific 4 base sequence would likely cleave at these specific locations.\n\nThe genome size of 5,000 bp is also relevant. We can assume that the recognition sequence appears multiple times in the phage DNA. The number of fragments expected is therefore the number of times the recognition sequence appears in the genome divided by the length of the recognition sequence (4 base pairs).\n\nIn this case, we have a genome size of 5,000 bp and a recognition sequence of 4 base pairs. We can divide the genome size by the recognition sequence to get approximately 1,250 fragments.\", \"answer_choice\": B}"]
