["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the mechanism by which H+ returns to the inside of the mitochondria. From the provided documents, we know that ATP synthase is a specialized channel involved in oxidative phosphorylation. The document 'Kinetic studies of ATP synthase' explains that energy from the proton gradient is exerted not directly for the reaction at the catalytic site, but rather to release product from a single catalytic site through a positional change. This suggests that the mechanism involves the movement or rotation of proteins in ATP synthase.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C: Active transport\""]
