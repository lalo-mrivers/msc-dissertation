["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for the complementary DNA strand sequence. The given DNA strand has the sequence 5' CGA TTG 3'. To find the complement, we need to replace each base with its complement: C becomes G, G becomes C, A becomes T, and T becomes A. Applying this rule, we get: 5' GCT AGA 3'\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
