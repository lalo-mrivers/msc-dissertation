["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the documents provided, we can infer that transcription of DNA to a molecule of messenger RNA occurs in the nucleus. This is supported by the fact that 'accurate initiation of eukaryotic mRNA synthesis takes place as a result of the interplay between general transcription factors and RNA polymerase II' (DNA intervention in transcriptional activation). Additionally, 'transcription of an immunoglobulin switch region... leads to a loss of superhelical turns' which suggests that transcription is occurring within the nucleus. Therefore, it can be concluded that transcription occurs in the nucleus.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
