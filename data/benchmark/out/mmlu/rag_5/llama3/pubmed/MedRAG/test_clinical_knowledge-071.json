["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The study 'A study of chest compression rates during cardiopulmonary resuscitation in humans' suggests that higher compression rates can improve end-tidal carbon dioxide levels. In this study, a rate-directed chest compression at 120 compressions per minute showed a mean end-tidal carbon dioxide level of 15.0 +/- 1.8 mm Hg, which is slightly but significantly higher than the mean level of 13.0 +/- 1.8 mm Hg at a compression rate of 80 per minute.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
