["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the measurement of creatine kinase isoenzyme catalytic concentrations in serum using immunological methods. One method uses inhibiting antibodies to block the activity of creatine kinase M subunits (Inhibition Test). The other method uses precipitating antibodies to differentiate between MM, MB and BB isoenzymes (Precipitation Test). No information suggests that intracellular ADP levels, muscle pH or fibre types affect the activity of creatine kinase. After a period of endurance training, exercise can lead to increased serum CPK activity.\",\n\"answer_choice\": A"]
