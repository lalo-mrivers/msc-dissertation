["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The key to this problem is understanding the genetics of the garden peas. The allele for tall plants (D) is completely dominant to the allele for dwarf plants (d), which means that a plant with one copy of the dominant allele (Dd) will be tall, not dwarf. Similarly, the allele for violet flower color (W) is completely dominant to the allele for white flower color (w). This means that a plant with one copy of the dominant allele (Ww) will have violet flowers, not white. Therefore, we can expect all the progeny to be tall and violet.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
