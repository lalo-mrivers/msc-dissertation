["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about a feature of X-linked dominant inheritance. We can look at the given documents for clues. In the document 'Molecular detection of altered X-inactivation patterns...', it mentions that some special cases of non-random X-inactivation patterns include females carrying X-linked immunodeficiencies and, sometimes, one of a pair of identical female twins. This suggests that X-linked dominant inheritance is characterized by non-random X-inactivation patterns in females. Furthermore, the document 'Females with a disorder phenotypically identical to X-linked agammaglobulinemia...' discusses an autosomal recessive disorder that is phenotypically identical to X-linked agammaglobulinemia. This suggests that autosomal dominant inheritance can also be characterized by non-random X-inactivation patterns in females. Therefore, we can conclude that a feature of X-linked dominant inheritance is the presence of non-random X-inactivation patterns in females.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
