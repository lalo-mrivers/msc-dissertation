["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 47-year-old woman with persistent nonproductive cough for 6 weeks. She has no fever or weight loss, and does not smoke. The patient's hypertension is treated with enalapril for the past 3 months. The chest X-ray shows no abnormalities. Given this information, we can focus on the medication she is taking as a potential cause of her cough.
