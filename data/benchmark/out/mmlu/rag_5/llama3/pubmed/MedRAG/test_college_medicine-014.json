["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's behavior suggests that they are experiencing hypokinetic-rigid symptoms, which are positively correlated with neuroleptic-induced increases in central dopamine (DA) turnover. This is supported by the study on 'Importance of dopamine metabolism for clinical effects and side effects of neuroleptics'. The patient's agitation and aggressive behavior also suggest a possible overactive DA system, as increased DA has been linked to aggression. Additionally, the review on 'Aminergic brain system interactions and psychopathology' highlights that single-amine theories are inadequate and that different amine systems interact with each other. Considering this, it is likely that the patient's dopamine system is overactive rather than decreased.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
