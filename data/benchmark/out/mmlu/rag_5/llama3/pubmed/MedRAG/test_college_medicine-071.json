["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"After reviewing the provided documents, we can see that there is no direct answer to this question. However, we can infer that endurance exercise training affects the time course of the increase in VO2 toward steady state in response to submaximal constant load work. We also know that aerobic power induced by a strenuous program of endurance exercise increases linearly during the 10 weeks of training. Additionally, day-to-day changes in oxygen uptake kinetics at the onset of exercise during strenuous endurance training suggest that there is an adaptation to the training stimulus. Cardiorespiratory adaptation with short-term training in older men also shows significant and rapid cardiorespiratory improvements.\n\nConsidering these findings, we can assume that maximal dynamic exercise becomes predominantly aerobic after a certain period of time, likely related to the duration and intensity of the exercise. However, without further information, it is difficult to pinpoint an exact time point.\", \n\"answer_choice\": C"]
