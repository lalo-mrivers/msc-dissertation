["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Boyle's Law states that at constant temperature, the volume of a gas is inversely proportional to its pressure. Therefore, we can set up the equation: P1V1 = P2V2, where P1 and V1 are the initial pressure (200atm) and volume (0.1L), and P2 and V2 are the final pressure (1atm) and unknown volume.\n\nPlugging in the values, we get: 200 * 0.1 = 1 * V2.\n\nSolving for V2, we get: V2 = 20L.\n\nSince the question asks about the gas's volume at 1atm, the answer is the final volume of 20L.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
