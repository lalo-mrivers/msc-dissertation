["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is experiencing an increase in asthma symptoms over the past month, with daily use of his albuterol inhaler for wheezing and chest tightness. He has no other significant medical history or symptoms. Given that he has had cold and exercise-induced asthma for 14 years, it's likely that this is a case of exacerbating chronic asthma rather than an acute asthma attack. The peak expiratory flow rate of 240 L/min suggests that the patient does not have severe airway obstruction.\n\nConsidering the patient's history and physical examination, initiation of daily corticosteroid inhaler therapy may be indicated to help control his symptoms. This is supported by the documents 'Maintaining pharmacological control of asthma' and 'Asthma: pathophysiology and clinical correlates', which suggest that careful analysis of presenting signs and symptoms can permit clinically useful conclusions regarding magnitude and severity of airway obstruction, and expected response to therapy.\n\nIn addition, initiation of a daily corticosteroid inhaler may help reduce the need for frequent use of albuterol inhaler, as suggested in 'Patterns of response to isoprenaline in asthmatic patients'. This approach also aligns with the principle that agreed systems of management (protocols) between client and practitioner can help clients gain control over their condition, as mentioned in 'Greater understanding enhances control. Maintaining pharmacological control of asthma'.\n\nIn contrast, increasing use of albuterol inhaler or initiating fexofenadine therapy are not directly addressed by the patient's symptoms and physical examination, and may not address the underlying issue of exacerbating chronic asthma. Chest x-ray is also not indicated in this case, as there is no suggestion of acute respiratory failure or other life-threatening complications.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
