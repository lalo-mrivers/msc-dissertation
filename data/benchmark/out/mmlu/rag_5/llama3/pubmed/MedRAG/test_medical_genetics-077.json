["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about female pseudohermaphroditism. Male pseudohermaphroditism is a condition characterized by the presence of testes but inadequate virilization. The given documents discuss different causes of male pseudohermaphroditism, including androgen insensitivity, partial end-organ insensitivity to androgens, and mixed gonadal dysgenesis. There is no mention of female pseudohermaphroditism in these documents. Therefore, we need to look for information outside the provided documents. Female pseudohermaphroditism can be caused by congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH), which leads to excessive production of androgens, causing virilization in genetically female individuals. The other options, Campomelic dysplasia and Klinefelter syndrome, are not related to female pseudohermaphroditism.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
