["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the growth of the mandible. I need to find relevant information from the provided documents. The first document talks about longitudinal growth of the mandible from 5 to 20 years old, but it doesn't provide specific information about condylar growth cartilage or ossification centre. The second document mentions the role of the mandibular condyle in influencing mandibular growth and that the total mandibular length was reduced with deficient corpus length and ramus height. This suggests that the condylar growth cartilage might be involved in the growth process. The third document talks about a modified sagittal osteotomy for elongation and rotation of the mandible, but it doesn't provide information about the ossification centre or condylar growth cartilage. The fourth document provides treatment results for surgical-orthodontic correction of mandibular deficiency in growing children. It mentions that the direction of growth varies with an increasing mandibular plane angle. Based on this information, I think the answer should be related to the development of the mandible and its growth pattern.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
