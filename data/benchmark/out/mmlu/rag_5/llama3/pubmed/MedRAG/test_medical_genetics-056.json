["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the provided documents, it can be inferred that recombination occurs during Prophase I. This is supported by the fact that DMC1 gene is meiosis-specific and required for recombination, synaptonemal complex formation, and cell cycle progression. Additionally, the document 'DMC1: a meiosis-specific yeast homolog of E. coli recA required for recombination, synaptonemal complex formation, and cell cycle progression' states that dmc1 mutants are defective in reciprocal recombination, accumulate double-strand break (DSB) recombination intermediates, fail to form normal synaptonemal complex (SC), and arrest late in meiotic prophase.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
