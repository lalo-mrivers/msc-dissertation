["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, we need to find a study that provides the relationship between oxygen consumption and energy expenditure. After reviewing the provided documents, we found that the study 'Energy cost of circuit weight training' provides this information. According to this study, the average gross energy expenditure was 539.7 kcal/hr for men. Since the mean rate of oxygen consumption is given as 2 l/min, which is equivalent to 120 ml/kg/min (1 liter = 1000 ml), we can use the following conversion factor: 1 liter O2 = 5 kcal. Therefore, the energy expenditure in kJ/min can be calculated as follows: 120 ml/kg/min x 5 kcal/liter x conversion factor for kJ to kcal (1 kJ = 0.239 kcal) = approximately 80 kJ/min.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
