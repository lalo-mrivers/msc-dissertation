["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for the rate of energy expenditure given the mean rate of oxygen consumption. We know that VO2max increased from 3.29 liters to 4.53 liters after training. For this problem, we are only concerned with the rate of oxygen consumption during a training session, which is 2 l/min. Using the documents provided, we can find the relationship between VO2 and energy expenditure. In the 'Energy cost of circuit weight training' document, it was found that gross energy expenditure was highly related to body weight (r = 0.84). Therefore, we can use this information to estimate the rate of energy expenditure.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A: 400 kJ/min.\""]
