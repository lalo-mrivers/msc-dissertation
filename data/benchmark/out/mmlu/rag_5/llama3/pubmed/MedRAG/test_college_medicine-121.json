["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the function of neurons. Neurons are discussed separately from glial cells in the provided documents. The document 'Actions of identified neuromodulatory neurons in a simple motor system' provides information on the functions of neurons, specifically neuromodulatory neurons. It discusses how these cells can affect the cellular and synaptic properties of central pattern generating circuits, orchestrating new variations of motor patterns. This suggests that neurons have the ability to modulate their own function as well as the function of other neurons. The documents do not provide information on the flow of sodium into the neuron or the transmitting neuron secreting neurotransmitters from its dendrites. Therefore, options B and C are true regarding the function of neurons.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
