["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about emergency opening into the airway. The relevant documents discuss cricothyrotomy, an emergency procedure to establish an airway when the usual routes are blocked. In the document 'Retrograde intubation of the pharynx: an unusual complication of emergency cricothyrotomy', it discusses methods for avoiding complications during this procedure. The document 'A clinical evaluation of cricothyroidotomy' explains that cricothyroidotomy was performed upon 147 patients, and the incidence of complications was 8.6 per cent. Catastrophic complications occurred in two patients who had severe laryngeal stenosis. Cricothyroidotomy was performed following prolonged endotracheal intubation in these two patients who had airway obstruction immediately following endotracheal extubation. In both patients, there was a glottic and subglottic component to the laryngeal stenosis suggesting that endotracheal intubation as well cricothyroidotomy played a critical part in the development of laryngeal stenosis. In view of these observations, we believe that cricothyroidotomy is useful, particularly in emergency situations and in patients with median sternotomy incisions but is contraindicated in patients having endotracheal intubation of more than seven days' duration or in patients having airway obstruction develop following removal of an endotracheal tube except as a temporary lifesaving procedure. The other documents 'Emergency tracheostomy' and 'A new instrument for uncomplicated emergency cricothyrotomy' provide additional information about emergency procedures. In the document 'Emergency cricothyrotomy', it discusses the indications for this procedure. Therefore, it is necessary to read these documents in order to understand how an emergency opening into the airway should be performed.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
