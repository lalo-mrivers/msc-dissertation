["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the regulation of protein synthesis at the elongation stage, including phosphorylation of eEF-2 by Ca(2+)-dependent eEF-2 kinase. They also discuss posttranslational covalent modification of proteins, including the addition of amino acids via peptide bonds. This suggests that B: Attachment of more amino acids via peptide bonds is not a process used to modify protein structure after translation has occurred.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
