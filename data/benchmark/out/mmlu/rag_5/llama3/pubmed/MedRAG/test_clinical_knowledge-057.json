["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The cardiac cycle is described as having different phases that are related to the work load. The article 'Cardiac dynamics during the work load as studied by polycardiography' mentions changes in systolic time intervals, exponential decay of parameters showing sinusoidal oscillations and the number of oscillations being greatest in the ejection period. This suggests that the cardiac cycle is a dynamic process with different phases. In the article 'Cardiac cycle phase and movement and reaction times', the EKG record was analyzed by dividing each R-R interval encompassing a stimulus presentation into 9 equal phases. This further supports the idea that the cardiac cycle has multiple phases.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
