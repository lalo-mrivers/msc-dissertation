["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents provided discuss DNA diagnosis for inherited metabolic disorders, including carrier detection. Sandhoff disease is mentioned as a disorder where carrier detection requires measurement of both total and heat-stable enzyme activity. Haemophilia A and Hurler's syndrome are also discussed, with methods for detecting the carrier state by assaying specific enzymes. This information suggests that enzyme assay can be used to identify carriers of inherited metabolic disorders. Tay-Sachs disease is specifically mentioned in one of the documents as a disorder where patients can be screened for characterized mutations.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
