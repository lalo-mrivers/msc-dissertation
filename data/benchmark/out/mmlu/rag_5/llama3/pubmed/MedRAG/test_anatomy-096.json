["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the pathway of parasympathetic preganglionic nerves leaving the central nervous system. We can look at relevant documents to find information on this topic. The document 'Neuronal specificity and plasticity in the autonomic nervous system' mentions that the autonomic nervous system supplies each type of target organ via separate pathways which consist of sets of pre- and postganglionic neurones with distinct patterns of reflex activity. This suggests that parasympathetic preganglionic nerves are part of this pathway. The document 'Extrinsic neural influences on gastrointestinal motility' also mentions that all levels of the central nervous system have been shown, by stimulation and ablation studies, to influence the motility of the entire gastrointestinal tract. This includes the vagus nerve which is a parasympathetic pathway. Therefore, we can conclude that parasympathetic preganglionic nerves leave the central nervous system via the vagus nerve.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
