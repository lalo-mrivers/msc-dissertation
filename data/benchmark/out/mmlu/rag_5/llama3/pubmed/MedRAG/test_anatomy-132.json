["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about loss of somatic sensation over the anterior two-thirds of the tongue. The relevant documents discuss various nerves that supply motor or sensory function to the tongue. Idiopathic trigeminal sensory neuropathy involves transient sensory disturbances in the territory of one or more branches of the trigeminal nerve, but it does not specifically mention the anterior two-thirds of the tongue. Bilateral injury to the hypoglossal nerve affects motor function of the tongue, but it does not cause loss of somatic sensation. Post-traumatic ischemic necrosis of the tongue and burning tongue are unrelated to the question. Repair of anterior floor of mouth defects uses an island pedicle tongue flap without affecting swallowing or speech, suggesting that the nerves involved are primarily motor. Considering these points, we focus on the trigeminal nerve branches mentioned in the documents.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
