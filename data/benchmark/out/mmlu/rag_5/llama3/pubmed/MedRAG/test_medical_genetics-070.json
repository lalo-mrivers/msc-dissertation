["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The provided documents discuss various aspects of male breast cancer, including its genetic contribution. One report highlights the presence of a germline mutation in the androgen receptor gene in two brothers with breast cancer and Reifenstein syndrome. This suggests that mutations in genes related to androgen receptors or hormone regulation might be involved in male breast cancer. Another document discusses p53 mutations occurring in aggressive breast cancer, but it does not explicitly link these findings to male breast cancer. Therefore, we focus on the genetic considerations for male breast cancer.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A/B\""]
