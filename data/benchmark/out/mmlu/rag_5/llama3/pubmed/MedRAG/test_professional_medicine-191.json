["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the sympathetic innervation for the viscera involved in this patient's condition. The patient has a 6-month history of intermittent loose stools alternating with constipation, which suggests that the problem is related to the gut. The symptoms are not severe enough to suggest a serious underlying condition such as inflammatory bowel disease or malabsorption syndrome, so we can focus on more common causes of gastrointestinal symptoms. The fact that the patient's symptoms seem to be related to final exam week and have an alternating pattern of loose stools and constipation suggests that this may be a functional disorder, possibly related to stress or anxiety.\n\nThe sympathetic innervation for the viscera involved in this patient's condition originates from the thoracic spine (T1-T4). The sympathetic nervous system has both parasympathetic and sympathic components, but the question is specifically asking about the sympathic component.\n\nWe can rule out C1-C2 as it only supplies the head and neck. L3-L5 supply the lower limbs and not the viscera involved in this patient's condition.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
