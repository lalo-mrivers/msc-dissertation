["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the blood glucose concentration during exercise. From the provided documents, we can see that in 'Serum insulin and glucose response to graded exercise in adults. Part I: The influence of fitness status', it states that the sedentary group demonstrated little or no change in serum GC during exercise, whereas significant increases in serum GC were observed during exercise in the active group. This suggests that blood glucose concentration may rise during exercise, especially in active individuals. Additionally, in 'Carbohydrate feeding during exercise', it is mentioned that maintaining blood glucose concentration and the rate of carbohydrate oxidation necessary to exercise strenuously requires exogenous glucose supplementation at rates in excess of 1 gram/min. This also implies that blood glucose concentration can increase during prolonged exercise.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
