["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The two noradrenergic systems mentioned are the dorsal bundle and the ventral bundle. The documents suggest that the dorsal bundle inhibits serotonergic neurons while tonically stimulating dopaminergic neurons. On the other hand, the ventral noradrenergine bundle seems to exert opposite influences. This information is not directly related to the question of which two structures noradrenaline is between. Instead, we can look at the documents that discuss the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems. We see that noradrenaline is released by sympathetic neurons and affects various target organs. Therefore, we are looking for an answer choice that involves sympathetic neurons or target organs.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
