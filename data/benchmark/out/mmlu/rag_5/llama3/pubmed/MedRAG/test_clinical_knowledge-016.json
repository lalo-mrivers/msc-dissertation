["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about a thyroid swelling. We can rule out option A because the document 'Risk of neoplasia and malignancy in \"dominant\" thyroid swellings' states that 179 consecutive patients presenting with a discrete thyroid swelling, but it does not mention anything about swallowing. Therefore, we cannot conclude that all thyroid swellings elevate on swallowing.\n\nWe can also rule out option B because the same document states that 'Dominant thyroid swellings should be regarded with greater clinical suspicion than has been traditional.' This suggests that lymph node enlargement is not a good prognostic sign in this case.\n\nAs for option C, the document 'The role of ultrasound scanning in the diagnosis of thyroid swellings' states that ultrasound can determine if a thyroid is normal or abnormal, but it does not specifically mention whether an ultrasound of a swelling can determine whether the nodule is actively secreting hormone. Therefore, we cannot conclude that this is the best test to do so.\n\nFinally, option D seems plausible based on the document 'Risk of neoplasia and malignancy in \"dominant\" thyroid swellings', which states that some excised dominant swellings were found to be neoplastic or even malignant. Therefore, a functioning nodule on isotope scanning could potentially be due to cancer.\n\nBased on our step-by-step thinking, the correct answer is D.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
