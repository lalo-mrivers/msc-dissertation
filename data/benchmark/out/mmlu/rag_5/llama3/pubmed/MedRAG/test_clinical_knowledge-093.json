["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Since the question is asking for a true statement that is not correct, I will analyze each option to determine which one does not accurately represent medical knowledge. Option A states that muscle glycogen is broken down enzymatically to glucose-1-phosphate. This is a true statement as muscle glycogenolysis involves the breakdown of glycogen into glucose-1-phosphate through an enzyme-mediated process. Option B states that elite endurance runners have a high proportion of Type I fibers in their leg muscles, which is also true. Type I fibers are slow-twitch fibers that are well-suited for endurance activities and are typically found in higher proportions in the muscles of athletes who engage in these types of activities. Option C states that liver glycogen is important in the maintenance of the blood glucose concentration. This is also true as liver glycogen plays a crucial role in regulating blood glucose levels, particularly during periods of fasting or when glucose demands increase. Option D states that insulin promotes glucose uptake by all tissues in the body. While insulin does play a key role in regulating glucose metabolism and promoting glucose uptake into muscles and other tissues, it is not accurate to say that insulin promotes glucose uptake by all tissues equally. Instead, insulin's effects on glucose uptake vary depending on the specific tissue or organ involved.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
