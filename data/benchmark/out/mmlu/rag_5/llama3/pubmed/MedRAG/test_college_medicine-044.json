["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the ratio of A:T bases in the newly synthesized complementary strand of DNA. Since DNA polymerase adds complimentary nucleotides to a template strand, the ratio of A:T bases in the new strand will be the same as the ratio of T:A bases in the original double-stranded DNA. The given ratio of 3:2 for A:T bases in the original double-stranded DNA means that there are three times more A's than T's. Therefore, the ratio of T:A in the original double-stranded DNA is 1:3. When adding complimentary nucleotides to this template strand, the ratio of T:A becomes reversed, resulting in a ratio of A:T equal to 3:2.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
