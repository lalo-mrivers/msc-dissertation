["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks how marine birds maintain their tissue osmolarity. We can start by analyzing the provided documents. In 'Dehydration elevates osmotic threshold for salt gland secretion in the duck', we see that ducks maintain their internal osmolarity at a constant level despite drinking seawater. This suggests that the birds may have a mechanism to regulate their internal osmolarity. In 'The control of adaptive hypertrophy in the salt glands of geese and ducks', we learn that the salt glands are sensitive to more than just extracellular fluid tonicity, and that elevation of the osmotic threshold may occur in response to decreased ECF volume. This points towards a mechanism involving changes in body fluid osmolality.\n\nIn 'Carbon dioxide in water- and air-breathers', we see that aquatic animals breathe much more water than air-breathers breathe air, which could affect their internal osmolarity. However, this does not directly relate to the question of how marine birds maintain their tissue osmolarity.\n\nFinally, in 'Studies on the avian shell gland during egg formation: aqueous and electrolytic composition of the mucosa', we learn about the physiological mechanisms involved in shell formation, but these do not seem directly relevant to the question either.\n\nConsidering all this information, it seems that marine birds absorb salts from the environment through specialized salt-exchange glands (option B) and produce large volumes of concentrated urine in the kidneys. This would allow them to maintain their internal osmolarity at a constant level.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
