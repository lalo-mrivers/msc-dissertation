["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 14-year-old boy who has developed breasts during the past year. The physical examination shows bilateral 1.5-cm fibroglandular masses beneath the nipple-areolar complex and normal penis and testes. Pubic hair development is Tanner stage 3, indicating normal pubertal development. Serum concentrations of gonadotropic hormones, estrogens, and testosterone are within the reference ranges.\n\nGiven these findings, it is unlikely that the patient has an estradiol-secreting Leydig cell tumor or Peutz-Jeghers syndrome, as these would typically be accompanied by abnormal hormone levels or other systemic symptoms. Seminiferous tubule dysgenesis (Klinefelter syndrome) could potentially cause gynecomastia, but it is characterized by hypogonadism and infertility, which is not consistent with the patient's normal pubic hair development and testosterone levels.\n\nTherefore, the most likely cause of this patient's breast enlargement is pubertal gynecomastia. This is a common phenomenon in adolescent boys, as noted in the relevant documents.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: Normal development\""]
