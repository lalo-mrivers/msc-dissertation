["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the duration of maximal exertion exercise sustained by the energy released from the breakdown of high-energy phosphates ATP and phosphocreatine. We can look at the relevant documents for clues. In 'Metabolic factors in fatigue', we see that near-maximal power output can be attained during acidotic conditions, which suggests that the energy deficit is the primary cause of fatigue. Additionally, we know from 'Resynthesis of creatine phosphate' that the resynthesis of CP only occurs when the blood supply to the muscle is intact. This implies that the breakdown of high-energy phosphates ATP and phosphocreatine is not sustainable for an extended period.\n\nLooking at 'The effect of circulatory occlusion on isometric exercise capacity', we see that 1% decrease in ATP content and 32% decrease in CP content occurs after 20 min of occlusion. This suggests that the energy released from the breakdown of high-energy phosphates can sustain maximal exertion for a relatively short period.\n\nFinally, 'Regulation of muscle carbohydrate metabolism during exercise' provides some insight into the regulation of glycolysis, but it doesn't directly address the question.\n\nConsidering all these points, it's likely that the energy released from the breakdown of high-energy phosphates ATP and phosphocreatine can sustain maximal exertion for a relatively short period, around 1-2 seconds.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
