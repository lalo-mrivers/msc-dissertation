["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The concept of power in muscular performance is defined as the rate at which muscles can contract and sustain a force throughout the range of motion. In the context of the given documents, we are looking for information about the maximum sustainable power. The document 'The power struggle: definition and evaluation of power of muscular performance' explains that power can be measured using an isokinetic dynamometer, controlling the velocity of motion. However, it does not provide direct information about the maximum sustainable power.\n\nFrom another perspective, we can analyze the documents to find some clues about the relationship between power and factors such as distance or muscle glycogen content. The document 'A sinusoidal load generator for use in cycle ergometry' discusses modifying a cycle ergometer to generate a sinusoidally varying work load, which is related to power. However, it does not provide information directly relevant to the maximum sustainable power.\n\nThe documents 'Atmospheric CO2 consequences of heavy dependence on coal', 'Planning and administrative perspectives on adequate minimum personal health services', and 'Understanding the persistence of human resource problems in health' seem unrelated to the concept of power in muscular performance. Therefore, we can focus on the remaining information provided by the document 'The power struggle: definition and evaluation of power of muscular performance'.\n\nFrom this document, we can infer that peak power is a term used to describe motor performance, which might be related to the maximum sustainable power. Peak power refers to the highest level of power achieved during a specific task or exercise.\n\nConsidering these findings, it seems reasonable to assume that the maximum sustainable power is related to peak power. However, without direct information, we cannot make a definitive statement about its relationship with muscle glycogen content or distance.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
