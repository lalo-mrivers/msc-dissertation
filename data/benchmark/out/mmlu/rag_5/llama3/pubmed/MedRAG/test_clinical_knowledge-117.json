["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the provided documents, we can see that when the rate of glycolysis is high, the pH of the solution may be affected. To limit these pH changes, an intracellular buffer would be needed to maintain a stable pH. The document 'pH, temperature and lactate production in human red blood cells: implications for blood storage and glycolytic control' explains that the ionizable groups involved in enzyme catalysis are sensitive to temperature and pH changes. Therefore, a buffer that can bind to these ionizable groups would be effective in limiting pH changes. Carnosine is such an intracellular buffer that has been shown to have this effect.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
