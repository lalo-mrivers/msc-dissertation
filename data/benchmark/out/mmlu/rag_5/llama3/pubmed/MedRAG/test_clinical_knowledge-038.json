["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about what is embedded in the inner membrane of the mitochondrion. We have to go through the provided documents to find the answer. From 'Functions of the mitochondrial membrane', we can see that oxidative phosphorylation and metabolic functions are integrated in the inner mitochondrial membrane, which means that some enzymes or components must be present there. Then, from 'Energy-dependent processing of cytoplasmically made precursors to mitochondrial proteins', we learn that some polypeptides are processed inside the mitochondrial matrix, which suggests that some enzymes might be embedded in the inner membrane for this purpose.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
