["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the tissues and tissue regions that a stem-boring beetle larva would encounter as it eats its way out of the wood twig. Since the epidermis has already fallen off completely, we can focus on the internal structure of the twig. The pith is the innermost region of the twig, which is also the starting point for the larvae. As they move outward, they will first encounter primary xylem, then secondary xylem, and eventually vascular cambium. Next, they will reach primary phloem, followed by secondary phloem, and finally, the cortex.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
