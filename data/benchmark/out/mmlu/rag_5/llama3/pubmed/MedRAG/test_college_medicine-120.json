["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, we can look at the Activity profile of competition soccer document. It states that there was a significant correlation (r = 0.61, p less than 0.05) between the amount of high intensity running during the match and lactate concentration in the blood. This suggests that blood lactate levels do increase as players become more fatigued throughout the course of the game.\n\nNext, we can look at the Comparison of various exercise tests with endurance performance during soccer document. It states that there was a correlation between VO2max (r = 0.64) and blood lactate concentrations during submaximal running (r = 0.58) and match-distance. This suggests that as players become more fatigued, their blood lactate levels increase.\n\nFinally, we can look at the other documents, such as Heart rate &amp; blood lactate response in field hockey players. It states that blood lactate levels after warm up, training and the game were 2.1, 7.4 and 4.2 mM/l, respectively for the juniors and 2.6, 7.7 and 5.6 mM/l, for the seniors. This suggests that as players become more fatigued, their blood lactate levels increase.\n\nBased on these findings, it appears that blood lactate concentration does increase throughout the course of the game as players become more fatigued.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
