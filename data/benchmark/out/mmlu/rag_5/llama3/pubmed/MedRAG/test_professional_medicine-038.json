["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about maintaining serum glucose concentration after a meal. The key point is that the man sleeps through the night without additional food or drink. This means that we need to consider mechanisms that occur during fasting periods. From the provided documents, we know that in normal individuals, glucagon does not play a significant role in glucose tolerance (document 1). We also know that ethanol can enhance glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and improve blood glucose response to ingested carbohydrate (document 2). Additionally, we have information about the metabolic environment during fasting periods, where forces promoting substrate mobilization are prominent. Based on this information, it is unlikely that increased leptin release from adipose tissues or glycogenolysis in the liver would be the primary mechanism involved. The most plausible explanation is that continued gut absorption of calories from the ingested meal would not occur during fasting periods. Instead, we can consider mechanisms that allow for glucose storage or mobilization.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
