["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the provided documents, it is clear that recurrent goiter is discussed in one of the documents. Carcinoma of the thyroid is another condition mentioned. However, the specific document discussing the complications of a large goitre is not explicitly stated. Therefore, we will need to rely on general knowledge and information from the other documents. A large goitre can cause compression of surrounding structures such as the oesophagus and trachea, leading to symptoms like stridor and hoarseness. This information is present in the document discussing carcinoma of the thyroid. No specific mention is made about dysphagia being an indication for surgery or thyrotoxicosis. Therefore, we can deduce that option A (It causes stridor due to compression of the oesophagus) is likely true.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
