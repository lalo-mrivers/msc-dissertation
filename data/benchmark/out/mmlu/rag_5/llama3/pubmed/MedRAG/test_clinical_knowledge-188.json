["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to the document 'Glycolysis-dependent antimetabolites: possible improvement in antineoplastic selectivity', glycolytic enzymes can reversibly associate to form heterogeneous enzyme-enzyme (binary) complexes. The document 'Regulation of skeletal muscle metabolism by enzyme binding' further suggests that these interactions provide an additional mechanism for regulating glycolytic flux. In the document 'Inhibition of glycolysis in hearts during ischemic perfusion', the rate of glycolysis was accelerated in anoxic conditions and inhibited in ischemic tissue, with inhibition developing at the level of glyceraldehyde-3-P dehydrogenase. This suggests that phosphofructokinase is not the rate-limiting enzyme. The document '6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, glucose-6-phosphate isomerase, and hexokinase activity ratios in some human tumor cytosols' does not provide direct information on the rate-limiting enzyme of glycolysis. However, based on the overall information provided, it can be inferred that phosphofructokinase is not the rate-limiting enzyme.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
