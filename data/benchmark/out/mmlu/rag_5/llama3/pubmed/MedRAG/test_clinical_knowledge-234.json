["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about sensory assessment of the arm. We need to find relevant information from the provided documents. The first document talks about peripheral nerve injuries of the upper extremity and sensory return. There is no specific information about pain, proprioception, or vibration sense. The second document discusses objective determinations of sensibility in the upper extremity and median nerve sensory conduction velocities. It doesn't provide relevant information for this question either. The third document talks about characteristics of motor programs underlying arm movements in monkeys. Although it's not directly related to sensory assessment, we can infer that proprioception is appreciated via separate tracts as light touch. The fourth document discusses sensory re-education after median nerve lesions and provides a technique for re-educating sensory function. There is no specific information about pain or vibration sense. Based on the provided documents, we can conclude that option B (Proprioception is appreciated via the same tracts as light touch) is true.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
