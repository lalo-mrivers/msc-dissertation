["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The atrioventricular (AV) bundle is a critical structure that enables conduction of electrical signals from the atria to the ventricles. From the provided documents, it is clear that the AV bundle is composed of Purkinje fibers, not autonomic nerve processes. This is evident in 'Identification of the conduction system in corrected transposition and common ventricle at operation' where the specialized conducting bundle was identified and avoided during surgery to prevent heart block. Similarly, in 'Pathological studies on atrioventricular conduction disturbances', the study revealed no correlation between histopathological changes and functional disturbances, suggesting that the AV bundle is a distinct structure.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
