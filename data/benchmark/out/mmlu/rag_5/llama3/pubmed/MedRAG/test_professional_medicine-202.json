["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has a history of urinary tract infection 12 months ago and is currently asymptomatic. The blood pressure readings are consistently elevated but not severely so. There is no evidence of end-organ damage or proteinuria. The patient is overweight, which may be contributing to the hypertension. Given the lack of severe hypertension and normal urinalysis, a hypertensive workup as per the guidelines for evaluating and treating hypertension is not necessary. The goal should be to prevent complications from untreated hypertension. A step-care approach with diuretics as the cornerstone of therapy is indicated.

Exercise and weight reduction program are reasonable steps to take in addition to starting antihypertensive treatment.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
