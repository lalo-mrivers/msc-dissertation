["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about what happens when a muscle fibre relaxes. In the provided documents, we see that relaxation rate was measured in vivo in normal human subjects. The study showed that type I fibres are utilized at low forces and type II fibres are recruited in addition at high forces. This physiological recruitment order has enabled us to measure the relaxation rate of type I and II fibres in vivo. The relaxation rate of type II fibres was calculated to be twice as fast as that of type I. From this, we can infer that muscle fibre relaxes when...\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
