["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the resynthesis of phosphocreatine (PC) during recovery from exercise. The study 'Resynthesis of creatine phosphate in human muscle after exercise in relation to intramuscular pH and availability of oxygen' shows that the limiting factor for PC resynthesis is either a low intramuscular pH or lack of oxygen. The study also shows that when the blood supply to the muscle is occluded, PC resynthesis is completely inhibited. This suggests that PC resynthesis requires an intact local circulation to the muscle, implying that it is not possible without adequate oxygen delivery.\", \"answer_choice\": D}"]
