["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about which karyotype is not compatible with survival to birth. From the given documents, we can see that Turner syndrome is characterized by a 45,X or 45,X/46,XX mosaicism (Chromosomal and clinical findings in 110 females with Turner syndrome). A further chromosome analysis in induced abortions shows that the frequency of chromosomal abnormalities was high at gestational week 5, but decreased gradually with advancing gestational weeks. Bone marrow chromosomes in acute lymphoblastic leukaemia also show a range of karyotypes, including hyperdiploidy and structural abnormalities.\n\nNow, let's look at the given choices: A, B, C, D. We can see that options A, B, and C all have an extra chromosome (+13, +18, or +21), which is consistent with survival to birth. Option D, 45,Y, on the other hand, is a common karyotype associated with Turner syndrome, which is not compatible with survival to birth.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that option D, 45,Y, is not compatible with survival to birth.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
