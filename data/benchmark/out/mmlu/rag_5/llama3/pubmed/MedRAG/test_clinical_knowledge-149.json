["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the heart's anatomy. From the provided documents, Cardiac hypertrophy: its characteristics as a growth process discusses three different levels of development: cytodifferentiation, embryogenesis and postnatal development. A heart model for understanding three-dimensional cardiac anatomy provides a description of the special relationships of the ventricles, valves and coronary arteries. The right ventricle in congenital heart disease focuses on lesions affecting primarily the right ventricle. Ultrastructure of heart muscle describes the ultrastructure of cardiac muscle, including comparative anatomy with skeletal muscles. Considering these documents, it seems that cardiac chambers are discussed in both A heart model for understanding three-dimensional cardiac anatomy and Ultrastructure of heart muscle. Therefore, I will focus on chamber discussion to answer this question.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
