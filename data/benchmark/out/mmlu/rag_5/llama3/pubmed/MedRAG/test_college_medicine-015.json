["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The scientist is testing the hearing of genetically modified mice that have lost their hearing. The mice are pressing a lever when they hear a bell at varying levels of power. The goal is to find the absolute threshold for hearing the decibels produced by the bell, which corresponds to the minimum level of power necessary for the mice to detect the sound. We can plot the results as a graph with the percentage of power on the x-axis and the number of mice responding (pressing the lever) on the y-axis. The absolute threshold would be the point where the response rate plateaus or drops to zero, indicating that the mice are no longer able to detect the sound at that level.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C\n}"]
