["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The World Systems Theory divides the world into three subcategories. Periphery countries are typically characterized by underdevelopment, poverty, and limited access to resources. Semi-periphery countries are situated between core and periphery countries, having some level of development but still facing challenges. Based on this, we can analyze the provided documents for clues about semi-periphery countries. In 'World health-related indicators', there is a discussion about differences in demographic and social characteristics, vital statistics, and resources among various regions. It highlights gross disparities between major areas of the world. South Asia and East Asia have more than half of the world's population, whereas Europe has less than one-third of its population under 20 years old. The report also mentions that urbanization is high in certain regions, but crude birth rates are close to three times higher in Africa, Middle America, and South Asia compared to Europe, North America, and USSR.\n\nConsidering these indicators, semi-periphery countries would likely exhibit some level of development, possibly with a mix of industrial and agricultural economies. They might have a relatively strong central government compared to periphery countries but not as developed as core countries. Given the disparities in demographics, vital statistics, and resources, we can infer that semi-periphery countries would have a diversified economy, unlike periphery countries which are often centered around one natural resource.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C: A diversified and developed economy.\""]
