["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to the documents, osteoclasts are responsible for bone resorption. In 'Inflammatory mediators and the destruction of bone', it is mentioned that cellular remodelling occurs in discrete packets of bone, and is regulated by local cytokines produced in the environment of the remodelling cells. These cytokines are secreted by immune cells and by bone cells. This suggests that osteoclasts are involved in resorption, rather than deposition.\n\nIn 'Osteoclast differentiation', it is stated that the osteoclast is the primary bone resorbing cell, which further supports this conclusion.\n\nFinally, in 'Quantitative analysis of the bone destroying activity of osteocytes and osteoclasts in experimental disuse osteoporosis', it is mentioned that osteoclasts are involved in bone destruction, which aligns with our previous conclusions.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that osteoclasts resorb bone.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D\n}"]
