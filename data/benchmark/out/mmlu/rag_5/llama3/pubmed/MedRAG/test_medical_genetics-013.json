["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the type of mutation that causes sickle-cell disease. After reviewing the documents, I found no direct mention of the specific mutation in sickle-cell disease. However, I can infer that the mutation is likely a point mutation based on the information provided. For example, in the document 'Sickle cell anemia: pathophysiology, management, and prospects for the future', it is mentioned that we currently understand a great deal about this disease on a molecular basis. This suggests that the mutation at the molecular level is a critical aspect of sickle-cell disease. Furthermore, point mutations are commonly associated with genetic disorders, including hemoglobinopathies like sickle-cell anemia.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
