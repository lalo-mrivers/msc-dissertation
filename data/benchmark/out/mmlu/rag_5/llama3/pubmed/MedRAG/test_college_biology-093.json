["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking which statement about fungi is NOT true. We can start by looking at the statements provided. Statement A says that all fungi are eukaryotic, which is supported by the fact that fungi are a type of eukaryote. Statement B states that all fungi have rigid cell walls, but this is not entirely accurate as some fungi such as yeast do not have rigid cell walls. Statement C claims that most fungi are filamentous, but again this is not true as some fungi like yeast are non-filamentous. Statement D says that some fungi are photosynthetic, which is also supported by the fact that some fungi can undergo photosynthesis. Therefore, considering all these points, we can conclude that statement B is NOT true.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
