["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"pH-induced changes of glycolysis can affect the rate of glycolysis. When the rate of glycolysis is high, pH changes are more likely to occur. An intracellular buffer can help limit these pH changes. The relevant documents mention that hexokinase and phosphofructokinase are influenced by changes in oxygenation state or temperature. This suggests that these enzymes play a crucial role in regulating the rate of glycolysis. Since 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase activity was higher than glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activity, it is unlikely to accumulate and inhibit glucose-6-phosphate channelling into glycolysis.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
