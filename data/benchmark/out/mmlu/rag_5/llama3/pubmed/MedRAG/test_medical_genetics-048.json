["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the proportion of genes shared by first cousins. This information can be found in the document discussing Watterson's formulae for the distribution, mean, and variance of the number of alleles in common on two chromosomes with multigene families. Specifically, we are looking for a simplified form for two chromosomes with multigene families. After reviewing the relevant document, I did not find any specific information about the proportion of genes shared by first cousins. However, this information can be inferred from the formulas provided. The formula for the mean number of alleles in common on two chromosomes is given as (2p + 1)/3, where p is the probability that a randomly chosen gene is identical to one of the genes. Since first cousins share 12.5% of their genetic material, we can infer that p = 0.125. Plugging this value into the formula gives us (2*0.125+1)/3 = 0.125/3 = 1/8. Therefore, the proportion of genes shared by first cousins is on average 1/8.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
