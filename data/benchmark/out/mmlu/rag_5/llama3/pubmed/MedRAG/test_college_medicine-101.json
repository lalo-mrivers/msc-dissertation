["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about alterations in neurotransmitters that influence fatigue development. From the given documents, we can see that chronic fatigue syndrome is characterized by profound fatigue. The paper 'Adaptation to fatigue of long duration in human wrist movements' discusses how subjects adapt to low-frequency fatigue by changing neural patterns controlling their muscles. There is no direct mention of neurotransmitters influencing fatigue development. However, the papers on 'Chronic Fatigue Syndrome' and 'Behavioural pharmacology of 5-HT3 receptor ligands' do not provide information relevant to this question either. Therefore, we need to look at other papers that discuss the role of neurotransmitters in fatigue development.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: Dopamine and serotonin\"\n}"]
