["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Understanding the role of p53 gene mutation in cell cycle arrest is crucial. The question states that the tumor cells contain a point mutation in the p53 gene (TP53), leading to an inactive gene product. This means that the p53 protein is not functional, which disrupts its ability to regulate the cell cycle. P53 is known for its role in regulating the G1 phase of the cell cycle by arresting it when DNA damage occurs. In the absence of functional p53, the cell cycle will continue unchecked, leading to uncontrolled growth and proliferation. Therefore, the progressive tumor growth despite irradiation therapy is most likely related to a defect in G1 phase cell cycle arrest.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
