["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the usefulness of twin studies in humans. The relevant documents describe various aspects of twin studies, including heritability estimates from twin studies, twin studies and behavior genetics, and twin studies of affective illness. One of the key points is that monozygotic (MZ) twins share all their genes, while dizygotic (DZ) twins share 50% of their genes on average. This allows researchers to estimate genetic factors by comparing the similarity between MZ and DZ pairs. Therefore, twin studies are useful because they allow genetic as opposed to environmental influences on variation in a trait to be estimated.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
