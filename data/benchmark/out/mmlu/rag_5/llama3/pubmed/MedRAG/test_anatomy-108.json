["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the thoracic cage as a structural unit that plays an important role in various functions. In one study, the rib cage dimensions were determined using anteroposterior and lateral chest radiographs performed at different lung volumes. The study found no significant differences in rib cage dimension between subjects with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and normal subjects for all lung volumes. This suggests that the thoracic cage is important for respiration. Additionally, another study described a limited computer-analyzed kinematic model of the rib cage that can be adapted to individual subjects. The positions of a small number of anatomic locations on the thoracic spine, ribs, manubrium, and sternum were measured from lateral and posterior-anterior chest radiographs. This suggests that the thoracic cage is important for respiration.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
