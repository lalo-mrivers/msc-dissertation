["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the initial energy source for very high force contractions lasting 1-2 seconds. We can look at the provided documents to find relevant information. The first document talks about myocardial oxygen consumption in isometric contraction, but it doesn't specifically mention high-force contractions. The second document talks about fatigue of long duration in human skeletal muscle after exercise, and it mentions that the twitch force is an unreliable measure of the state of fatigue, which isn't directly relevant to our question.\n\nThe third document discusses dependence of energy output on force generation during muscle contraction, which provides some useful information. It states that energy liberation in twitches appears to be uniquely determined by force generation and not by muscle length. This suggests that the initial energy source is related to force generation.\n\nThe fourth document talks about mechanical control of the rising phase of contraction of frog skeletal and cardiac muscle, but it doesn't provide direct information on high-force contractions lasting 1-2 seconds.\n\nFinally, we can look at the last document which discusses energy metabolism in type I and type II human muscle fibres during short term electrical stimulation at different frequencies. It mentions that whole muscle force production had declined to 84 and 77% of the initial force at 20 and 50 Hz, respectively, suggesting that high-force contractions may deplete ATP stores.\n\nBased on this information, it seems likely that the initial energy source for very high force contractions lasting 1-2 seconds is from ATP stores.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
