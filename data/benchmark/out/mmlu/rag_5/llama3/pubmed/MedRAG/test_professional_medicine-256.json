["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about a 22-year-old woman with urticaria. She has had several episodes over the past week, but this is her first episode of urticaria and it has occurred and then resolved several times in the past week. The history and physical examination disclose no abnormalities. Given that there are no other abnormalities found, it seems like acute urticaria. According to the provided documents, acute urticaria can be caused by histamine release, which is not fully established for localized heat urticaria but histamine was demonstrated as the dominant mediator in this condition. Therefore, I think treating the symptoms with non-sedative antihistamines would be a good approach.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
