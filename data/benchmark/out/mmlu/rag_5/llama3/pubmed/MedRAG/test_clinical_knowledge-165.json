["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks what peak flow meters record. We can look at the relevant documents for information on peak flow meters. The document 'Comparison of peak flow gauge and peak flow meter' mentions that both instruments measure Peak Expiratory Flow Rate (PEFR). From the other documents, we can see that PEFR is defined as the highest rate of air expelled from the lungs through an open mouth. Therefore, we can conclude that peak flow meters record the highest rate of air expelled from the lungs through an open mouth.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
