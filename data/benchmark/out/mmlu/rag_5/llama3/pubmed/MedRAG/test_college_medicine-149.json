["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant papers describe the role of creatine phosphokinase in cellular function and metabolism, highlighting its importance in energy transport from mitochondria to myofibrils. The [Creatine induction of creatine kinase synthesis] paper shows that creatine increases the activity of creatine kinase and reduces water-soluble proteins in developing muscle cells. The [Evidence for significant quantities of creatine kinase MM isoenzyme in human brain] paper confirms the presence of creatine kinase MM isoenzyme in human brain, which suggests a role for creatine kinase in energy metabolism outside of skeletal muscles. Finally, the [Creatine: a possible stimulus skeletal cardiac muscle hypertrophy] and [Effect of phosphoenolpyruvate on creatine kinase activity in rabbit muscles] papers demonstrate the regulatory role of creatine in muscle cells.\",\n\"answer_choice\": A\n}"]
