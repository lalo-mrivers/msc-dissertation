["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has suffered a broken neck with damage to the spinal cord at the level of the sixth cervical vertebra. Cervical spine injuries can be categorized according to the morbid anatomy of the lesion and most often, such injuries are successfully treated by surgery through a posterior approach. The relevant documents suggest that lower cervical spine injuries typically involve the craniocervical junction and the upper two cervical segments. Since the patient's injury is at the level of C6, it is likely to be a flexion or extension injury involving the cervico-dorsal region. In 34% of cases, the orthopaedic level of injury was found to be between C6 and T1, emphasizing the frequency of injury in this region. The documents also suggest that most fractures and dislocations in fatal traffic accidents were found to involve the craniocervical junction and the upper two cervical segments. Therefore, it is likely that the patient's breathing will be affected.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
