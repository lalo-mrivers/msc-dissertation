["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the physiological changes that occur with an increasing number of sprints. The provided documents discuss changes in blood lactate levels (peak BLa increased and the rate of BLa accumulation decreased with running distance) and EMG activity patterns (the increase in contact time was greatest immediately after runs of 100 and 300 m). These changes suggest a transition from aerobic to anaerobic energy production. Therefore, the correct answer is A: anaerobic contribution progressively increases.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
