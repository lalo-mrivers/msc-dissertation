["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents provided do not directly address the question about informal carers as of 2020. However, we can look for indirect clues or relevant information that might help us answer the question. From the 'A ten-point plan for meeting carers' needs' document, we know that representatives of a group of organizations in Britain joined together to commission a project to redress the balance of recognizing the needs of both people requiring extra care and those who look after them at home (carers). This suggests that carers were being recognized as an important aspect of healthcare. The 'Family caregivers want education for their caregiving roles' document also highlights the importance of educating family caregivers, indicating that they play a significant role in providing care.\n\nFrom the 'Meaning of caregiving' document, we see that many family members believed that caregiving was their responsibility by virtue of relationship or because no one else was available to assume the caregiving role. This implies that informal carers are not necessarily a new phenomenon and have been important for some time.\n\nTurning to the 'Family caregiver satisfaction with medical care of their demented relatives' document, we find that family caregivers were interviewed about their experience with medical care. While this does not directly address the question, it suggests that families have been involved in providing care for their loved ones.\n\nThe 'The family support group' document provides an informative guide for healthcare professionals on the importance of supporting families and friends. This reinforces the idea that informal carers are an important aspect of healthcare.\n\nBased on these indirect clues and relevant information, we can tentatively conclude that informal carers have been recognized as important for some time. The most relevant statement from the options provided is B: One in six over 65s is providing some form of informal care.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
