["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks with which relative an individual is most likely to share a common HLA haplotype. According to the document 'Ancestral haplotypes: conserved population MHC haplotypes', 73% of unselected haplotypes in our Caucasoid population are accounted for by ancestral haplotypes that extend from HLA-B to DR and have been conserved en bloc. This means that an individual is more likely to share a common HLA haplotype with their sibling, as siblings are the most likely to inherit the same ancestral haplotype from their parents.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
