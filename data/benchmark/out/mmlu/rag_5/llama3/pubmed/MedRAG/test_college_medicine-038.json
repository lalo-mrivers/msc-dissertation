["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the process of muscle contraction that requires ATP besides the power stroke. The power stroke is the tilting motion of the myosin head while attached to actin. According to the document 'Sliding distance between actin and myosin filaments per ATP molecule hydrolysed in skinned muscle fibres', a single tilting motion would produce about 12 nm of filament sliding, but the actual sliding distance per ATP molecule hydrolysed is at least 40 nm. This suggests that there might be another process requiring ATP besides the power stroke.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
