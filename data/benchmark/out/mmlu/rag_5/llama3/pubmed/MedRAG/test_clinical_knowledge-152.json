["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the type of covalent bonds that link amino acids in a protein. The relevant documents describe various types of chemical reactions and modifications, but they don't explicitly discuss the nature of the bonds between amino acids. However, we can infer from the context that the answer is peptide bonds. Peptide bonds are formed between the amino group of one amino acid and the carboxyl group of another, and they are a crucial aspect of protein structure.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
