["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the ability to detect differences in stimulus intensity. From the provided documents, it seems that the relevant information is from 'Recovery from prior stimulation. II: Effects upon intensity discrimination.' The document mentions 'large midlevel jnds were observed' and that these jnds are measured as a function of signal delay. This suggests that the ability to detect differences in stimulus intensity might be related to the time elapsed since the previous stimulation.\n\nLooking at the relevant documents again, we see that 'The masker-signal delay was 100 ms.' and that the jnds were not completely recovered by 400 ms. This implies that the brain takes some time to recover its ability to detect differences in stimulus intensity after prior stimulation.\n\nFrom this information, it seems that the ability to detect differences in stimulus intensity is best explained by the fact that the number of action potentials per second (C) varies with the stimulus intensity.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
