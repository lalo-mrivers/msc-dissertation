["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has a gunshot wound to the abdomen with an entrance wound in the left upper quadrant and an exit wound laterally in the left axillary line. The patient's vital signs are abnormal with a tachycardic pulse, hypotensive blood pressure, and tachypneic respirations.
