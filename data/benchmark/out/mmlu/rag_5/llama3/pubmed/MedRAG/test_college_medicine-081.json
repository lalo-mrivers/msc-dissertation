["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the pathway involving the conversion of. The relevant documents discuss glycolysis, which is the process by which glucose is converted into pyruvate or lactate. The document '[Origination and importance of glycolysis for malignomas and utilization of this property in the chemotherapy of cancer (author's transl)]' states that 'The formation of a strong capacity for glucose degradation via the Embden-Meyerhof pathway that cannot be fully utilized by the whole tumour in vivo is first of all designed to ensure survival and proliferation of cells even at extremely low levels of glucose supply.' This suggests that glycolysis involves the conversion of glucose into pyruvate or lactate. Additionally, the document 'Regulation of aerobic fermentation in protozoans. VI Comparative biochemistry of pathogenic and nonpathogenic protozoans' states that the oxidation is incomplete and results in a mixture of organic acid and carbon dioxide, which suggests that glycolysis also involves the conversion of glucose into pyruvate or lactate.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
