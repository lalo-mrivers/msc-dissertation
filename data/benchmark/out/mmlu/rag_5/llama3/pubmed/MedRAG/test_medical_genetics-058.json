["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about exons, specifically regarding protein-coding genes. The first statement suggests that some exons may consist of noncoding DNA, which is a correct concept. In protein-coding genes, the first exon typically contains the translational start site, but this is not universally true (Statement B). Similarly, the last exon does not always contain the normal termination codon (Statement C). Finally, coding exons can be translated in multiple reading frames, although it's less common to have a frame-shifted gene. Given this understanding, we can evaluate the options.\",\n\"answer_choice\": A"]
