["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The teacher's observation that performance on quizzes has increased significantly but tardiness has only decreased slightly suggests that the reward system is more effective for one behavior (quiz performance) than the other. The reward schedule for quiz performance involves a variable ratio schedule, where students are rewarded after a certain number of correct responses, whereas the reward schedule for punctuality involves a continuous reinforcement schedule, where students receive a sticker every day they show up on time. This suggests that the variable ratio schedule is more effective in increasing behavior, which aligns with the research suggesting that variable ratio schedules create the strongest responses and are less susceptible to extinction.\",\n\"answer_choice\": A"]
