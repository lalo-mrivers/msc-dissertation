["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has a fracture of the superior pubic ramus which is located near the membranous urethra. The retrograde urethrography was done to evaluate for a urethral disruption. Given that the patient presents with blood at the urethral meatus and pain elicited with motion of his pelvis, it is likely that the injury is related to the pelvic fracture. Therefore, the membranous urethra would be at greatest risk for injury due to its proximity to the fractured pubic bone.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
