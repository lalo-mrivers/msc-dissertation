["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's physical examination shows characteristics of Marfan syndrome, including a narrow palate with dental crowding, long slender extremities, and joint laxity. The molecular testing for FBN1 shows a single nucleotide difference that does not change the amino acid at that locus. This suggests that the mutation may be a polymorphism or sequence variant of unknown significance rather than a disease-causing mutation.\n\nThe mother has the same single nucleotide change as the patient, and there is no clinical evidence of Marfan syndrome in her. However, 15 of 200 individuals without Marfan syndrome also have this same nucleotide change, suggesting that it may be a polymorphism or sequence variant with no known functional significance.\n\nConsidering these findings, the single nucleotide change in the patient and her mother is likely to be either a polymorphism or sequence variant of unknown significance.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
