["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The molecule acts by binding to cytochrome oxidase A3. Cytochrome oxidase is the final enzyme in the electron transport chain and plays a crucial role in aerobic respiration. If this molecule blocks its function, it would prevent cells from passing electrons to oxygen, thus stopping aerobic respiration and asphyxiating the cells. This would likely lead to death.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
