["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to the documents, creatine phosphokinase isoenzymes play a key role in the intracellular energy transport from mitochondria to myofibrils and other sites of energy utilization. It has been shown that all isoenzymes of creatine phosphokinase from heart and skeletal muscle have very similar kinetic properties. In skeletal muscle cells, creatine phosphokinase is present mainly as cytosolic MM isoenzyme; about 6% of total cellular activity is localised also in mitochondria.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
