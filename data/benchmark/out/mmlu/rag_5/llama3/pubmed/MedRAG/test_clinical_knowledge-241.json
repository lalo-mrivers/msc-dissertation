["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the time it takes for pressure damage to become visible after a patient has been on the operating table for four hours. The article 'Pressure sores and intra-operative risk' mentions that there are few studies on the genesis of intra-operative pressure sores, but it does provide some information on interface pressures reported on operating tables. This suggests that the pressure damage may have already started during the four-hour period, but it would likely take some time for visible signs to appear. The article doesn't provide a specific time frame, but other sources suggest that pressure damage can occur in as little as 2-4 hours.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
