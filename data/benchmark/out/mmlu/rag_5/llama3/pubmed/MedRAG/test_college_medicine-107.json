["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents mention that the rate of glycolysis is higher in neoplastic cells. In addition, enzyme-enzyme complexes can form, which affect the overall glycolytic rate. The documents also provide data on enzymatic activities and ratios in human tumor cytosols. Finally, there are studies on glycolytic regulation in skeletal muscle and inhibition of glycolysis during ischemic perfusion. From these studies, it is inferred that phosphofructokinase is the rate-limiting enzyme of glycolysis.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
