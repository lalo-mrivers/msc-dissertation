["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The key to this question is understanding the mechanism of energy release during the transfer of two electrons from an NADH coenzyme to a flavoenzyme molecule. According to the provided document, the model proposes that during this process, two electrons are excited and then fall to their fundamental level, delivering two quanta of electronic excitation which help in the synthesis of one ATP molecule. Therefore, we can deduce that the energy released from the transfer of these electrons is enough to rephosphorylate 1 ATP. As each pair of electrons contains enough free energy to rephosphorylate 1 ATP, we can scale up this process for FADH2 and NADH+H pairs.\", \"answer_choice\": B}"]
