["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the provided documents, we know that the Golgi tendon organ (GTO) is a type of proprioceptive sensory receptor. Morphological evidence shows that the unmyelinated terminal branches of the Ib afferent fiber innervating the GTO lie within the spaces between braids of collagen. The mechanical events, which are presumed to occur within the GTO, appear to explain how it may function as a biological force transducer under static loading conditions. This suggests that the GTO is found at the junction between muscle and tendon.\", \"answer_choice\": B}"]
