["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to [A hypothesis about the organogenesis of the digestive tract], undifferentiated endodermal epithelium has an autodifferentiation potency. This suggests that the lining of the digestive tract develops from the endoderm. Similarly, [Functional and morphological differentiation of the allantoic endoderm under the influence of the proventricular mesenchyme in the avian embryo] shows that the allantoic endoderm differentiates into a proventriculus-type epithelium when associated with mesenchyme from the 5-6-day proventriculus, indicating that the digestive tract develops from the endoderm. Furthermore, [Establishment and organization of germ layers in the gastrulating mouse embryo] demonstrates the continuous recruitment of embryonic ectoderm cells to the definitive endoderm during gastrulation, further supporting the development of the lining of the digestive tract from the endoderm.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A: I only\"}"]
