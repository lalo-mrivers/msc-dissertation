["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the type of new mutations. The provided documents discuss various aspects of mutations, including their detection and consequences. One document mentions that most of the mutations are found in exons 10 and 11. This suggests that the mutations may be affecting the structure or function of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex. Since there is no direct information about the type of new mutations, we can infer from general knowledge that most mutations are neutral or deleterious. This is because natural selection tends to eliminate harmful mutations over time.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
