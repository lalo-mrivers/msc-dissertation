["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, specifically the study 'Heart rate during haemorrhagic shock' and 'Hypertonic solutions in the treatment of hypovolemic shock: a prospective, randomized study in patients admitted to the emergency room', it can be seen that heart rate is associated with estimated blood loss. The document states that in 18 patients with a blood loss of less than 31 l, corresponding to 34 (16-46) % of estimated blood volume, heart rate was 83 (60-160) beats min-1 and mean arterial pressure was 62 (35-73) mmHg. This suggests that hypovolaemic shock is associated with a relatively low heart rate.\n\nIn the same document, it states that in 16 patients with a blood loss of more than 3 l, corresponding to 89 (35-100) % of estimated blood volume, heart rate was 120 (110-160) beats min-1 and mean arterial pressure was 52 (0-70) mmHg. This suggests that profound bleeding is associated with tachycardia.\n\nBased on this information, it can be inferred that the percentage of blood loss before changes in heart rate and blood pressure occur is more than 34 (16-46) % but less than 89 (35-100) %.\n\nThe other documents provided do not directly address the question of what percentage of blood can be lost before it is reflected in changes in heart rate and blood pressure. Therefore, the answer must be based on the information provided in the study 'Heart rate during haemorrhagic shock'.\n\nSince the study does not provide an exact percentage of blood loss corresponding to a specific change in heart rate, we need to look at the median and range values provided. The median blood loss is 31 l, which corresponds to 34 (16-46) % of estimated blood volume.\n\nHowever, this value is based on the median blood loss, not the maximum or average blood loss. The study also states that there were 6 patients who died due to severe bleeding with a heart rate of 129 (110-160) beats min-1 and mean arterial pressure of 40 (0-70) mmHg.\n\nBased on this information, it can be inferred that the percentage of blood loss before changes in heart rate and blood pressure occur is likely greater than 34 (16-46) % but less than 89 (35-100) %.\", \"answer_choice\": C}"]
