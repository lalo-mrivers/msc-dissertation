["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about a component of transcribed RNA that is present in the initial transcript but removed before translation occurs. The provided documents discuss transcription and translation processes in eukaryotes, including units of transcription and translation, RNA nucleocytoplasmic transport, and DNA intervention in transcriptional activation. The information suggests that introns are non-coding regions within genes that are transcribed into the primary transcript but removed during splicing before translation occurs.\",\n\"answer_choice\": A"]
