["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, specifically 'Further studies on the effects of dihydrotestosterone on gonadotrophin release induced by LH-RH in men' and 'Endocrine therapy for prostate cancer', it is clear that male hormones are produced by the testes. The first document states that dihydrotestosterone (DHT) inhibits basal LH-RH and gonadotrophin secretion, which suggests that the testes play a role in producing these hormones. Additionally, the second document discusses the synthesis of androgens from inactive precursors in peripheral tissues, including the normal and cancerous prostate, but notes that the testes contribute only 60% of total androgens. This implies that the testes are the primary source of male hormones.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
