["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about a solution to complete bladder washout after a blocked catheter. The patient has just undergone transurethral resection of prostate with irrigation, which means there was likely postoperative drainage of the bladder using an indwelling catheter, possibly the TUR-Catheter mentioned in one of the documents.
