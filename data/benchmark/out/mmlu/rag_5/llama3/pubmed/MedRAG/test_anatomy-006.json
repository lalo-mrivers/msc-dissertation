["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the anatomical region of abdomen that lies just distal to the sternum. After reviewing the provided documents, we can eliminate options D: Lumbar and C: Hypogastric as they are not located near the sternum. Options B: Hypochondriac is also eliminated because it refers to the area between the costal margin and the xiphoid process of the 7th rib, which is too far from the sternum. Therefore, we are left with option A: Epigastric, which corresponds to the region between the xiphoid process and the costal margin of the 4th rib, and it lies just distal to the sternum.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
