["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the provided documents, we can see that saliva proteases are present. Whole saliva proteases can cleave substrate protein patterns on PAGE examination. We also know that parotid saliva enzymes were analyzed for acid phosphatase, nonspecific esterase, and amylase in Down's syndrome patients. Esterase activity was significantly elevated in those with Down's syndrome. Based on these findings, we can conclude that saliva contains an enzyme that acts upon proteins.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
