["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the composition of dorsal roots. From the provided documents, we can infer that the first document states that there are more dorsal root axons than dorsal root ganglion cells, indicating that sensory axons dominate. The second document does not provide direct information on dorsal roots but talks about aberrant nerve fibers in the central nervous system. The third document discusses changes in the superficial dorsal horn following peripheral axotomy and the possible extension of fine primary afferent fibers into lamina III and IV. The fourth document is unrelated to this question. Therefore, based on the first document, we can conclude that the answer is A: sensory neuronal processes.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
