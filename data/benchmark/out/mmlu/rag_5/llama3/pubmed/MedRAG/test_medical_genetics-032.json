["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking what causes Familial Hypercholesterolaemia. The relevant documents describe two types of Familial Hypercholesterolaemia: one caused by LDL receptor mutations and another caused by a mutation in the gene for apo B-100. Since both descriptions point to defects in the LDL receptor or apo B-100, we can infer that Familial Hypercholesterolaemia is caused by mutations in the genes which encode these proteins.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
