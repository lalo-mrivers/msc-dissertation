["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents provide information on maxillary growth. Study 1 mentions that prior to lip repair, cleft and normal subjects showed similar patterns of maxillary growth. This similarity was not apparent by age two. Anterior-posterior growth inhibition of the maxilla appeared to occur after lip repair and to remain a problem by age four. Study 3 discusses primary veloplasty which enables normal growth of the upper jaw and of the facial skeleton in patients with clefts. Study 4 discusses biological research related to orthodontics, including investigation of craniofacial growth and development. This information suggests that postnatal maxillary growth continues beyond age four. Therefore, we can conclude that the correct statement about postnatal growth of the maxilla is...\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
