["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the symplastic pathway for sucrose movement from mesophyll cells to phloem. The relevant information comes from the first document which describes the expression and localization of a 62-kD sucrose binding protein in tissues actively engaged in sucrose transport, including the mesophyll cells of young sink leaves and the companion cells of mature phloem. This suggests that the symplastic pathway involves the movement of sucrose from mesophyll cells into the phloem through the companion cells.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C: Companion cells, phloem parenchyma, fibers, sieve tube\"\n}"]
