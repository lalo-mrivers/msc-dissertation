["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to the provided documents, growth cones are highly motile structures found at the tips of growing axons. Microspikes of the growth cone extend and retract to move the growth cone forward. Exposure to cytochalasin B can affect microtubules in the axon or microfilaments in the microspike. We know that microtubule assembly is involved in neurite advance, specifically at the growth cone. Therefore, it's likely that microtubules are affected by exposure to cytochalasin B.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
