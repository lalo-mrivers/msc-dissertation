["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The provided documents describe gastrulation as the process of converting a single layer of cells into an outer ectodermal covering, an inner ectodermal tube, and in triploblastic phyla, a middle mesodermal layer. This process involves directed cell movements, interactions, and changes in cell fate and gene expression. From this information, we can infer that gastrulation is the formation of multiple germ layers, which is supported by the description of gastrulation as a double-phasic process in birds and mammals, involving entoderm individualization, mesoderm individualization, and chorda formation.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
