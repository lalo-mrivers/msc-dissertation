["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents discuss the possibility of intergenerational transmission of effects from parental exposures. Specifically, Perinatal and multigenerational effect of carcinogens mentions that exposure to carcinogens in utero or prezygotically can result in an increased incidence of cancer not only in immediate but also in subsequent generations. Intergenerational studies of human birthweight from the 1958 birth cohort suggests a multigenerational influence on birthweight passed through the maternal line. Parental-specific methylation of an imprinted transgene is established during gametogenesis and progressively changes during embryogenesis, indicating that distinctive patterns emerge during germ cell maturation. Therefore, it can be inferred that intergenerational transmission to offspring can occur as a result of parental exposures to carcinogens.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: all of these\""]
