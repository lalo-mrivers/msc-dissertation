["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The problem is about an object resting on a plane with an angle of incline ?, acceleration due to gravity g, and coefficient of friction Âµ. We need to find the acceleration of the object. This requires consideration of the forces acting on the object: normal force, weight (due to gravity), and frictional force. The key to solving this problem is recognizing that the net force acting on the object in the direction of motion is zero, as there is no external force causing it to move.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C\n}"]
