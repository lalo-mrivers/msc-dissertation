["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for a central painful stimulus, which implies that the stimulus should be applied to the brain or spinal cord. Based on this understanding, I will analyze each option. Option A (Supra-orbital ridge pressure) and Option C (Trapezius squeeze) are both applied to muscles or bones, but they do not directly stimulate the central nervous system. Option B (Pressure on the little finger pulp) is applied to a peripheral nerve and does not directly stimulate the central nervous system either. Option D (Sternal rub) could potentially be a central painful stimulus as it involves pressure on the sternum, which could stimulate the thoracic spine or even the brain.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
