["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents suggest that free fatty acids are transported in the blood. In 'Diminished plasma free fatty acid clearance in obese subjects', it is mentioned that clearance of FFA is impaired in obesity and denoted esterification in tissues such as muscle and adipose tissue. This implies that FFA may be transported with lipoproteins. In 'Lipoproteins and lipid transport', it is stated that both triglycerides and cholesteryl esters are transported in the 'core' of lipoproteins, which further supports this idea.\", \"answer_choice\": B}"]
