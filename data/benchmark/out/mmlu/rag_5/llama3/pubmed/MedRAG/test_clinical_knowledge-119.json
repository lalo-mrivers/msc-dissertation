["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about circulatory overload. In the relevant documents, I find that congestive heart failure can result from inadequate myocardial contraction (systolic myocardial failure), or from failure of the ventricles to fill at low pressure (diastolic myocardial failure). Circulatory overload is not mentioned as a cause of systolic or diastolic dysfunction. However, in the document 'Congestive heart failure: pathophysiology and management with special reference to systemic hypertension', I find that increased ventricular systolic pressure raises myocardial oxygen demand, resulting in ischemic heart syndromes and arrhythmias. This suggests that circulatory overload may be related to high blood pressure. The symptoms mentioned in the question, such as dyspnoea, tachycardia, and distended neck veins, are consistent with congestive heart failure due to circulatory overload.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D\n}"]
