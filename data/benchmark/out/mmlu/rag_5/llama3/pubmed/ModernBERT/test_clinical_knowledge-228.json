["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about antibacterial properties present in saliva. The relevant documents provided are not explicitly mentioning antibacterial actions in saliva. However, one document (Antimicrobial x-ray contrast articles) mentions antimicrobial substances and another (Antiviral activity in milk of possible clinical importance) talks about antiviral activity in milk. Neither of these seems directly related to the question. A quick scan of the titles doesn't reveal any mention of antibacterial properties in saliva. It appears that Lysozyme is often associated with antibacterial properties and it's present in human saliva, so this might be a good candidate.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
