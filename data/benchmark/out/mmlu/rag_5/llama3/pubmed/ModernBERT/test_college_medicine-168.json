["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the blood glucose concentration during high intensity exercise. The relevant documents mention VO2 max, insulin sensitivity, and glucose assimilation during muscular effort. From the 'Study of the coefficient of glucose assimilation during muscular exercise in diabetic adolescents deprived of insulin' document, it can be inferred that a minimal concentration of insulin is necessary to increase glucose utilization during physical activity. This suggests that blood glucose concentration may not change significantly during high intensity exercise. The 'Oxygen transport system during exhaustive exercise in Japanese boys' document mentions VO2 max and its relation to age, but does not provide information about blood glucose concentration during exercise. The 'Effect of prolonged ethanol intake on glucose metabolism in normal rats' document is unrelated to the question. On the other hand, 'High-density lipoprotein, lipid, and carbohydrate metabolism during increasing fitness' mentions changes in glucose and insulin responses, but these changes were observed over a period of 10 weeks due to exercise, not during high intensity exercise.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
