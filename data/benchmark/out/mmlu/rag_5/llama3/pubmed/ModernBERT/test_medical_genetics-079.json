["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about recognized complications of cystic fibrosis. The provided documents mention life tables for cystic fibrosis, but do not specifically discuss the complications. However, another document 'Clinical types of diabetes mellitus' mentions that while it is widely accepted that diabetes mellitus is a disorder characterized by impaired carbohydrate tolerance, there is no clear-cut distinction between normal and abnormal. This suggests that diabetes mellitus might be related to cystic fibrosis. On the other hand, Reye's syndrome is mentioned in another document, which does not seem directly related to cystic fibrosis. The remaining options mention congenital absence of vas deferens and liver cirrhosis, both of which are known complications of cystic fibrosis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"]
