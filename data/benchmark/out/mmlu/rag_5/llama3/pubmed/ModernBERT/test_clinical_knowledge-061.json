["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Since the documents provided are unrelated to rectal findings or prostate issues, I will consider each option individually. Option A talks about a palpable median groove in the prostate, which is not related to possible rectal findings. Options B and C seem more relevant, as they mention faeces and haemorrhoids, which are both connected to the rectum.

Option D also seems plausible, as proctoscopy is an invasive procedure used to examine the rectum and its contents.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
