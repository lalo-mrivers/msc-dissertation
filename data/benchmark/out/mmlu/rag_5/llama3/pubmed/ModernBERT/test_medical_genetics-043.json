["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the provided documents, I did not find any direct mention of nonsense mutation. However, in genetics, a nonsense mutation is a type of point mutation that results in premature termination of protein synthesis. This occurs when a codon (a sequence of three nucleotides) that normally codes for an amino acid is replaced with a stop codon. In this case, the correct answer would be D: the creation of a stop codon.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
