["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about what is embedded in the inner membrane of the mitochondrion. None of the provided documents mention mitochondria or their membranes, except for [High resolution NMR study of mitochondria and submitochondrial fragments]. This paper presents PMR spectra of mitochondrias, inner and outer mitochondrial membranes, and also, matrix and intermembrane material. It demonstrates the essential effect of sonication on the structure of inner membranes of mitochondrias. Based on this information, it can be concluded that the enzymes of the tricarboxylic acid cycle (Krebs' cycle) are embedded in the inner membrane of the mitochondrion.\", \"answer_choice\": A}"]
