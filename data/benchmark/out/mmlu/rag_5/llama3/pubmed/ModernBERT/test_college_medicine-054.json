["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks which process is not used to modify protein structure after translation has occurred. I will review the relevant documents. From 'Prediction of protein structure from amino acid sequence', I see that the focus is on predicting 3D structures, but there is no mention of modifying structure after translation. In 'Protein export in Escherichia coli', the topic is protein export and translocation, which doesn't seem related to modifying protein structure. 'Models for mRNA translation' discusses translation rates, not post-translation modification. 'Recognition of nascent polypeptides for targeting and folding' talks about protein recognition and folding, but again, no mention of modifying structure after translation. Finally, in 'Putting energy into mitochondrial protein import', the topic is protein import into mitochondria, which doesn't involve modifying protein structure after translation.\n\nThe only process mentioned that involves modifying protein structure after translation is glycosylation, which occurs when a sugar molecule is added to a protein. This process does modify the protein's structure. Lipidation and phosphorylation also occur after translation and can modify protein structure. Attachment of more amino acids via peptide bonds is not a common mechanism for modifying protein structure.\n\nBased on this analysis, I conclude that glycosylation is the only process that is not used to modify protein structure after translation has occurred.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
