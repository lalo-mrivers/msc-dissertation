["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the molecules that will stop being produced first when oxygen is no longer supplied to the cell. The relevant documents don't explicitly discuss this topic. However, one of the documents mentions a process where the interior of a squid giant axon is loaded with acid and the cell responds by extruding that acid in an energy-requiring process, which suggests that ATP is involved in this process. This implies that ATP might be produced first when oxygen is no longer supplied to the cell.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
