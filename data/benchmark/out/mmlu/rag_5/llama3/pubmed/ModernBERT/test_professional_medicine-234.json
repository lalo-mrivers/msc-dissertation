["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the properties of a killed vaccine relative to a live vaccine. Since we're dealing with a newly identified virus, there's no prior immunity or experience with either type of vaccine. Therefore, I'll focus on the aspects that are specific to killed vaccines. Vaccinia virus and influenza are both mentioned in the provided documents, but neither has a direct connection to the newly discovered virus. Prion diseases are not relevant here as they're not viruses. Since the question is asking about the most appropriate rationale for developing a killed vaccine, I'll consider the benefits of a killed vaccine over a live one.\n\nInfluenza vaccines are mentioned as having improved purification processes, which reduces reactions. This suggests that killed vaccines can be designed to minimize adverse effects. The documents also mention the difficulty in preparing an effective vaccine against influenza due to changes in surface antigens. A killed vaccine for this newly discovered virus could potentially offer a similar advantage by being more predictable and controllable.\n\nAmong the options, C seems like the most logical choice as it highlights one of the primary benefits of a killed vaccine: reduced concern about reversion to virulence. This property is particularly relevant when dealing with an unknown or previously unencountered virus.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
