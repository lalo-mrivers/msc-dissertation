["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The article discusses the effects of sauna use on the body. It mentions that during sauna use, the skin heats first, rising to 40°C (104°F), and then changes in core body temperature occur, rising slowly from 37°C (98.6°F) to 38°C (100.4°F) and then rapidly increasing to 39°C (102.2°F). This indicates that sauna use causes a rise in body temperature. The article also mentions that approximately 50 to 70 percent of the body's blood flow is redistributed from the core to the skin to facilitate sweating, which suggests that sauna use causes increased sweat loss. Considering these physiological responses, it would be important for a person to replenish fluids with filtered water after sauna use.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: Replenish fluids with filtered water.\""]
