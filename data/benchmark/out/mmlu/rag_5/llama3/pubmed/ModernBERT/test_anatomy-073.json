["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about an unfavourable fracture of the body of the mandible. The mandible has a unique anatomy with multiple muscles attached to it. The digastric muscle attaches anteriorly and inferiorly, the lateral pterygoid muscle attaches posteriorly and superiorly, the medial pterygoid muscle attaches posteriorly and inferiorly, and the temporalis muscle attaches posteriorly and superiorly. Considering the location of the fracture as unfavourable, I would expect the fragments to be displaced by the muscles that act on them. In this case, the anterior fragment is likely to be displaced by the action of the medial pterygoid muscle.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
