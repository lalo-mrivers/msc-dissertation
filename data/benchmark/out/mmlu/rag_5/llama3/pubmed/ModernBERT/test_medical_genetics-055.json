["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Since the level of glucose is low, it means that cAMP levels are high.

A mutation in the repressor that prevents binding to lactose would effectively remove the repression of the lac operon, allowing it to be expressed constitutively.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
