["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about genetic disorders such as alkaptonuria and albinism. Albinism is caused by a lack of melanin production due to mutations in genes involved in the synthesis of melanin. This suggests that recessive inheritance may play a role, as both parents must be carriers of the mutated gene for the child to express the condition. Similarly, alkaptonuria is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by a deficiency in the enzyme homogentisate oxidase. No information about X or Y chromosomes is provided.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
