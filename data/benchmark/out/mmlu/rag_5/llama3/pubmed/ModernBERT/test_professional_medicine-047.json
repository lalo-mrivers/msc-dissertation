["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"In this scenario, the efferent arteriole is constricted with a vascular clamp, which increases the resistance to blood flow. This means that there will be increased pressure in the glomerulus due to the constriction of the efferent arteriole. Therefore, the Starling force that is most likely to change in the glomeruli is the hydrostatic pressure.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
