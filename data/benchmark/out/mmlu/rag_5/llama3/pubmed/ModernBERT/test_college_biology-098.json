["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the polytene chromosomes seen in Drosophila silvarentis. The term 'polytene' refers to a type of chromosome that is formed through repeated rounds of DNA replication followed by nuclear division. This process is described in detail in the document [The Balbiani ring and the polytene chromosomes of Drosophila bicornuta], which discusses the formation of polytene chromosomes during larval development and after in vitro ecdysterone treatment. Given that this document describes polytene chromosomes as being formed through repeated rounds of DNA replication followed by nuclear division, it is likely that the polytene chromosomes seen in Drosophila silvarentis have a similar origin.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
