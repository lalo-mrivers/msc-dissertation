["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"None of the provided documents directly address stroke volume or its regulation. However, we can infer that the factors regulating stroke volume are preload, contractility, and afterload based on the concept of cardiac output. Cardiac output is determined by stroke volume and heart rate. Stroke volume is influenced by three primary factors: blood pressure (afterload), venous return (preload), and myocardial contractility. Therefore, we can conclude that the correct answer is B: Preload, contractility, and afterload.\", \"answer_choice\": B}"]
