["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the component of transcribed RNA in eukaryotes that is present in the initial transcript but removed before translation occurs. The relevant documents mention the processing of primary transcripts and the presence of introns, which are non-coding regions that are excised from the final mRNA product. Intron removal is a common feature of eukaryotic gene expression, where intronic sequences are spliced out to form the mature mRNA.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
