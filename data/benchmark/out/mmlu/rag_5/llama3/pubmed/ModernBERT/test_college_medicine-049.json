["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To solve this problem, we need to first balance the equation. The unbalanced equation is:\n\nC2H4 + O2 → CO2 + H2O\n\nWe can balance it by multiplying both sides of the equation by 3 to get:\n\n3C2H4 + 9O2 → 3CO2 + 3H2O\n\nNow we can calculate the number of moles of carbon dioxide produced. The molar mass of ethane is 30 g/mol, so:\n\nmoles ethane = 84 g / 30 g/mol = 2.8 mol\n\nThe reaction produces 3 moles of CO2 per mole of ethane, so:\n\nmoles CO2 = 2.8 mol * 3 = 8.4 mol\n\nFinally, we can calculate the mass of CO2 produced by multiplying the number of moles by the molar mass (44 g/mol):\n\nmass CO2 = 8.4 mol * 44 g/mol = 264 g\n\n\", \"answer_choice\": C}"]
