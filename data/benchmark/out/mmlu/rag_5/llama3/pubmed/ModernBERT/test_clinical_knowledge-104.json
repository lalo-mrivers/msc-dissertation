["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents mention various biochemical concepts such as amino acids, proteins, retinoic acid, haptens, and transfer ribonucleic acid. Based on this information, I can infer that the question is likely related to biochemistry or molecular biology. The options provided are a mix of known amino acids (Glutamic acid, Aspartic acid) and an unknown substance (Palmitic acid). Given the context, Palmitic acid seems out of place. Glutamine could be either an amino acid or a non-standard term for glutamic acid. Therefore, I deduce that Palmitic acid is not an amino acid.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
