["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about recording peak flow results, which seems to be related to lung function testing. The relevant documents suggest that the Wright respirometer is used for measurements at small rates of flow associated with small volumes, and accuracy is very dependent on the wave form of the flow passing through it. This implies that the device is sensitive to changes in air flow. Considering this information, I think the question is asking about the variation allowed in peak flow results when recording three readings. The documents do not provide a direct answer to this question, but they suggest that small variations are possible and measurable.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
