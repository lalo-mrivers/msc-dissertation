["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about glycogen breakdown in muscle. We have to analyze the relevant documents for information on glycogen metabolism. The first document talks about ozone damaging protoplasts and has no relation to glycogen breakdown. The second document discusses glycogen synthase activity, which implies that it's related to glycogen synthesis, not breakdown. The third document talks about pancreatic duct hypertension and has no direct connection to muscle glycogen breakdown. The fourth document describes changes in protein composition during Zenker's necrosis, but doesn't specifically discuss glycogen metabolism. Therefore, we must look for information on glycogen breakdown in the provided documents.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
