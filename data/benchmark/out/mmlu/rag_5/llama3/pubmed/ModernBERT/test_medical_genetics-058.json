["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Exons are DNA sequences that are part of a protein-coding gene. Protein-coding genes have multiple exons that are spliced together to form the final mRNA sequence. The first exon is likely to contain the translational start site, but it's not always the case. The last exon may or may not contain the termination codon. A coding exon can be translated in all three possible forward reading frames (ATG, GTG, TTG), depending on the genetic code. Therefore, we need to evaluate each option carefully.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
