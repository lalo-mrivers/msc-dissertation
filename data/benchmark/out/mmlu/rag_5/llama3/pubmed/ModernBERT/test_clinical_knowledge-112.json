["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Since the question is about shampoo being used for washing the skin when showering or bathing, I will look through the provided documents. None of the documents mention anything about shampoo or using it on the skin. The first document talks about keeping dressings moist prior to delayed skin grafting, which doesn't relate to the question. The second document discusses swabs and their usage in operating rooms, also not relevant. The third document highlights drain-cover injuries caused by falling gratings, which is a physical injury and not related to shampoo or skin care. The fourth document talks about PUVA treatment for psoriasis using filtered sunlight, again unrelated to the question. Therefore, I will have to rely on general knowledge and experience in medicine. Shampoos are formulated for cleaning hair, not skin, and can be harsh and drying if used on the skin. Thus, it is best not to use shampoo on the skin when showering or bathing.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
