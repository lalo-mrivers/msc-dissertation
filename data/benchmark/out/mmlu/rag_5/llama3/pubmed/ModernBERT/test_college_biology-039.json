["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the development of a vertebrate organism from zygote to fetus. The relevant documents provide information on early embryogenesis, fertilization, and the timing of events during embryonic development.

This is because the timing and sequence of events in the development of the human vertebral column are similar to those found in other vertebrates. Therefore, drawing a conclusion about the similarity between early human embryos and early fish or avian embryos is justified.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
