["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about loss of somatic sensation over the anterior two-thirds of the tongue. This information can be found in the paper 'Frog's tongue receptive areas: neural organization and gustatory function'. According to this paper, the lateral branch of the frog's IXth nerve innervates the rostral third (anterior) of the tongue surface.

Therefore, damage to this nerve would result in loss of somatic sensation over the anterior two-thirds of the tongue.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
