["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about antibiotics that affect bacterial cells. The provided documents are related to cancer treatment and the activity of certain compounds against viral and neoplastic cells. Therefore, I will focus on information about antibacterial agents. From my understanding of general microbiology, bacteria have a cell wall composed of peptidoglycan (also known as murein). Antibiotics that affect bacterial cells may interfere with its synthesis. In addition, antibiotics can also target protein synthesis, DNA synthesis, or other processes essential for bacterial survival. Reverse transcriptase is an enzyme involved in the replication of retroviruses and not directly related to antibacterial agents.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
