["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the Golgi tendon organ. Based on the provided documents, there is no direct mention of the Golgi tendon organ. However, we can look for relevant information about proprioceptive receptors or sensory receptors in muscles and tendons. Upon reviewing the documents, we find that [Morphology of the heart conduction system] mentions the heart conduction system's blood supply, but does not provide information on muscle-tendon receptors. We also do not find any relevant information on radiological signs, coiled springs, or microscope illumination methods. This leaves us to focus on occupational medicine, which does not seem directly related to Golgi tendon organs either. Therefore, we need to rely on general medical knowledge and textbook definitions. According to standard physiology texts, the Golgi tendon organ is a proprioceptive sensory receptor found at the junction between muscle and tendon.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
