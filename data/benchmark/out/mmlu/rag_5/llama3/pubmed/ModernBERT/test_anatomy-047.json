["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"I will start by reviewing the provided documents. None of the texts mention anything about cells in the blood or their nuclei. However, one document mentions red blood cell ghosts, which suggests that it might be related to red blood cells. Another document talks about granulation tissue in the umbilical cord, but this seems unrelated to the question. The other two documents discuss different topics altogether, such as cytoplasmic bodies and inhibitory zones. Therefore, I will focus on the document about red blood cell ghosts. This document reveals that human red blood cell ghosts are actually solid bodies of distorted shapes, which suggests that red blood cells do not have a nucleus. Hence, I will conclude that erythrocytes (red blood cells) are the cells in the blood that do not have a nucleus.\", \"answer_choice\": C}"]
