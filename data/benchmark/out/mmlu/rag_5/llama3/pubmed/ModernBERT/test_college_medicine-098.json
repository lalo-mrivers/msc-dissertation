["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking which cellular activity would likely be most affected by a vast reduction of MAPs function. Given that the MAPs stabilize microtubules, it's likely that the cellular activity that relies heavily on microtubules would be most affected. Among the options, meiosis is the one that involves cell division and spindle formation, which are crucial processes that rely on microtubules. Therefore, a vast reduction of MAPs function would likely disrupt these processes.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
