["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The provided documents don't mention anything about the body compensating for increased environmental temperature. However, a relevant document that doesn't seem to be related to the question is 'Value of temperature profiles of injured legs (author's transl)', which discusses thermographic control studies and temperature profiles. Another irrelevant document is 'An equipment logging system', which describes Strafoplan logging in an Intensive Care Unit. The documents 'Defining employee status' and '[Use of the \"exposure level-body condition\" relations for evaluation of the effects of complex atmospheric pollution]' seem to be more relevant, but they don't provide information about how the body compensates for increased environmental temperature. Therefore, we need to look beyond these documents and consider general knowledge about thermoregulation in humans.\", \"answer_choice\": C}"]
