["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about an individual born with a mutation that causes them to retain fetal hemoglobin into adulthood. This means that adult hemoglobin (HbA) was not fully replaced by HbF as it usually does after birth. Since the individual still has some HbF, this would likely affect their physiology. Hemoglobin's main function is to transport oxygen in the blood. Fetal hemoglobin has a higher affinity for oxygen than adult hemoglobin. This means that it can bind to oxygen more easily and efficiently. Therefore, the individual with partial retention of fetal hemoglobin into adulthood would exhibit increased oxygen binding to hemoglobin in the tissues.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
