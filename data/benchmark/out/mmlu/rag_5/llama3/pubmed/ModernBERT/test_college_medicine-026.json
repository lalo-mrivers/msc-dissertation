["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The problem involves the frequency change due to motion. The sound technician needs to consider the Doppler effect, which is a fundamental concept related to the perceived frequency change when an observer is moving relative to the source of the sound. In this case, both the actor and the camera are moving. To solve this problem, we need to apply the Doppler formula, which states that the perceived frequency (f') is equal to the original frequency (f) multiplied by the ratio of the source velocity (v1) and observer velocity (v2). The relevant documents provide information about binaural localization and motion effects, but they do not directly address this specific problem. However, we can still use the concept of minimum audible movement angle (MAMA) to understand the motion effect on perceived frequency. MAMA is related to the source velocity and observer velocity. In this case, the source velocity is 108 km/h and the observer velocity is 72 km/h.\n\nApplying the Doppler formula, we get:\n\nf' = f * (v1 + v2) / (v1 - v2)\n\nSubstituting the given values, we get:\n\nf' = 800 Hz * ((108 km/h + 72 km/h) / (108 km/h - 72 km/h))\n= 800 Hz * (180 km/h / 36 km/h)\n= 800 Hz * (5)\n= 4000 Hz\n\nSince the frequency is above the human audible range, we need to apply the concept of minimum audible movement angle (MAMA) to get an estimate of the perceived frequency. The MAMA increases as the source velocity increases. In this case, the source velocity is relatively high at 108 km/h. Assuming a reasonable value for MAMA in this context, let's assume it's around 15-20 degrees.\n\nThe relevant document on binaural localization and motion effects provides information about the minimum audible movement angle (MAMA) increasing as the source velocity increases. Using this concept, we can estimate the perceived frequency by considering the motion effect. However, this is a rough estimate and not an exact calculation.\n\nBased on these considerations, I'm going to choose the option that seems most plausible given the context.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
