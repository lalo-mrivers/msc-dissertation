["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the motion of bending the forearm toward the body. This description suggests a movement that brings the forearm closer to the body. Based on this information, I can eliminate options A (abduction) and B (eversion), as these terms describe movements away from or outward from the body, respectively. Option D (pronation) is also unlikely, as it describes rotation of the forearm, not bending towards the body. Therefore, I am left with option C (flexion).\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
