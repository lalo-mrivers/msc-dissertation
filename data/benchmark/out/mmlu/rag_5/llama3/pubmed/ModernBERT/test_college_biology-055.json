["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the fate of two separated blastomeres from an amphibian zygote, one containing the gray crescent. The gray crescent is known to be essential for development and formation of a complete embryo (from the document 'Electrondense cell inclusions of the human cone inner segments'). Therefore, it's expected that the blastomere with the gray crescent will have an advantage in terms of development and growth compared to the one without. This suggests option A: The blastomere with the gray crescent will grow in size more quickly than the one without the gray crescent.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
