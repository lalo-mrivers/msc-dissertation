["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about branched chain amino acids being deaminated in muscle. The provided documents don't directly address this specific topic. However, we can look for clues in the documents that might help answer the question. One document mentions amino acid nutrition of the fetal lamb, which is not directly related to the question. Another document talks about the correlation of blood and brain amino acids in hypoglycemic and normoglycemic rats, but it doesn't provide information on deamination of branched chain amino acids. The third document discusses proteinase activity on polysomes, which is not relevant to this question. The last document talks about nitrogen components of wine, including proteins, peptides, and amino acids, and their effect on the growth of lactic acid bacteria. However, it doesn't provide information on deamination of branched chain amino acids in muscle. Therefore, we can conclude that none of the provided documents directly address this specific topic.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
