["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about environmental conditions that increase the rate of transpiration from plants. The provided documents are mostly related to air pollution, pesticide concentration, and placenta development, which don't seem directly relevant to plant transpiration. However, one document mentions pollutant deposition from the air onto foliage as a cause of contamination. This could be indirectly related to plant physiology. Considering all available information, we can conclude that high relative humidity might increase the rate of transpiration from plants.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
