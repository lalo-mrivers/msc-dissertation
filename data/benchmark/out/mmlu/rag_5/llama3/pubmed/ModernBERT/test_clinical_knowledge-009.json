["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the transport of fatty acids into mitochondria. The documents provided do not directly mention the transportation of fatty acids. However, they do provide information on mitochondrial membranes and their interactions. From the document 'Contact sites between mitochondrial membranes: comments', we can infer that mitochondrial membranes are in close contact with each other, which suggests that there might be a mechanism to facilitate the transport of substances into or out of mitochondria. The document '[Regulation of mitochondrial membrane permeability by a factor from mitochondrial interaction]' provides information on the regulation of mitochondrial membrane permeability, but it does not specifically mention fatty acid transport.\n\nFrom this step-by-step thinking process, we can conclude that the answer choice related to carnitine is relevant, as it is known to be involved in the transport of long-chain fatty acids into mitochondria for beta-oxidation. Therefore, the answer choice D: carnitine seems the most plausible option.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
