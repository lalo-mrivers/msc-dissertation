["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the nature of new mutations. The provided documents mention Luria and Delbr√ºck's work on bacterial mutation rates, which implies that there are different types of mutations. Additionally, the paper on AeiB family study highlights the genetic transmission of a particular antigen, which suggests that mutations can be influenced by genetics. Furthermore, the case report on monosomy 10qter describes a new deletion, indicating that some mutations may result in changes to chromosome structure. Considering these points, it seems likely that most new mutations would be neutral or deleterious rather than beneficial.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
