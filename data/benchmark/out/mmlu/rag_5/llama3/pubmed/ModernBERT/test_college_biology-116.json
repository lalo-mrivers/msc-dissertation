["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the ability to detect differences in stimulus intensity. We need to find what aspect of brain function changes with the stimulus intensity. The provided documents discuss neural networks, impulses, and attention demands, but none of these directly relate to detecting differences in stimulus intensity. However, considering the context of a fixed neuronal circuit and the development of neurons, it is possible that the amplitude of action potentials or the number of action potentials per second might vary with the stimulus intensity. This could allow the brain to detect changes in the stimuli.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
