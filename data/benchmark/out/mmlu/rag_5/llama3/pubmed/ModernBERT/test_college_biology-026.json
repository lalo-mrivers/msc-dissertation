["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about brood parasites like cuckoos successfully tricking host birds into rearing their young. The genes that allow this to happen would remain in the gene pool because... We need to analyze the behaviors and responses of both the host bird species and the cuckoo. From the given documents, we can see that there is no intersexual cooperation during predator inspection behavior in guppies (Another battle of the sexes). Similarly, bank swallows are highly synchronized with each other, and reproductive fitness increases as a function of this precision (Adaptive significance of synchronized breeding). This suggests that both species may be driven by instinctive responses to certain cues. The question about host birds being duped into rearing cuckoo fledglings implies that the host bird's response is automatic or instinctual. Therefore, it is likely that the genes that allow this process would remain in the gene pool because... Cuckoos exploit the host bird's instinctive response to loud begging cues of a fledgling.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
