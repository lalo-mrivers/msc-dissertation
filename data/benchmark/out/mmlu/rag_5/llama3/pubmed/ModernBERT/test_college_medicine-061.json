["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about determining the Doppler shift in perceived sound frequency. The Doppler shift is caused by the change in frequency due to relative motion between the source and detector. To calculate this effect, we need to know the speed of sound in the medium (I). This is because the speed of sound affects how much the frequency changes as a result of the motion. In addition to the speed of sound, we also need to know the emitted sound frequency (IV) since this will be affected by the Doppler shift.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: I and IV\"\n}"]
