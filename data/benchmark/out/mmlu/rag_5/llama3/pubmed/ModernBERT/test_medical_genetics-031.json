["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the genotype frequency of heterozygotes assuming Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Since we are given the frequencies of two alleles (0.6 and 0.4), we can apply the Hardy-Weinberg formula to calculate the expected genotype frequency.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
