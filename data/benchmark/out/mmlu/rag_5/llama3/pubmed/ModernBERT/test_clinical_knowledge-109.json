["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the procedure to follow when a blood unit has been out of refrigeration for longer than the accepted time limit. The relevant documents provide information on blood storage and handling. The document 'Bacteriological sterility of washed deglycerolized red blood cells after 72 hours storage' suggests that reconstituted frozen red blood cells can be safely stored at 4Â°C for up to 72 hours. However, this does not provide guidance on what to do when a blood unit has been out of refrigeration for longer than the accepted time limit. The document 'Weekly rotation of blood inventory--a system for supplying small hospitals' mentions the importance of ensuring the return of unused blood at the end of the first week, but it does not provide information on what to do with a blood unit that has been out of refrigeration for longer than the accepted time limit. Therefore, we need to consider the document 'Chlorbutol toxicity and dependence', which is not directly related to blood storage or handling. The document 'Long-term stability of a cyanmethemoglobin reference standard' provides information on the long-term stability of a reference standard, but it does not provide guidance on what to do with a blood unit that has been out of refrigeration for longer than the accepted time limit. Therefore, we need to consider other factors and guidelines.\n\nThe document 'On fatal case acute ethyl alcohol poisoning (author's transl)' provides information on ethanol absorption and its effects on the body, but it does not provide guidance on what to do with a blood unit that has been out of refrigeration for longer than the accepted time limit. Therefore, we need to consider other factors and guidelines.\n\nThe relevant information is available from other sources such as standard operating procedures or medical guidelines. The answer should be based on these guidelines rather than the provided documents.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
