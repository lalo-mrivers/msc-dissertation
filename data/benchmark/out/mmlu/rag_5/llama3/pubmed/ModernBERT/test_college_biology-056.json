["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the effects of cytochalasin B on nerve outgrowth from a developing neuron. We know that microspikes of the growth cone extend and retract to move the growth cone forward. This process requires microfilaments, as they are involved in the extension and retraction of these microspikes. Exposure to cytochalasin B causes reversible depolymerization of actin filaments, which would disrupt this process.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
