["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the carpal bones of the wrist. The provided documents are case reports and anatomical studies that may or may not be relevant to this question. However, I will review each document for any mention of carpal bones. In the first document, there is no mention of carpal bones. The second document mentions muscles, but not carpal bones. The third document discusses eyelid pouches and has no relevance to the wrist. The fourth document presents a rare condition with 'lobster-claw' deformities of hands and feet, which does not involve the carpal bones. Therefore, I will rely on my general knowledge of anatomy to answer this question. There are eight carpal bones in the wrist, which are: scaphoid, lunate, triquetral, pisiform, trapezium, trapezoid, capitate, and hamate.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
