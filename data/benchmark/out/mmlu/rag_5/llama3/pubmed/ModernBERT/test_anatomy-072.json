["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"As we look at the provided documents, there is no mention of the spinal cord or motor neuron cell bodies. However, we do see mentions of nerve axons, neurons, and ganglia. Given that these documents are about different types of cells and tissues (retina, myocytes, nerve cell bodies), it's likely that we're looking for an answer related to the location of motor neuron cell bodies in the spinal cord. The only relevant information provided is the classification of nerve cell bodies in a previous document.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
