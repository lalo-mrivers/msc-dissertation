["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the descendants of plants with a double chromosome number. The relevant document is 'Chromosomal influence on hybrid cell proliferation' which states that when normal cells and cancer cells are fused, the resultant hybrid cells show loss of the tumorigenic phenotype. Similarly, in this case, the doubled chromosome number may allow for better pairing and segregation of chromosomes, making the plant reproductively successful. Therefore, option D seems the most plausible.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
