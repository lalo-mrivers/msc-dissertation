["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about characteristics typical of r-selected species. The relevant documents are about various medical and biological topics, but none of them specifically discuss r-selected species or their characteristics. Therefore, we need to consider the topic from a different perspective. In ecology, r-selected species are those that thrive in unstable environments with abundant resources. They typically have high reproductive rates to take advantage of these conditions. Small body size is not necessarily a characteristic of all r-selected species, but it can be an adaptation for efficient resource use. High competitive ability might be important for some r-selected species, but it's not a defining feature. Symmetrical shortening of both humeri (upper arms) is not relevant to the question.\n\nAfter considering these points, we can conclude that...\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
