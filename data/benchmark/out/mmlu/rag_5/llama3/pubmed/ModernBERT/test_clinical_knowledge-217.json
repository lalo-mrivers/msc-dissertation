["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"After reviewing the provided documents, it seems that none of them directly address endurance training or muscle capacity. However, I found a document discussing the significance of impulse activity in transforming skeletal muscle type. This could be related to muscle endurance. The document mentions experiments involving long-term electrical stimulation, which might be relevant to endurance training. Additionally, another document discusses eccentric training and stretching in tendon injuries, which is also related to muscle endurance. Based on this information, I will choose an answer from the provided options.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
