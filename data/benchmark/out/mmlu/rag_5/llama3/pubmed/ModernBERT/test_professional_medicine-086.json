["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the most likely diagnosis for a healthy 4-year-old girl with a grade 2/6 systolic ejection murmur along the upper left sternal border, widely split S2 that does not vary with respiration, and a soft mid-diastolic murmur along the lower left sternal border. Since there is no other abnormalities found during examination, we can rule out conditions like aortic stenosis or coarctation of the aorta which would likely have more significant findings. The widely split S2 suggests that the problem may be in the ventricle rather than the atrium. The presence of a soft mid-diastolic murmur suggests that the mitral valve is involved, but the finding does not strongly support mitral valve prolapse.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
