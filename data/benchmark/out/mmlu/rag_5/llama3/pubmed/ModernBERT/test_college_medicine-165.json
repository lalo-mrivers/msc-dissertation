["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the free energy contained in FADH2 and NADH+H. These molecules are involved in the process of cellular respiration. Specifically, FADH2 is a product of the citric acid cycle and NADH+H is produced during glycolysis. The electrons from these molecules are passed through a series of protein complexes called the electron transport chain, which generates a proton gradient across the mitochondrial membrane. This gradient is used to produce ATP.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
