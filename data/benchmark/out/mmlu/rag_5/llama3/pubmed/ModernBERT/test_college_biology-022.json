["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is comparing the wings of a bat and a butterfly. The key to understanding this question is to recognize that homologous structures are similar structures that share a common ancestor. Analogous structures are structures that have evolved independently but serve a similar function. Vestigial structures are remnants of structures that had a function in the past but no longer do. Dissimilar in form and function suggests that there is no similarity or shared function between the two wings.\n\nThe wings of a bat and a butterfly are very different in terms of their structure, function and evolutionary history. The wings of a bat are actually modified forelimbs used for flight, while those of a butterfly are delicate thin structures used for flying.\n\nSince the question asks about the similarity or dissimilarity between the two, we can eliminate homologous structures as they would require a common ancestor. We can also eliminate vestigial structures as there is no evidence that either the bat's or butterfly's wings had a function in the past but not now.\n\nThis leaves us with analogous and dissimilar in form and function. Although the wings of a bat and a butterfly have different structure, they both serve the function of flight. This suggests that analogous structures would be more likely. Therefore, we can conclude that the wings of a bat and a butterfly are analogous structures.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
