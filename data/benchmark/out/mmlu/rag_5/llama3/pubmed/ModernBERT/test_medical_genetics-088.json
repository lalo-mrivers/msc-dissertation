["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the presence of two or more cell lines from different zygotes in a single individual. The relevant documents describe cases where there are multiple cell lines present. For example, Unusual XX/XY chimerism describes twin boys with 'two populations, A1 and B, of cells' in their peripheral blood. Similarly, Incontinentia pigmenti describes a family where an increased number of chromosome breakages was found in the blood of affected as well as unaffected members. The presence of these multiple cell lines is described as chimerism or mosaicism. Therefore, the correct answer is likely related to one of these terms.\", \"answer_choice\": D}"]
