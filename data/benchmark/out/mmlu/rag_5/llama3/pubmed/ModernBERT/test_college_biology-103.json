["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the target of digestion of a nucleosome dimer to nucleosome monomers by DNase. Nucleosomes are made up of DNA wrapped around core histones (H2A, H2B, H3, and H4). The linker DNA region connects multiple nucleosomes together to form chromatin. Histone F3 is not directly related to the question. None of the provided documents mention Q beta replicase or oligo-histidine domains in relation to nucleosome digestion. Therefore, we can eliminate options A, C, and D. Only option B, histones H2A, H2B, H3, and H4, are relevant to the question.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
