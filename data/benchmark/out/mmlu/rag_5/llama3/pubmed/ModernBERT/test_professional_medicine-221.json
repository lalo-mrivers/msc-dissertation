["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has a 6-day history of fever, severe muscle pain, and diffuse, painful swelling of his neck, underarms, and groin area. He appears ill and lethargic and can barely answer questions. His temperature is 39.2°C (102.5°F), pulse is 120/min, respirations are 22/min, and blood pressure is 110/70 mm Hg. The patient's symptoms began after returning from a camping trip in New Mexico, where he may have been exposed to scorpions. Scorpion envenomation can cause multisystem manifestations, especially in young children. The patient's physical examination shows generalized scattered black maculae and a tender mass on the underside of his upper extremity just above the elbow, which is draining blood and necrotic material.\n\nThe most effective antibiotic for this patient's disorder will interfere with cellular processes or enzymes that are relevant to scorpion envenomation. Scorpion venom affects multiple systems, including the central nervous system and myocardium. The patient's symptoms suggest widespread inflammation and damage to tissues. Proteasomal degradation is a cellular process that is affected by scorpion venom.\n\nProteasomal degradation is the process by which cells break down damaged proteins and other biomolecules. In scorpion envenomation, proteasomal degradation is impaired, leading to accumulation of damaged proteins and contributing to tissue damage and inflammation. The most effective antibiotic for this patient's disorder will interfere with proteasomal degradation.\n\nThe options provided are: A: DNA helicase; B: Glucuronosyltransferase; C: Proteasomal degradation; D: Ribosomal assembly. Based on the patient's symptoms and possible exposure to scorpion venom, the correct answer is C: Proteasomal degradation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"]
