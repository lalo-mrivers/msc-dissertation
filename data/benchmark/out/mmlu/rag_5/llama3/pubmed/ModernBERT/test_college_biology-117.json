["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about why net primary productivity in terrestrial ecosystems tends to increase toward the tropics. The provided documents are not directly related to this topic, so we need to think step-by-step. We can look at general ecological principles and characteristics of tropical ecosystems. Net primary productivity is influenced by factors such as light availability, temperature, water availability, and species diversity. Tropical ecosystems receive more solar radiation due to their proximity to the equator, which would support higher photosynthetic rates. Additionally, warm temperatures and high humidity in the tropics can also foster photosynthesis.\", \"answer_choice\": C}"]
