["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about a scientist stimulating neurons in the hypothalamus and recording their membrane potential changes. She observes a sharp rise in membrane potential when she first stimulates them (depolarization), followed by no response to the second stimulation immediately after. However, when she increases the amount of voltage for the second shock, she observes a similar response to the first. This suggests that the neurons were initially driven into repetitive firing or plateau phase, and then the membrane potential returned to resting state. When she increased the stimulus again, it was strong enough to drive the neurons back into depolarization.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
