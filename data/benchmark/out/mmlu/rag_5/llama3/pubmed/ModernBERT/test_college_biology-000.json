["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about controlling mosquito population growth, which is a characteristic of logistic curves. The relevant document is 'The effective size of a natural Drosophila subobscura population.' The value mentioned in the document is approximately 400, which is likely referring to the carrying capacity (K) of the environment. Logistic curves describe how populations grow and eventually reach their carrying capacity. Therefore, it's possible that controlling mosquito population growth involves manipulating its carrying capacity or other factors affecting the logistic curve.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"]
