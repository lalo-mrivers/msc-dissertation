["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the interaction between DFP and ACE. We are given information about the binding of TX-100 to ACE, which leads to inhibition. This suggests that there may be a similar mechanism for the binding of DFP to ACE. The text also mentions that when DFP binds to ACE, the enzyme is rendered permanently inactive. This implies that the interaction between DFP and ACE is irreversible. Therefore, we can conclude that the interaction between DFP and ACE is best characterized as C: Irreversible inhibition.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
