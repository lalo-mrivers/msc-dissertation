["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"None of the provided documents discuss fatigue in high intensity exercise. However, I can analyze the relevant content. The first document discusses habituation to treadmill walking, which is not directly related to fatigue. The second document discusses transcendental meditation and adrenocortical activity, but it does not mention exercise or fatigue. The third document discusses hygienic evaluation of physical activity programs for schoolchildren, but it does not discuss high-intensity exercise or fatigue. The fourth document discusses the effect of standardized submaximal work load on intraocular pressure, which is also unrelated to high-intensity exercise and fatigue.\n\nConsidering these documents, I can infer that they do not provide information about the fundamental cause of fatigue in high intensity exercise. However, based on general knowledge, I can suggest that C: failure of the ATP supply to match the demand could be a possible answer.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
