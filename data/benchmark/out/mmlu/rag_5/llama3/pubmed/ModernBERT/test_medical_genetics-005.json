However, [Tracing quantitative measurements on human chromosomes in family studies] does touch on the topic of tracing quantitative measurements on human chromosomes from parents to offspring, which might be relevant. Therefore, I will carefully consider this document and its methods for tracing quantitative measurements. Ultimately, it seems that this method would require large numbers of DNA markers, which are not explicitly mentioned in the provided documents. However, it is possible that these types of markers could be used to facilitate mapping human chromosomes. Based on this thought process, I believe...\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
