["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The key to this question is understanding how the genetic information from both parents will combine to produce offspring. Since the woman has a single gene deletion, she can contribute either 0 or 2 alpha-globin genes to her offspring. The man with a two-gene deletion can only contribute 1 alpha-gene deletion. We need to consider the possible combinations of these genetic contributions and determine which ones will result in a two-gene deletion in the offspring. For this to happen, the offspring must inherit one deleted gene from each parent. This is possible when the mother contributes 0 alpha-globin genes (and therefore has only 1 gene left) and the father contributes 1 alpha-gene deletion. In this case, all offspring will have a two-gene deletion. Since the woman's contribution can be either 0 or 2 genes, the total percentage of offspring with a two-gene deletion is 50%.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
