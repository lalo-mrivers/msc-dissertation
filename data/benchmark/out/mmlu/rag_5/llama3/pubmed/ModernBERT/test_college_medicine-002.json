["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about a chemically based sensory system. The given options are Gustatory (taste), Auditory (hearing), and Olfactory (smell). Cystometry documents the use of fluid or gas for distending medium, which is not related to sensing chemicals. 'Knight Yvain's melancholia' and 'Crisis, psychology and tranquilizer use' are not relevant either. 'A key to the classification of cutaneous mechanoreceptors' might be related to sensing touch or pressure but does not mention chemicals. Therefore, considering the options, we can eliminate II (Auditory) and III (Olfactory) as they do not involve chemical sensing. This leaves us with I (Gustatory), which is indeed a chemically based sensory system, responsible for perceiving taste through chemical receptors in the tongue.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
