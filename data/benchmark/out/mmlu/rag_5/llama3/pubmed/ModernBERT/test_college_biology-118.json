["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about proteins moving along the plasma membrane of mouse-human cell fusion. The papers provided are about various cellular processes, but one paper stands out as being relevant to this topic: 'Electrondense cell inclusions of the human cone inner segments'. This paper describes organelles localized just outside the external limiting membrane, and only one or very few of them were present in each cell. This suggests a focus on cellular membranes. Additionally, the question mentions mouse cellsurface proteins and human cell-surface proteins integrating along a fused mouse-human cell plasma membrane. This is reminiscent of the phagokinetic tracks observed in 3T3 cells, which are related to cell movement and interactions. However, this paper does not directly address protein integration across membranes.\n\nThe paper that most likely employed the technique described in the question is 'Protein flux across the membrane of single secretion granules'. This paper describes the use of X-ray microscopy to measure the mass of protein contained in single sub-cellular membrane-bound structures and follow the flux of protein out of secretion (zymogen) granules. The results provide direct visual and quantitative confirmation of the hypothesis that the membrane enclosing this object is permeable to its various contained proteins, although the mechanism remains unknown.\n\nThis paper is most relevant to the question because it describes the movement of proteins across membranes in a manner similar to what would be observed if mouse cellsurface proteins and human cell-surface proteins were integrated along a fused mouse-human cell plasma membrane. Therefore, this technique was likely employed in order to yield these results.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
