["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the inheritance of sex characteristics. Sex is determined by the presence or absence of the Y chromosome. A single Y chromosome from either parent would be enough to make a child male, whereas the absence of the Y chromosome would result in a female. Therefore, it's not related to the number of X chromosomes from the mother (A), nor would a recessive allele on the X chromosome (B) affect the sex. Additionally, there is no such thing as a single Y chromosome from the mother (C). So, the correct answer must be D: a single Y chromosome from the father.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
