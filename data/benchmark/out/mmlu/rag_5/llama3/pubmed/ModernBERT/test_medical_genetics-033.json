["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The problem statement describes a cross between two true breeding lines with dark blue and bright white flowers. The F1 offspring have light blue flowers. When the F1 progeny are selfed, a 1:2:1 ratio of dark blue to light blue to white flowers is observed. This suggests that there is one major gene controlling flower color, which has three possible phenotypes. Inbreeding depression does not fit here as it would result in reduced fertility or viability, but the data shows no such effect.\n\nThe fact that each F1 progeny exhibits a different flower color (light blue) means that the dominant gene from one parent is not completely dominant over the recessive gene from the other parent. This suggests that incomplete dominance is a possibility.\n\nWhen the F1 progeny are selfed, a 1:2:1 ratio of dark blue to light blue to white flowers is observed. This suggests that there is one major gene controlling flower color, which has three possible phenotypes.\n\nThe only way this can occur is if the dominant allele from one parent is not completely dominant over the recessive allele from the other parent, and the recessive allele also produces a distinct phenotype (white flowers). This fits with incomplete dominance, where both alleles are expressed in the heterozygote.\n\nTherefore, it appears that the genetic phenomenon consistent with these results is incomplete dominance.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
