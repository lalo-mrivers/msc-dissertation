["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The key information provided is that the hormone is found both inside and out of cells when carrying out its function, increases the amount of nucleic acid in the cell while functioning, and is derived from a structure containing four hydroxycarbon rings. Based on this information, I can infer that the hormone has characteristics similar to steroids, which are known to be synthesized from cholesterol-containing structures (cholesterol being a molecule with four hydroxycarbon rings). Additionally, steroids are typically found both inside and outside cells and are involved in regulating gene expression by altering nucleic acid synthesis.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
