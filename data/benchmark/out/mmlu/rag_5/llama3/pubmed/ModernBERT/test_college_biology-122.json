["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the effect of low external pH on mitochondria isolated and placed in a buffered solution. From the provided documents, we can infer that mitochondria are capable of extruding acid (H+ ions) in an energy-requiring process to maintain their internal pH, as described in the document 'Active control of intracellular pH'. This process requires ATP. When the external pH is low, it would be logical for the mitochondria to work harder to maintain their internal pH by increasing ATP production.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
