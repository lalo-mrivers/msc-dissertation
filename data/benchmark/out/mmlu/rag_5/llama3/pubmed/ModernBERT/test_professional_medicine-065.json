["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 32-year-old woman in active labor with no previous complications except mild asthma. The fetal heart rate was initially reactive but then had a prolonged deceleration to 60/min after 10 minutes of pushing. The patient suddenly developed shortness of breath, cyanosis, and became unresponsive. This suggests that the prolonged deceleration is not just due to cord compression or maternal exhaustion, but rather indicates a more severe fetal distress. Furthermore, the sudden onset of bleeding from the nose, mouth, and intravenous sites supports this diagnosis.\n\nThe most likely diagnosis is amniotic fluid embolism (AFE) because it is a known complication of labor that can present with sudden maternal cardiovascular collapse, respiratory failure, and bleeding. The patient's history of mild asthma treated with inhaled bronchodilators does not suggest anaphylaxis or status asthmaticus as the cause of her symptoms.\n\nThe other options are less likely to explain the patient's symptoms. Intracerebral hemorrhage would typically present with a more gradual onset of symptoms and would not be associated with fetal distress or bleeding from multiple sites. Myocardial infarction is unlikely given the sudden onset of symptoms and the absence of any cardiac risk factors. The patient's history does not suggest that she has underlying pulmonary disease that would lead to respiratory failure due to status asthmaticus.\n\nTherefore, based on the patient's symptoms and clinical presentation, the most likely diagnosis is amniotic fluid embolism.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
