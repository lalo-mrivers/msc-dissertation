["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the first groups of animals to develop lung tissue adequate to support their respiratory requirements without the use of supplementary gas exchange organs. The provided documents discuss different topics such as membrane oxygenators, skin grafts, ventricular-aortic blood pumps, and extreme environments. However, none of these documents directly address the development of lung tissue in animals. To find an answer, we need to look at the evolution of respiratory systems in animals. According to the document 'Oxygen transport in extreme environments', different strategies have evolved in organisms living in extreme polar environments (mammals and fish) to solve the problem of transporting oxygen to respiring tissues. This implies that these organisms developed lung tissue adequate to support their respiratory requirements without supplementary gas exchange organs. Therefore, we can conclude that mammals are the first groups of animals to develop lung tissue adequate for their respiratory needs.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
