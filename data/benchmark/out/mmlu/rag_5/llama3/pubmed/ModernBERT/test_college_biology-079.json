["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the cross between a tall violet plant (DDWw) and a dwarf white plant. Since D is dominant to d and W is dominant to w, we can start by determining the possible genotypes of the offspring. The DDWw parent has two copies of the dominant allele for height (D), so all offspring from this parent will also have the genotype DW or DD. Similarly, the DW parent has one copy each of the recessive and dominant alleles for flower color (w and W), respectively, so all offspring from this parent will have the genotype wW or ww.\n\nThe possible genotypes of the offspring are thus: DDWw, DwWw, Ddw, ddww. Since D is dominant to d, we know that any plant with a genotype containing one or two copies of D (DD or DW) will be tall. Similarly, since W is dominant to w, we know that any plant with a genotype containing one or two copies of W (WW or Ww) will have violet flowers.\n\nThis means that the possible phenotypes are: tall violet (DDWw), tall white (Dww), dwarf violet (dDWw), and dwarf white (ddww). To determine the expected phenotypic ratio, we can count the number of offspring with each phenotype:\n\n* Tall violet: 2\n* Tall white: 2\n* Dwarf violet: 1\n* Dwarf white: 1\n\nThe expected phenotypic ratio is therefore: 3:1\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
