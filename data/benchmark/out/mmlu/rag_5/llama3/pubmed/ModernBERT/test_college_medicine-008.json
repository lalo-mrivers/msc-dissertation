["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"This question is asking about the process of translation. Translation requires the production of proteins from genetic information encoded in DNA. The first step is transcription, where the information in DNA is copied into RNA. Then, during translation, the RNA sequence is read and amino acids are added to form a protein. Since RNA polymerase is involved in transcription, not translation, it's not needed for the process. Ribosomes are involved in translation, as they read the mRNA sequence and assemble the amino acids into proteins. Therefore, we're left with DNA, mRNA and ribosomes. This matches option C.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"]
