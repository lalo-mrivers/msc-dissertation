["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Insulin is shown to directly enhance both the rate of transport and the uptake of creatine in vitro in isolated rat skeletal muscle. This action of the hormone on creatine transport is similar to that reported for the transport of some amino acids and sugars. Therefore, it can be inferred that insulin promotes glucose and amino acid uptake by muscle.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
