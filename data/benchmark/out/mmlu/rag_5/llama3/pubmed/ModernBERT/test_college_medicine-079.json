["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The β-oxidation of a molecule of palmitic acid involves the sequential breakdown of the fatty acid into smaller units. The reaction occurs in the mitochondria and requires oxygen. It is a cyclic process that generates acetyl-CoA, ATP, and NADH. Since palmitic acid has 16 carbon atoms, it will undergo 7 cycles of β-oxidation to produce the final products.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
