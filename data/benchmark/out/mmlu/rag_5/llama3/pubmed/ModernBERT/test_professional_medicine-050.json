["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has atrial fibrillation with a rapid heart rate. He was given metoprolol initially to slow down the pulse, but it increased again after 2 hours. The goal is to decrease his pulse further. Considering the patient's history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and the initial response to metoprolol, we should look for medications that can help in rate control. Digoxin is not mentioned as an option, so let's focus on the other choices. Enalapril is a vasodilator and has no direct effect on heart rate, making it unlikely to be effective in this scenario. Lidocaine is mentioned in one of the case reports as causing bradycardia, but it was used to treat severe bradycardia. In this patient's case, we want to decrease the pulse, not cause bradycardia. Therefore, lidocaine is unlikely to be the correct answer. The patient has already received metoprolol and responded by having a slower heart rate initially, but then it increased again. Since metoprolol is still an option, let's consider whether it could be used again. Given its initial effectiveness in slowing down the pulse, it might be reasonable to try it again.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
