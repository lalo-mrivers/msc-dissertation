["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"DNA polymerase adds complementary nucleotides to a template strand. The ratio of A:T bases on the template strand is 3:2. Since DNA polymerase matches A with T and G with C, the new strand will have the same ratio but in reverse (T:A and C:G). Therefore, the ratio of A:T in the newly synthesized complementary strand is also 3:2.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
