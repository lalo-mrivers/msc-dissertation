["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking which molecule does not form part of DNA. The answer must be one that is not a component of the DNA molecule. DNA is composed of nucleotides, each consisting of a sugar molecule called deoxyribose, a phosphate group, and one of four nitrogenous bases: adenine (A), guanine (G), cytosine (C), or thymine (T). Therefore, we can eliminate C: Deoxyribose as it is a component of DNA. The remaining options are all components of amino acids, but not DNA. Hence, the correct answer is D: Amino acid.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
