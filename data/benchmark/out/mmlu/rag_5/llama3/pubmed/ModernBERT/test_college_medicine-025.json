["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The given DNA sequence is 5' - GGATCCTCATG - 3'. To determine the result of a point mutation and deletion, I will analyze each part separately. The point mutation could be a change in one or more nucleotides. Considering the options, I see that option A has a 'G' replaced with a 'G', which doesn't seem to fit. Option B has a completely different sequence, so it's unlikely. Option C also has a changed 'AT' sequence, which is not what we're looking for. Option D has an 'A' deleted from the original sequence, which could be the result of a point mutation and deletion.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
