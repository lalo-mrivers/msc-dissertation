["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the energy released from the breakdown of high-energy phosphates. We can look at the relevant documents for information on ATP hydrolysis. In 'Determination of cytosolic ADP and AMP concentrations and the free energy of ATP hydrolysis in human muscle and brain tissues with 31P NMR spectroscopy', we find that the free energy for ATP hydrolysis was calculated. This doesn't directly answer our question, but it gives us an idea of the timeframe involved in ATP breakdown. In 'Stimulation of replanted extremity muscles and its effect on energy processes', we see that medicamental stimulation increased the level of creatine-phosphoric acid and ATP. This suggests that ATP is being broken down to release energy. However, there's no direct information on how long this process can sustain maximal exertion exercise. In 'Effect of short-term microcirculatory disorders on indices of myocardial energy metabolism', we see that disturbance of the microcirculation produced by high molecular weight dextran and vasopressin led to intensification of glycolysis, indicating an increase in energy breakdown from ATP. Again, there's no direct information on how long this process can sustain maximal exertion exercise. Based on these documents, it seems that the energy released from the breakdown of high-energy phosphates can sustain exertion for a relatively short period.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
