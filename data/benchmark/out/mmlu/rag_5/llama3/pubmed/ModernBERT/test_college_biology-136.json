["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The key to this question is understanding the concept of linked genes. Linked genes are those that are physically located on the same chromosome and tend to be inherited together more frequently than expected by chance. In this case, we have a female fruit fly with gray body and normal wings (phenotype), which means she must carry two copies of one allele (gray) and two copies of another allele (normal). The male has black body and vestigial wings, which means he also carries two alleles for each trait. When they mate, their offspring can inherit different combinations of these alleles. Since the gray and normal genes are linked, we would expect to see a higher frequency of flies with gray bodies and normal wings than if the genes were not linked. This is because the gray gene is more likely to be inherited along with the normal gene, as they are on the same chromosome.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
