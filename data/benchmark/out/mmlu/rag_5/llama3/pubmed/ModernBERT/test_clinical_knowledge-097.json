["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about peripheral muscle fatigue during multiple sprint activities. The relevant documents are about muscle adaptation, athlete's heart, tennis injuries, gait disturbances, and oral appliances. However, none of these documents directly address the topic of muscle fatigue. Therefore, we need to look for clues that might be related to muscle fatigue.\n\nThe closest document is 'Significance of impulse activity in the transformation of skeletal muscle type', which talks about changes in skeletal muscle in response to different functional requirements. This could potentially relate to muscle fatigue during multiple sprint activities.\n\nOne possible factor contributing to peripheral muscle fatigue during multiple sprint activities is an accumulation of inorganic phosphate (A). Inorganic phosphate can accumulate as a result of increased energy expenditure and reduced ATP production, leading to fatigue.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
