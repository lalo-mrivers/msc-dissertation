["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for the rate of energy expenditure based on the mean rate of oxygen consumption. From the provided documents, we can see that the caloric cost of running in trained runners was 0.97 Kcal/kg/min. Since we are given the mean rate of oxygen consumption (2 L/min) and need to find the rate of energy expenditure, we can use this value to make an estimate. Assuming a constant volume of oxygen per unit of energy expenditure, we can convert the rate of oxygen consumption from liters per minute to milliliters per minute (1 liter is approximately equal to 1000 milliliters). This would give us the rate of oxygen consumption in milliliters per minute as 2000 ml/min. Finally, we can use this value and the caloric cost of running in trained runners to estimate the rate of energy expenditure.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B\n}"]
