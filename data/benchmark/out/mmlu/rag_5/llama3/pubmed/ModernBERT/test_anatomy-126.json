["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the cranial nerve related to the sense of smell. Upon reviewing the relevant documents, I notice that [Information processing in mammalian gustatory systems] discusses the taste system and its multiple functions carried by three cranial nerves. It emphasizes the likely existence of coding channels activated by specific sets of receptors. This information does not directly relate to the question about the sense of smell. [Physiology of taste] also discusses the role of the tongue in discriminating between basic tastes, but it does not provide any information about the sense of smell. The other documents do not seem relevant to this question. Therefore, I will focus on the cranial nerves mentioned in the question. Among the options provided (A: Abducens, B: Hypoglossal, C: Olfactory, D: Trochlear), the one that is most likely related to the sense of smell is... \", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"]
