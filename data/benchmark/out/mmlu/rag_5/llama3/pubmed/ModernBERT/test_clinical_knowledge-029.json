["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"This question is asking about the movement of lactate and hydrogen ions out of muscle tissue. From the provided documents, none of them explicitly discuss lactate and hydrogen ion transport in muscle. However, considering the content of each document, it's more likely to be related to acid-base balance or metabolism. The only mention of lactate is in [The effect of ADP on platelet metabolism in vitro.-III-], but it's not relevant to this question.\n\nIn contrast, [Ventilation and blood-gas studies during experimentally produced Mendelson's syndrome in the dog.] discusses respiratory acidosis, which is related to hydrogen ions. However, there's no direct mention of lactate transport.\n\nBased on the available information, simple diffusion (D) seems the most plausible mechanism for lactate and hydrogen ion movement out of muscle, as it doesn't require energy or specific transport proteins.\", \"answer_choice\": D}"]
