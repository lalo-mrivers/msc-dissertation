["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is 19 weeks pregnant and the karyotype shows that the fetus is XY. Since the father had classic hemophilia, which is an X-linked recessive condition, we need to consider the probability of inheritance. The mother (patient) being a carrier or having hemophilia herself would have affected the inheritance pattern. However, since the patient is not mentioned to be a carrier or having hemophilia, we can assume she is not affected and is simply passing on her X chromosome to the fetus. Therefore, the fetus has a 50% chance of inheriting the father's mutation if it were an X-linked recessive condition like hemophilia.\", \"answer_choice\": B}"]
