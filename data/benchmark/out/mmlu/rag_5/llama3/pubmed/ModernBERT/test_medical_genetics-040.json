["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about severe anaemia at birth. The relevant documents describe various conditions, but one condition that stands out is Haemoglobin Miwate, which is mentioned as causing cyanosis since birth. This suggests that the haemoglobin variant might be related to anaemia. A quick scan of the options reveals that option B: Beta-thalassaemia does not match the description. Option D: Sickle cell disease also does not seem relevant. Alpha-thalassaemia could potentially cause anaemia, but the description of Haemoglobin Miwate seems more specific. The only remaining option is C: Hereditary persistence of fetal haemoglobin, which does not seem to fit with the description of severe anaemia at birth.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"]
