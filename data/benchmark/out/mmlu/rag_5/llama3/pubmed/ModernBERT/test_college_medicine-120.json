["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about blood lactate concentration in soccer games. There are no relevant documents provided that directly address this topic. However, I can look for indirect clues or analogies from the given documents. The document 'Investigations concerning the body fluid homeostasis' mentions changes in blood density and transcapillary fluid shift phenomena. This suggests that changes in blood composition can occur during physical activity. The document 'Use of subnarcotic concentrations of methoxyflurane in children with burns' describes a test for determining changes in blood sugar levels after operations, which is relevant to the topic of metabolic changes during exercise. There is no direct mention of lactate concentration in these documents. However, I can infer that increased energy expenditure during physical activity leads to an increase in anaerobic metabolism and subsequent accumulation of lactic acid in the blood. This suggests that the blood lactate concentration may increase throughout the course of the game as the players become more fatigued.\n\nThe document 'Cellular basis for the T wave of the electrocardiogram' discusses action potential duration and Na+-K+ exchange pump, which is not directly relevant to this topic. The document 'Hypothermic prostatic resection' describes a method to reduce blood loss during surgery, which is also unrelated to blood lactate concentration.\n\nBased on these indirect clues and analogies, I can conclude that the blood lactate concentration increases throughout the course of the game as the players become more fatigued.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
