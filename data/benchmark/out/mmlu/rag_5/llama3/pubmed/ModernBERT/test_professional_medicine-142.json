["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"No relevant documents discuss cholecystectomy or post-operative nutritional support. However, one document describes a patient with severe headache after ingesting phenylpropanolamine (Trimolets) tablet, and another document discusses renovascular hypertension in the context of Takayasu's disease. Neither of these documents provides information on nutritional support.\n\nThe other two documents describe rare medical conditions: chronic fascioliasis with destructive cholangitis and thrombosis of the suprahepatic veins (Budd-Chiari syndrome). Again, neither of these documents provides relevant information for this question.\n\nTherefore, we must look at the patient's condition: nausea and vomiting after cholecystectomy for protracted ileus, unable to eat 6 days after surgery. This suggests that the patient is experiencing a prolonged post-operative ileus or intestinal obstruction, which may be related to the initial cholelithiasis.\n\nConsidering this scenario, feeding through a nasogastric feeding tube (B) would be the most appropriate form of nutritional support.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
