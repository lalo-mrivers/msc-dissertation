["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To solve this problem, we need to first find the initial velocity of the car. Since it's already on the track, its initial velocity is 0 m/s. We know that the distance of the track is 50m and the final velocity required to jump the buses is 130 km/h (approximately 36.6 m/s). We can use the equation v^2 = u^2 + 2as to solve for acceleration, where u is initial velocity, v is final velocity, a is acceleration, and s is distance. Plugging in the values, we get: 366^2 = 0^2 + 2a(50). Simplifying, we get 133,200 = 100a. Dividing both sides by 100, we get a = 1332/10 = 133 m/s^2. Since acceleration is measured in meters per second squared, not kilometers, we need to convert the distance from kilometers to meters (50 km * 1000m/km = 50,000m). Plugging this value into our equation and simplifying, we get a = 36.6^2 / 50000 = 26 m/s^2.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
