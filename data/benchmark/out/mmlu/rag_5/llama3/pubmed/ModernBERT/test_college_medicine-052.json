["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Firstly, we need to determine the maximum oxygen consumption among female textile workers. According to the document '[Determination of the optimum of physical loading in relation to the maximum potentialities of the body]', the maximum oxygen consumption among female textile workers ranges between 2.2 l/min and 1.6 l/min. Since this is for female textile workers, we cannot directly apply it to an athlete. However, we can use the given value of 3.0 l/min as the average steady-rate oxygen uptake for our calculation. Next, we need to determine the energy expenditure per unit of oxygen consumption. According to the document '[Physiologic energy requirements of miners working in deep coal mines]', the mean daily energy requirement of a 'standard' miner (body mass-70 kg, age-25-35 years) comprises 16529.7 kJ under conditions of fulfillment of the standard output, 6-hour working day, 2 days off. We are not provided with the exact energy expenditure per unit of oxygen consumption for miners. However, we can use this value as an approximation. Finally, we need to calculate the total energy expenditure based on the athlete's steady-rate oxygen uptake and exercise duration. The formula used is: Energy Expenditure = Oxygen Uptake x Exercise Duration x Energy Expenditure per Unit of Oxygen Consumption.\", \"answer_choice\": C}"]
