["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about inducing polyploidy in a dividing eukaryote. Since the provided documents don't mention polyploidy specifically, we need to focus on cell division or growth inhibition. The relevant information comes from 'Inhibition of yeast sporulation by ethidium bromide.' This document shows that ethidium bromide blocks ascus formation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which might mean the presence of the mitochondrial genome is required for sporulation.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
