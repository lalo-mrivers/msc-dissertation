["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 14-year-old boy who has developed breasts during the past year. Physical examination shows bilateral fibroglandular masses beneath the nipple-areolar complex and normal penis and testes. Pubic hair development is Tanner stage 3, which suggests that puberty is progressing normally. Serum concentrations of gonadotropic hormones, estrogens, and testosterone are within reference ranges, which rules out hyperestrogenism or hypogonadism as causes of breast enlargement. The patient's reluctance to remove his shirt for the examination also suggests that he may be experiencing gender dysphoria, which is consistent with a diagnosis of Kallmann's syndrome.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"]
