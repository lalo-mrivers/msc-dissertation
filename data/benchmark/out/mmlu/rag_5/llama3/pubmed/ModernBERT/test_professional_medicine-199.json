["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 70-year-old woman with a worsening tremor of her hands. She has been taking fluoxetine for the past 3 weeks to cope with the death of her husband. The patient's medical history includes essential hypertension and hyperlipidemia, which are controlled with medications. She also drinks one glass of wine daily because it reduces her tremor. Based on this information, we can rule out Parkinson's disease as a cause of the worsening tremor since it is unlikely to occur at this age.\n\nThe patient's symptoms suggest that the worsening tremor may be related to her medication or her bereavement reaction. Fluoxetine is known to cause tremors in some patients, especially if they are taking other medications that can exacerbate this side effect. The patient's history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia suggests that she may be sensitive to certain medications.\n\nOn the other hand, the patient's bereavement reaction could also contribute to her worsening tremor. Grief reactions can cause a range of physical symptoms, including tremors, and it is possible that the patient's increasing stress and anxiety are contributing to her symptoms.\n\nBased on this information, the most likely cause of the patient's worsening tremor is an adverse effect of fluoxetine therapy or her bereavement reaction.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A: Adverse effect of fluoxetine therapy\""]
