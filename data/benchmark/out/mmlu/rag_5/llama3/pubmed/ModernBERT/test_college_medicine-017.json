["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The new enzyme participates in synthesis of an unknown product using two reactants. It switches a nitrogen group on one reactant to the other reactant. This suggests that the enzyme is involved in transferring a functional group or modifying the structure of one molecule into another. The description does not involve oxidation, hydrolysis, or cleaving bonds, which eliminates options A, C, and D. Therefore, the new enzyme would fall under option B: Transferase.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
