["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, we need to find the maximum oxygen consumption among female textile workers. According to the document [Determination of the optimum of physical loading in relation to the maximum potentialities of the body], this ranges between 2.2 l/min and 1.6 l/min. Since this is for female textile workers and not athletes, we need to look at another document. In [Physiologic energy requirements of miners working in deep coal mines], we find that mean daily energy requirement of a 'standard' miner (body mass--70 kg, age--25-35 years) comprises 16529.7 kJ (3950.7 kcal) under conditions of fulfillment of the standard output. We don't have the exact information about the athlete's maximum oxygen consumption, but we can use this value as a rough estimate. Then, we need to calculate the energy expenditure for 5 minutes of exercise. According to [Determination of the optimum of physical loading in relation to the maximum potentialities of the body], the allowable physical exertion among female textile workers should not exceed 3.5 kcal/min. Since this is for female textile workers and not athletes, we can't directly apply this value. However, we know that the athlete's steady-rate oxygen uptake averages 3.0 l/min, which is higher than the maximum oxygen consumption of female textile workers. Therefore, we can assume that the energy expenditure per minute is higher than 3.5 kcal/min. We also know that 1 liter of O2 corresponds to approximately 21 kJ. For 5 minutes of exercise, the total energy expenditure would be: (3.0 l/min) x (5 min) x (21 kJ/l) = 315 kJ. However, this is an overestimation since we don't know the exact energy expenditure per minute for athletes. Therefore, we'll round down to a lower value.\", \"answer_choice\": C}"]
