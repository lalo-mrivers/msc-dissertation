["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The situation described is that a pilot cannot see the light at 1 mile away. This means the pilot did not detect the light's presence when it was actually there (signal detection theory term: 'Hit' is when a stimulus is present and detected). On the other hand, the pilot would have incorrectly reported seeing the light if it were absent (False alarm). Since the pilot cannot see the light at 1 mile away, this scenario corresponds to not detecting the signal (Miss).\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
