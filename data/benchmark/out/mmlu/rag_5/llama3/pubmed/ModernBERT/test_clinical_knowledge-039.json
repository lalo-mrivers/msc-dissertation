["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks to find the rate of energy expenditure given the mean rate of oxygen consumption. From the provided documents, we can see that the caloric cost of running is 0.97 Kcal/kg/km. The problem doesn't specify a distance or time, but it gives the oxygen consumption in liters per minute. We need to find the equivalent caloric cost. Using the first document, we know that the oxygen consumption--running speed relationship was highly significant and linear over the entire aerobic range. This means we can find the equivalent caloric cost by finding the oxygen consumption from the given value (2 l/min) and then multiplying it with the caloric cost per unit distance and time. From the second document, we know that VO2 max increases with age, but it's not directly related to the rate of oxygen consumption during a training session. The third document talks about the relationship between total energy cost and cardiac effort for a set of graded calisthenics, which is not relevant here. Finally, the fourth document presents a simple relation between performance in running and maximal aerobic power, but it doesn't provide any information that can be directly applied to this problem.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
