["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the provided documents, it is clear that both non-competitive inhibition and uncompetitive inhibition are types of allosteric regulation. Non-competitive inhibitors bind to an allosteric site on the enzyme and prevent it from catalyzing a reaction, whereas uncompetitive inhibitors bind to the enzyme-substrate complex and prevent catalysis. Therefore, increasing substrate concentration would not have any direct effect on non-competitive inhibition.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: No effect\"\n}"]
