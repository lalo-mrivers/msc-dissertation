["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The provided documents do not mention green unicellular algae or cyanobacteria. However, the concept of chloroplasts is discussed in the first document 'Cladistic methods and chromophyte phylogeny.' Chloroplasts are organelles found in plant-like organisms such as algae. The text does not explicitly compare cyanobacteria to green unicellular algae, but it discusses the origin of chloroplasts among pigmented chromophytes. Since cyanobacteria also have chloroplasts, one can infer that they may have evolved from a common ancestor with these pigmented chromophytes.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
