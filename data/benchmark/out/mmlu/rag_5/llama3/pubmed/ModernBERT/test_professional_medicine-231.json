["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has a systolic heart murmur over the precordium, which suggests that she may have endocarditis. Endocarditis is an infection of the heart valves, often caused by bacterial or fungal pathogens. The patient's history of intravenous drug use increases her risk for endocarditis. A systolic heart murmur can be a sign of tricuspid regurgitation, which is a common complication of tricuspid valve endocarditis. As a result, the expected physical finding would be an increased intensity of the murmur with forced expiration, as this would further increase right ventricular pressure and worsen tricuspid regurgitation.\", \"answer_choice\": C}"]
