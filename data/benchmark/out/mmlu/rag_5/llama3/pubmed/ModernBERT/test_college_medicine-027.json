["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, we need to consider the forces acting on the object. There is the force due to gravity (mg) and the normal force (N) between the object and the plane. Since the object is resting on the plane, the net force must be zero. This means that mg sin(?) = N. The coefficient of friction (µ) plays a crucial role in determining the value of N. As the angle of incline increases, the normal force decreases until it reaches a point where the object starts to slide. At this point, the kinetic frictional force (f_k) equals the weight component parallel to the plane (mg sin(?)). We can now write an equation for the acceleration of the object: a = g (cos(?) - µ sin(?))\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
