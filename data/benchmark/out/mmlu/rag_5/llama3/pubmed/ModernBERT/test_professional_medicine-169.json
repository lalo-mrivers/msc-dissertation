["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Given that a point mutation in the p53 gene (TP53) leads to an inactive gene product, we can infer that the cell cycle arrest mechanism is disrupted. Prolonged G2 phase of breast cancer cells and chromosome damage suggest that p53 plays a role in regulating the cell cycle, particularly in the G2 phase. Therefore, it's likely that the progressive tumor growth despite irradiation therapy is related to a defect in cell cycle arrest in the G2 phase.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C\n}"]
