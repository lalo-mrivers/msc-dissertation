["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the type of covalent bonds that link amino acids in a protein. The provided documents are related to various aspects of proteins, but they don't provide direct information on this specific topic. However, we can use our knowledge and inference from the given texts to answer this question. From the document 'A stereochemical relationship could explain the origin of the genetic code', we know that aminoacyl-RNA formation is discussed as a possible mechanism for tRNA ancestors. This implies that amino acids are linked together in some way, possibly through covalent bonds. The document 'Prediction of chain turns in globular proteins on a hydrophobic basis' also mentions peptide chains and backbone changes, which further supports the idea of covalent bonding between amino acids. Finally, the document 'The alpha-helix dipole and the properties of proteins' discusses phosphate moieties binding to helices, which doesn't directly relate to covalent bonds between amino acids but adds context about protein structures. Based on these inferences, it is likely that peptide bonds link amino acids in a protein.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
