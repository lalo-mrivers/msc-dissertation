["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents are about kinetic analysis of enzyme experiments, metabolic rate estimation, structure-activity correlations for acaricidal hydrazones, temperature dependence of biological processes, and autoanalysis of cellular beta-glucuronidase activity. None of these topics are related to glycolysis or the rate limiting enzymes involved in it. Therefore, we need to look outside these documents for information about glycolysis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
