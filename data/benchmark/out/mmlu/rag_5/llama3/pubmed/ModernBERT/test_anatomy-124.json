["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the location where parasympathetic preganglionic axons leave the central nervous system (CNS). The answer can be found by reviewing relevant anatomical information. In the context of autonomic nervous system, preganglionic fibers are responsible for transmitting signals to ganglia before being transmitted further to peripheral organs. Parasympathetic preganglionic axons originate from the brainstem and spinal cord. By considering the specific nerves that emerge from the CNS, it becomes clear that parasympathetic preganglionic axons leave the CNS with...\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
