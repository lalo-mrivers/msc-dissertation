["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question describes a mistake that has occurred during DNA replication. The mistake is on the leading strand, which means it's likely an error that was introduced during synthesis rather than repair. Since the incorrect base is removed shortly after the RNA primer is removed, this suggests that the mechanism responsible for proofreading and correcting errors is acting immediately after DNA synthesis. This points towards a role for DNA polymerase I, as it has been shown to be involved in the correction of errors made during DNA synthesis.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
