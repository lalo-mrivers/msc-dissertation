["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the largest active pool of carbon that contributes the most to carbon cycling. From the given documents, it can be inferred that the pre-biotic atmosphere was heavily reducing and there is no mention of recoverable fossil fuels being an active pool of carbon. The oceans are mentioned as a potential sink for oxygen, but not as an active pool of carbon. Rain-forest vegetation is also not relevant to this question.\n\nThe document 'A comment on methanogenic bacteria and the primitive ecology' suggests that methane-producing bacteria played a significant role in determining the balance between CO2 and CH4 in the primitive atmosphere. This implies that there was a large flux of carbon being cycled through these microorganisms, which are present in the oceans and other aquatic environments.\n\nTherefore, it can be concluded that the largest active pool of carbon that contributes the most to carbon cycling is the oceans.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
