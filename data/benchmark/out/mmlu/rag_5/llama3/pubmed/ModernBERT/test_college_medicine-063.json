["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Both meiosis and mitosis are types of cell division. Meiosis is a process that occurs in the reproductive cells (gametes) to produce gametes with half the number of chromosomes as the parent cell. Mitosis, on the other hand, is a process that occurs in non-reproductive cells to produce two daughter cells that are genetically identical to the parent cell. Both processes share some common phases.\\r\\n\\r\\nLooking at the relevant documents, we can see that mitosis has G1, S and G2 phases (although not explicitly mentioned in the provided documents). Meiosis also goes through similar phases: prophase I, metaphase I, anaphase I, telophase I, interkinesis, prophase II, metaphase II, anaphase II, and telophase II.\\r\\n\\r\\nComparing these phases, we can see that G2 phase is common to both meiosis and mitosis. S phase is also present in both processes.\\r\\n\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"]
