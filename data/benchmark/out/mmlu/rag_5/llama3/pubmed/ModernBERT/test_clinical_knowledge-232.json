["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the main fate of lactate that leaves muscle and enters the circulation. The provided documents don't directly address this topic. However, we can think step-by-step: lactate is a product of anaerobic glycolysis in muscles. It's not related to ATP depletion, which was discussed in one of the documents. Nor is it related to placental iron transport or permeability of thymocyte plasma membranes for calcium ions. We can also rule out conversion to urea in the liver because that would require an energy-requiring process, and our previous step ruled out that connection.\n\nThe remaining option is uptake and oxidation by other tissues. This makes sense because lactate is a readily available substrate for glycolysis in many tissues.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
