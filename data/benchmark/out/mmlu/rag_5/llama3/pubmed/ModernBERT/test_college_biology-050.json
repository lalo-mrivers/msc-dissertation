["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about chemosynthetic bacteria's ability to produce their own food without photon-absorbing pigments. The provided documents reveal that some bacteria are capable of synthesizing organic acids (propionic, acetic, and pyruvic) in a flow system using glucose, lactate-Na, or whey lactose as carbon sources. Additionally, other bacteria can oxidize aromatic hydrocarbons with the formation of cis dihydrodiols. Hydrogen bacteria were also studied for their ability to accumulate proteins, carbohydrates, lipids, organic and amino acids in the medium during multiple reutilization. Photochemical dehydrogenation of 5,6-dihydropyrimidines is another process that involves energy production. From this information, it can be inferred that chemosynthetic bacteria derive energy by oxidizing inorganic substances such as ammonia, sulfur, or hydrogen.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
