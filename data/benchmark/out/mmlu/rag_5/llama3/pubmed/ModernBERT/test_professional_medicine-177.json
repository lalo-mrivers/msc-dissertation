["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about a 15-year-old male with painful swelling over the sacral prominence following a fall during a high school wrestling match. The patient has a low-grade fever and an erythematous, fluctuant, elevated mass with midline pores. Rectal examination reveals no induration or pain. Considering the history of trauma, the location of the lesion, and the symptoms, I think it is unlikely to be a tumor or cyst. The presence of midline pores suggests a pilonidal abscess, which can be caused by friction and trauma. Therefore, I believe the most likely diagnosis is a pilonidal abscess.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
