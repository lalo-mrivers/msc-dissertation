["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the composition of codons. Codons are a fundamental concept in molecular biology and refer to the sequences of nucleotide bases that code for amino acids or proteins. After reviewing the provided documents, I did not find any information specifically related to codons or their composition. However, one document mentions mRNA (message RNA) which is a type of RNA that carries genetic information from DNA to the ribosome during protein synthesis. This implies that nucleotide bases are involved in coding for amino acids, but no specific information about codon length is provided. Based on this analysis, I will assume that codons refer to triplet sequences of nucleotide bases.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
