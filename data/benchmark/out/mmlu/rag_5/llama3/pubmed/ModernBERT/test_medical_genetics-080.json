["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about diagnostic techniques for neural tube defects. The relevant documents discuss neural tube defects in the context of antenatal diagnosis. Therefore, we can focus on the diagnostic techniques mentioned in these documents. Amniocentesis and Chorion villus sampling (CVS) are mentioned as methods for antenatal diagnosis of neural tube defects. Maternal serum screening is also discussed as a method for antenatal diagnosis. Ultrasonography is not specifically mentioned in the context of diagnosing neural tube defects. Therefore, we can infer that ultrasonography might be used to diagnose other conditions, but its value in diagnosing neural tube defects is uncertain.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
