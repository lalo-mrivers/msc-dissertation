["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"I am looking for information about muscle fibers. I have the documents on Sound-field hearing tests, The constricted (cup and lop) ear, Method of investigation of deviations from the normal duration of the cardiac cycle, Fractures of the humerus from arm wrestling, and Equipment and methods for simple sensory testing. Since none of these documents seem to be relevant to muscle fibers, I will need to rely on my general medical knowledge. Muscle fibers are classified based on their metabolic properties and contraction speed. Type I muscle fibers are known as slow-twitch fibers, which means they are used for low-intensity activities that require endurance. They are also glycolytic, meaning they use anaerobic metabolism to generate energy. Given this information, I am going to look at the options and see if any of them match these characteristics.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
