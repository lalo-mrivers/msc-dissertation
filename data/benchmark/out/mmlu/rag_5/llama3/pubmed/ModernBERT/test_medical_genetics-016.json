["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for the frequency of AABBCC individuals from a mating of two AaBbCc individuals. To solve this, we need to determine the possible genotypes and phenotypes that can result from this mating. From the given documents, we know that HL-A has three alleles (A, A', O) and GLO also has three alleles. Similarly, Sap-A has three alleles (A, A', O). Since the question does not mention any specific relationship between these loci, we will assume that they are independent. Therefore, each parent can contribute one of their two alleles to each of the three genes. This gives a total of 2^3 = 8 possible genotypes for each parent. The number of possible genotypes for the offspring is then 8 x 8 = 64. Among these 64 genotypes, only AABBCC is of interest. We can determine this by checking if both parents contribute A alleles to Sap-A and HL-A, B alleles to GLO, and C alleles to a third locus (Sap-B or another unmentioned gene). This gives us the desired frequency.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
