["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about plaque accumulation on tooth surfaces. We can infer that poor oral hygiene is likely associated with inadequate brushing, which may lead to the buildup of plaque. The studies provided suggest that dental floss has a greater plaque-removing effect than toothpicks or foam brushes. This implies that interproximal areas may be more prone to plaque accumulation. Therefore, we should focus on these areas for plaque accumulation. The palatal surfaces of upper molars and lingual surfaces of lower incisors are not mentioned in any of the provided studies as areas prone to plaque buildup.\", \"answer_choice\": B}"]
