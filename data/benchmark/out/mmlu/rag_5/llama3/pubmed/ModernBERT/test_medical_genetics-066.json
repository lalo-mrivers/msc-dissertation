["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about disorders suitable for population carrier screening. The relevant documents mention medical devices (US regulatory hurdles), laboratories (CLIA-88 final rule), occupational medicine, and mass ECG studies. However, none of these topics directly relate to the question. The document '[Results of mass ECG studies with the use of the Sicard automatic system]' does discuss population screening, but it's about cardiac diagnoses not genetic disorders. Therefore, we need to consider the options provided. Cystic fibrosis is a genetic disorder and may be suitable for population carrier screening. Oculocutaneous albinism is also a genetic disorder that may be suitable. Sickle cell disease is an inherited blood disorder that can be detected through population carrier screening. Tay-Sachs disease is a genetic disorder caused by the absence of an enzyme and may also be suitable. However, since there are no specific guidelines or regulations provided in the given documents about population carrier screening for genetic disorders, we need to rely on general medical knowledge.\", \"answer_choice\": C}"]
