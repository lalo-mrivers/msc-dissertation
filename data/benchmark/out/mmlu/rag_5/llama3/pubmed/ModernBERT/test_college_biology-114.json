["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about how mutations in DNA can result in a new phenotype. Upon reviewing the provided documents, I notice that there are discussions on genetic code, gene replication, and homeobox genes. These concepts suggest that changes in DNA can affect the expression of genes, leading to a new phenotype. The relevant document discussing Knotted homeobox gene shows how gain-of-function mutations can cause cells to take alternative fates, resulting in a new phenotype. This implies that small changes in DNA can lead to significant effects on development and thus the expression of a new phenotype.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
