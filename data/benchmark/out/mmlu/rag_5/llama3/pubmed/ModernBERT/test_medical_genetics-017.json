["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the estimated number of human protein-coding genes. There is no relevant information provided from the given documents that directly answers this question. However, we can rule out options D and C as they seem too high. The other two options B and A are close to each other but still a bit far away from the correct answer. Since there is no specific information about human protein-coding genes in the provided documents, we will have to rely on general knowledge. According to various sources, including scientific articles and databases, it is estimated that there are around 20,000-25,000 human protein-coding genes. However, this estimate may be refined over time as more research is conducted.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
