["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about a goose species that nests on both cliffs and beaches. The key point to consider is that chicks from cliff nests must tumble down the cliff to get to the ocean, which results in many being killed by the fall. To determine whether cliff nesting is adaptive, we need to think about what would happen if it wasn't an adaptation. If more geese nested on beaches than cliffs (choice A), it wouldn't support the hypothesis that cliff nesting is adaptive. Similarly, if beach nesting was higher fitness than cliff nesting (choice B), it would also not be consistent with the hypothesis. Choice C seems unlikely as chicks don't instinctively step off cliffs at a specific time. The only option left is D, which suggests that more chicks survive the fall from the cliffs than are killed.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
