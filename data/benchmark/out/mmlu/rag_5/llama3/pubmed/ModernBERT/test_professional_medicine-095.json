["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has developed increasing pain in his left foot 2 days after a left femoral-popliteal bypass grafting. The surgical incision appears clean and well approximated without abnormal erythema or swelling, but the left lower extremity and foot appear pale with a cool, pulseless foot.
