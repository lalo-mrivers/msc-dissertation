["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks which process uses the gradient of material to control the direction of movement across the cell membrane. Based on the provided documents, we can identify that osmosis is a process where materials move from an area of high concentration to low concentration through a selectively permeable membrane. This movement occurs due to the concentration gradient, and no energy or pumps are required. Therefore, it uses only the gradient of material to control the direction in which the material moves across the cell membrane.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
