["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The original sequence produces a transmembrane protein that facilitates potassium entry into muscle cells. The modification is changing the sequence of one or more nucleotides, but the overall length and structure of the RNA remain the same. Therefore, we can expect the modified sequence to still produce a similar-sized protein. However, since some nucleotides have been changed, the resulting protein may be dysfunctional or altered in some way. Based on this information, the most likely outcome is the production of a larger, likely dysfunctional protein.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
