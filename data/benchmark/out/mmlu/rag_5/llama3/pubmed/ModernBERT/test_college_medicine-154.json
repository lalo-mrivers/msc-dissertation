["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the location of phosphocreatine in muscle cells. The relevant information is found in the document 'Metabolism of testosterone in rat Sertoli cells'. This document does not provide direct information on phosphocreatine, but it mentions the conversion of testosterone into androstenedione and 5 alpha-dihydro-testosterone. This finding favours the hypothesis which gives the Sertoli cell an important role in germ cell maturation. There is no mention of muscle cells or phosphocreatine in this document.\", \"answer_choice\": D}"]
