["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has a family history of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) with affected relatives. Her brother and maternal uncle had DMD and died at ages 28 and 17 years, respectively. The patient's mother has an elevated muscle creatine kinase concentration (300 U/L). Given the X-linked recessive inheritance pattern of DMD, the patient is likely a carrier if her mother is also a carrier. However, genetic analysis was not performed on either relative prior to death. Therefore, we cannot rule out the possibility that the affected relatives had another underlying condition. Nevertheless, based on the available information and family history, it is more likely that the patient is a carrier of DMD.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
