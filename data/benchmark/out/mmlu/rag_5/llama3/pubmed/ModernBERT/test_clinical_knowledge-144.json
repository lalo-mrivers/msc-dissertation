["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the energy charge of a cell. None of the provided documents mention the difference between the charge on the outside and inside of a cell or sodium-potassium ATPase, which rules out options A and B. The concept of energy charge is related to the level of phosphorylation of adenine nucleotides in the cell, as described in [Temperature-dependence of biological process (author's transl)]. Therefore, option D is the most likely answer.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
