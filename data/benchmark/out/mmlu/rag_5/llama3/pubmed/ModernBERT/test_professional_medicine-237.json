["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has a history of painless swelling of both ankles, shortness of breath with exertion and when lying down, and no chest pain. The physical examination reveals jugular venous pressure at 15 cm H2O, pulmonary crackles at both lung bases, a regular heart rhythm, and a holosystolic murmur best heard at the apex radiating to the axilla.
