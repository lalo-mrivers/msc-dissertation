["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about muscle lactate production. The provided documents don't directly relate to muscle lactate production. However, one document mentions changes in liquid-junction potential in cat papillary muscle. This doesn't seem relevant to the question either. Another document discusses beta-adrenergic blockade on intramuscular triglyceride mobilization during exercise. This also seems unrelated. The remaining two documents mention melatonin and ADP affecting platelet metabolism, and protein content changes in the parietal cortex. These aren't directly related to muscle lactate production. Therefore, I must look for an indirect connection between the provided information and the question.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
