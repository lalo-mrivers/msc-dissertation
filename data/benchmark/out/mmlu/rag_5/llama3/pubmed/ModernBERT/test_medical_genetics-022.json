["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the provided documents, we can see that glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency is mentioned as being autosomal in inheritance pattern. Specifically, document 2 mentions an autosomal glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase polymorphism with two alleles Sgd-1 and Sgd-2. Document 4 also suggests that the gene for G6PD deficiency (GdA-/GdB) confers an advantage against malaria. Based on this information, we can infer that the pattern of inheritance is autosomal.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
