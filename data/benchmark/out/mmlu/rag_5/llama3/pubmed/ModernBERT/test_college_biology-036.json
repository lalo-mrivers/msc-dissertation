["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"There is no direct information about sarcomere in the provided documents. However, we can consider the knowledge about muscle structure from different sources. In striated muscles like skeletal muscles, the sarcomere is the functional unit of the muscle fiber. It consists of actin and myosin filaments, with tropomyosin playing a role in regulating access to the binding site of actin by myosin. Therefore, we can eliminate option D as it describes the thick and thin filaments incorrectly. Considering the structure of sarcomere, during contraction H zones would not become elongated but rather disappear. So, option A is incorrect. Each myosin helical tail indeed contains an actin-binding site and an ATP-hydrolyzing site (option C). Tropomyosin impedes myosin's access to the binding site of actin when the muscle is relaxed (option B), which suggests that the muscle is unable to contract.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
