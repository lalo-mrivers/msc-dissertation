["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the ductus arteriosus in the fetus. The relevant information can be found in [Effects of mechanical stimulation on vascularization of the wall of major arteries] which describes the anatomy of large arteries and their vasculature. According to this document, vasa vasorum penetrate from t. adventitia into t. media with formation of vessel sprouting and migration of the endothelial cells.
