["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Gene flow between populations refers to the movement of genes from one population to another. Since the gene flow is between populations, it does not necessarily affect the genetic makeup of individual individuals within each population. Instead, it would lead to an exchange of genetic information between the two populations. Therefore, the effect on the metapopulation would be an increase in genetic diversity as the gene pool becomes more heterogeneous.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
