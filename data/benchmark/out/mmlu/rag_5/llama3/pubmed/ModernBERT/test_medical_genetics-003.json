["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the normal pairing of adenine in DNA. The provided documents mention nucleotide sequences, gene maps, and telomers, but they don't explicitly discuss the pairing of adenine with other nucleotides. However, we can consider the structure of DNA, which is composed of two strands that are held together by hydrogen bonds between the nitrogenous bases. Adenine always pairs with thymine, forming an A-T base pair, and guanine always pairs with cytosine, forming a G-C base pair.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
