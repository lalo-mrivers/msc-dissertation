["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Comparing the given options to the relevant documents, we can see that decreasing the partial pressure gradient of a gas would decrease the driving force for diffusion (A). Decreasing solubility of a gas in water might affect its concentration but not the rate of diffusion per se. Increasing total surface area available for diffusion would increase the rate of diffusion, which aligns with option C. Finally, decreasing the rate of blood flow through the pulmonary capillary could actually decrease the rate at which the gas diffuses between the alveoli and the blood, as there is less fluid motion to facilitate transport.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
