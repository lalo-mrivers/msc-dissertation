["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about laboratory findings that would support the hypothesis that stress of studying for examinations adversely affects the immune system. We know that stress can cause a decrease in cortisol levels (Stability of ethnic differences in children's pressor responses during three annual examinations). Additionally, studies have shown that chronic stress can suppress the immune system and increase susceptibility to infections (What is stressful about in vitro fertilization?). Given this information, we are looking for laboratory findings that would support the idea that stress affects the immune system. Decreased AM serum cortisol concentration fits this hypothesis, as cortisol levels typically decrease under stress. Macrophage activity or basophil count do not directly relate to the immune system's response to stress. Increased lymphocyte count could potentially indicate an immune response, but it is unclear how this would support the idea that stress affects the immune system. Therefore, we are left with decreased AM serum cortisol concentration as the most likely laboratory finding.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
