["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the phase diagram for water. The relevant documents do not directly discuss the phase diagram or equilibrium lines. However, one of the papers discusses the density of H2O(s) and H2O(l). The modified Arrhenius equation in [Temperature-dependence of biological process (author's transl)] could be used to understand temperature-dependent changes in density. Nevertheless, the main point is that the Wilson-Cowan equations in [A simple case of the Wilson-Cowan equations] do not provide any information about the phase diagram or the equilibrium line for water.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
