["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the expected incidence of affected homozygous females, we need to consider that the X-linked recessive disorder is in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. This means that the genotype frequencies follow a binomial distribution. We are given that the incidence in males equals 1 in 100. Since the disorder is recessive and sex-linked, all affected individuals will be hemizygous males. The frequency of the mutated allele (q) can be calculated from the Hardy-Weinberg equation: p^2 + 2pq + q^2 = 1. Rearranging to solve for q, we get: q = sqrt(1 - p^2). Since the incidence in males is 1 in 100, the frequency of the mutated allele (q) can be calculated from this value.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
