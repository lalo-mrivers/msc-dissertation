["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about song development in birds. The relevant information comes from the 'Species identification in the North American cowbird' document. According to this document, female cowbirds raised in auditory isolation responded to the songs of male cowbirds with copulatory postures. The songs of males reared in isolated were more effective in eliciting the posture than the songs of normally reared males. This suggests that the song characteristics are learned rather than instinctive. The question also mentions that when a young male reared in isolation hears only the song of a different bird species, he will develop an adult song repertoire that lacks certain characteristics typical of his own species. This result shows that the song of his species is not entirely instinctive or dependent upon hormones for proper development. Therefore, it can be concluded that the song is both learned and instinctive.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
