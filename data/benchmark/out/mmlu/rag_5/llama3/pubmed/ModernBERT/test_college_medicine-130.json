["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking why proteins are treated with a detergent (SDS) before being run through an SDS-PAGE procedure. The key to answering this question is understanding the role of SDS in the electrophoresis process. From the relevant documents, it is clear that Triton X-100 is a detergent used to solubilize membrane proteins and separate them based on their electric charge. This suggests that detergents are used to modify the properties of proteins so they can be separated and analyzed more effectively. In the context of SDS-PAGE, SDS serves as a detergent, likely by denaturing the proteins and breaking down any tertiary or intramolecular bonds. This allows the proteins to be sorted based on their size (primary sequence) rather than their native structure.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
