["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the ATP store in muscle. We need to find information related to the duration of high intensity exercise that the ATP store can support. The provided documents mention energy balance in muscle contraction (activation heat), CPK turnover during exercise, and acid extrusion process.

Therefore, we should focus on the concept of 'initial heat production' mentioned in one of the documents.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
