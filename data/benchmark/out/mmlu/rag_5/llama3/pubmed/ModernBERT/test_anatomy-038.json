A quick search through the provided documents doesn't reveal any information directly related to bronchioles or their structure. However, I can try to think step-by-step by considering what types of tissues are typically found in respiratory passages. Bronchioles are small airways that lead to alveoli, where gas exchange occurs. This is not directly mentioned in the provided documents, but we do have information about the eyelid and hand surgery.
