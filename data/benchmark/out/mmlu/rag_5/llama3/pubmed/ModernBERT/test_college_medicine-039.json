["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the activity of creatine kinase. We have two relevant documents that mention creatine kinase: 'Evidence for significant quantities of creatine kinase MM isoenzyme in human brain' and 'Identification of cAMP dependant protein kinases in human lymphocytes'. The first document states that approximately 30% of total creatine kinase activity is due to the MM isoenzyme. There's no mention of ADP, pH, or training affecting the activity of creatine kinase.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
