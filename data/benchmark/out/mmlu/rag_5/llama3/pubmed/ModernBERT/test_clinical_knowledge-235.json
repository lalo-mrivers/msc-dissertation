["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the blood glucose concentration during intermittent high intensity exercise. The relevant documents mention VO2 max, insulin sensitivity, and glucose assimilation. We can eliminate options D (falls to hypoglycaemic levels) as it's not mentioned in any of the provided documents. Among the remaining options, we don't see any significant changes in blood glucose concentration during exercise in any of the studies. For example, in the study on diabetic adolescents deprived of insulin, there was no increase in glucose assimilation during physical activity at rest or with increased concentrations of insulin.\", \"answer_choice\": B}"]
