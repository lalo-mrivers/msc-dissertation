["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Since the mice were genetically modified to lose their hearing, we can't directly compare the results to human audiograms. However, we can look at the relevant studies provided. The study on auditory sensitivity of albino rats shows that they are most sensitive to tones of 8 kHz but are almost as sensitive at 38 kHz. Since the bell is likely producing a tone, we can assume it's not at a frequency close to 30-40 kHz. Therefore, we should focus on the power levels.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: Not enough information given.\""]
