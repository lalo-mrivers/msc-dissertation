["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The student's process is characterized by actively relating the new information about electrochemical cells to previous knowledge about redox reactions. This indicates that the student is building upon prior learning and making connections between concepts. Elaborative rehearsal involves the creation of new associations, elaboration on existing ones, and the integration of new information into a larger framework. This aligns with the student's approach as they learn advanced concepts by drawing upon previously learned redox reactions.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: Elaborative rehearsal\""]
