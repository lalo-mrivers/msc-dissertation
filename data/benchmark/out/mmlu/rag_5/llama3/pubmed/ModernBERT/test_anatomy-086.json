["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the postnatal growth of the maxilla. The relevant information can be found by reading through the provided documents. None of the documents directly address the topic of maxillary growth, but they provide general information on anatomy and pathology that may be helpful in answering this question. The document 'Renal fascia of Gerota' mentions various arrangements described in the literature regarding the configuration of the renal fascia, which is not relevant to this question. However, it does mention a consensus derived from these descriptions. This suggests that there can be variation in the configuration of anatomical structures, including the maxilla.\n\nThe document '[Ossification of the transverse ligament]' reports two cases of ossification of the transverse ligament and notes that this abnormality is rare but important to know about. This may suggest that there are different ways in which bones can develop or change over time, including the maxilla.\n\nThe documents 'The deformity produced by a palsy of the marginal mandibular branch of the facial nerve' and '[Is there an internal tongue musculature in parrots?]' provide information on specific anatomical structures, but they do not directly address the topic of maxillary growth. However, the first document does mention that damage to the marginal mandibular branch of the facial nerve can cause a deformity, which may suggest that bones or other structures can change shape over time.\n\nThe document '[The earwig (author's transl)]' is about the earwig and its relationship to the external auditory canal. It does not provide any information relevant to this question.\n\nIn summary, while none of the documents directly address the topic of maxillary growth, they do provide some general information on anatomy and pathology that may be helpful in answering this question. The most important piece of information is the suggestion that there can be variation in the configuration of anatomical structures, including the maxilla.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer is: C\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
