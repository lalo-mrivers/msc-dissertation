["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the point at which an impulse is transmitted from one neuron to another neuron. The relevant documents discuss different aspects of neuronal circuits and transmission. In [Effects of experience on brain morphology and its relationship to learning and memory], it mentions that the complete morphological and biochemical development of a neuron depends on the impulses it receives from the neuron before, indicating some sort of transmission process. However, this document does not specifically mention the point at which an impulse is transmitted. The other documents do not seem directly relevant to this question either. Therefore, we should look more closely at the provided choices.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
