["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks which of the following can act as an intracellular buffer to limit pH changes when the rate of glycolysis is high. The relevant information is found in the 'Active control of intracellular pH' document, which describes a process where the squid giant axon extrudes acid by exchanging external HCO3- for internal Cl- at the expense of ATP. This suggests that bicarbonate can act as an intracellular buffer to limit pH changes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"]
