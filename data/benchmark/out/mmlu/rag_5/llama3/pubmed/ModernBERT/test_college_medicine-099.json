["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the trigger to initiate the contractile process in skeletal muscle. In the provided documents, we have information on muscle contraction and actomyosin dissociation. The document 'Kinetic model of a single muscle contraction' provides details on the kinetics of muscle contraction parameters correlated with the concentration of the mediator-receptor complex. This suggests that ATP binding to myosin cross bridges could be the trigger.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
