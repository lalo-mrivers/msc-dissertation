["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the provided documents, I found no direct reference to oedema or its definition. However, as a medical expert, I can rely on general knowledge to answer this question. Oedema is a swelling caused by excess fluid accumulation in the interstitial tissue.

As there are no references indicating oedema being related to intracranial fluid (C) or necrotic cells (D), these options can be ruled out.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
