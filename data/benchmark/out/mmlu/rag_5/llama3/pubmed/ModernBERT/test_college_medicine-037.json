["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about women's world record performances improving rapidly. The provided documents talk about various medical topics such as cystic fibrosis, pediatric cardiac pacing, cross-country skiing, and thermoregulatory problems encountered in ice hockey. However, none of these documents mention anything about women's world record performances. Therefore, the answer cannot be found in these documents. We need to look outside these documents for an answer. The question does not specify whether the improvement is related to a particular sport or not. However, one document mentions that there has been an improvement in life expectancy in cystic fibrosis, which might suggest that improvements can occur rapidly across various domains. Another document discusses how athletic injuries have decreased over time. These could be indirect hints towards the answer.\n\nNow, let's look at the question choices: A - women have evolved a greater muscle mass; B - women can now run faster than men; C - women have started training at an earlier age; D - more women are now engaged in sport. The most plausible reason seems to be D - more women are now engaged in sport, given that athletic performances tend to improve as more people participate and train.\n\nFinally, we can conclude that the answer is likely D, but it requires external knowledge and not directly related to the provided documents.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
