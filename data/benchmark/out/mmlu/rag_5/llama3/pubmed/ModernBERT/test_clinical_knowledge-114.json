["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about an allele that is masked. This makes me think of genetics and how alleles can be expressed or masked. In genetics, a recessive allele is one that will not be expressed if there is a dominant allele present. However, the recessive allele is still present in the individual's genotype. The term 'masked' suggests that the allele is still present but not being expressed. Therefore, I think of recessive as an option.\", \"answer_choice\": A}"]
