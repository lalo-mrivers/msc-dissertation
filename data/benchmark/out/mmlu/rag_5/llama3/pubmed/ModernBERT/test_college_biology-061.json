["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks which fact was established prior to 1859. The provided documents do not mention DNA, Mendelian principles, or prokaryotes. However, the document 'Early experiences of ether anaesthesia in North Wales' mentions the year 1847. This gives us a time frame before 1859.
