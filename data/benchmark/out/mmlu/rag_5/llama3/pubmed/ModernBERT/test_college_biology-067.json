["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking which plant cells undergo programmed cell death to become functional. The provided documents don't mention anything about programmed cell death or apoptosis in plant cells. However, we can infer that the question is trying to test our knowledge of different types of plant cells and their functions.\n\nLet's look at the options: A, B, C, and D are all types of plant cells. We need to find out which one undergoes programmed cell death to become functional.\n\nAfter careful consideration, I'm not finding any information in the provided documents that suggests a specific type of plant cell undergoes programmed cell death to become functional. The documents focus on different aspects such as yeast cell cycle control, sialic acid's role in cell surface rigidity, and interkinetic nuclear migration in chick embryo nasal placode cells.\n\nHowever, if we look at the options, one stands out: D, Root cap cell. Although it's not explicitly mentioned that root cap cells undergo programmed cell death to become functional, they are known for their unique function of replacing worn-out cells as the plant grows. This process can be interpreted as a form of 'cell death' or replacement.\n\nBased on this analysis, I'm going to choose option D as my answer.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
