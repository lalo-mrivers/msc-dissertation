["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The provided documents describe various biological processes, including mitochondrial membrane interactions and heat exchange. However, none of these documents explicitly mention the transport of fatty acids into mitochondria. Therefore, we need to look for a connection between the provided information and the options presented. Option D, carnitine, is known to play a role in the transport of fatty acids across the outer mitochondrial membrane. This is supported by studies that have shown that carnitine facilitates the entry of long-chain fatty acids into mitochondria.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
