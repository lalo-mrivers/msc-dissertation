["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about a sound wave traveling from one medium to another. When a sound exits the first medium and enters a denser medium, some properties of the sound will change while others remain constant. The key here is that the frequency of the sound wave remains constant, as it's determined by the source emitting the sound. The wavelength and velocity of the sound wave, on the other hand, are affected by the density of the medium.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
