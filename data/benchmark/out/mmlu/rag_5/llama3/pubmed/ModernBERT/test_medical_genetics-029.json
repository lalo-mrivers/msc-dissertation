["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Since the disorder is autosomal recessive, each parent must be a carrier of the mutated gene. Both parents are affected, which means they both carry two copies of the mutated gene (homozygous). Since the children inherit one set of chromosomes from each parent, all possible genotypes and phenotypes can be determined: - FF (wild-type): unaffected - MM (mutated): affected - FM (carrier): carrier (but not affected) Given this information, the probability that each child will be affected is equal to the probability that they will inherit two copies of the mutated gene (MM). Since both parents are homozygous for the mutated gene, the probability of each child inheriting MM is 1. Therefore, the probability that each child will be affected is 1, which corresponds to option D.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
