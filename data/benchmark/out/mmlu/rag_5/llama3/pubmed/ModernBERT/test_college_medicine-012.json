["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about a teenager's behavior that violates society's norms. The possible norms mentioned are mores (social norms), folkways (customs), the law, and taboo (prohibitions). Let's analyze the sequence of events: i) consensual sexual intercourse with sister - this could be related to family or incest taboo; ii) no tip at the bar - this is a matter of folkway or custom; iii) non-consensual sexual relations with an unknown woman - this is a violation of mores and potentially the law as well; iv) vomiting on the steps of a local church - this could be related to folkway or custom. Considering the sequence, it seems that taboo (incest taboo) comes first, followed by folkways (customs), then the law, and finally more social norms.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: taboo, folkways, the law, and mores\""]
