["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has a history of increasing shortness of breath, sore throat, and a cough productive of white phlegm. She also has weight loss and a nontender lymph node in the right supraclavicular area. The chest x-ray shows a large right lower lobe density and CT scan reveals a mass with scattered calcifications that abuts the posterior chest wall without clear invasion. There are also enlarged lymph nodes and a mass in the adrenal gland. Given this information, I would think of primary lung cancer or metastatic disease to the lung.\n\nThe patient has a history of smoking and drinking alcohol, which increases her risk for lung cancer. The presence of a large right lower lobe density on chest x-ray is also consistent with primary lung cancer. The CT scan findings suggest that the mass may be primary in origin rather than secondary to metastatic disease.\n\nConsidering the patient's history and imaging studies, I would think that the biopsy specimen of the lung mass is most likely to show either non-small cell lung carcinoma or metastatic adenocarcinoma of the breast.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
