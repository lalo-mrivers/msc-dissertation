["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is experiencing chest pain and shortness of breath after snorting cocaine for the first time. He has a history of unremarkable medical conditions. The ECG shows sinus tachycardia with no ST-segment or T-wave abnormalities. Considering the patient's symptoms, we should look at other possible causes rather than cardiovascular issues.\n\nThe case reports on petroleum aspiration and inhalation, deep hypothermia, and subarachnoid hemorrhage do not provide relevant information for this situation.\n\nHowever, the report on glossopharyngeal neuralgia associated with right-bundle branch block and hypotension after sectioning a rootlet of the vagus nerve is important. The patient's symptoms are more related to cardiovascular issues, but the report highlights that even though the ECG shows sinus tachycardia, there might be other cardiac issues.\n\nConsidering this information, we should focus on possible cardiac causes and potential complications from cocaine use.\n\nThe case report on intracerebral arteriovenous fistula does not provide relevant information for this situation.\n\nGiven these considerations, we can think about the patient's symptoms and possible causes.\n\nThe patient is experiencing chest pain and shortness of breath. The ECG shows sinus tachycardia with no ST-segment or T-wave abnormalities. He has a history of unremarkable medical conditions.\n\nIn this case, it seems that the patient might be experiencing a cocaine-related vasospasm, which could be causing his symptoms. Given this possibility, we should consider medications that can help relax blood vessels and reduce vasoconstriction.\n\nThe options provided are:\n\nA: Carvedilol (an alpha- and beta-adrenergic blocking agent)\nB: Furosemide (a diuretic that can cause vasodilation)\nC: Metoprolol (a selective beta blocker)\nD: Phentolamine (an alpha-blocking agent)\n\nGiven the patient's symptoms and possible causes, the most appropriate additional pharmacotherapy to initiate at this time would be...\"\n\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
