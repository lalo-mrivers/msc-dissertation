["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about intravenous (IV) drug administration. We need to analyze the relevant documents to find information related to IV drug administration. From the provided articles, none of them specifically discuss IV drug administration. However, we can try to apply general principles from other fields of medicine or pharmacology to this specific context. One article that catches my attention is 'Analysis of theoretical behavior of a proposed zero-order drug delivery system'. This article discusses the release of drugs over time, which might be relevant to IV administration. Another article that could be useful is 'Novel method for the determination of pediatric dosages', as it talks about drug distribution in body water compartments, which could be related to IV administration. However, neither of these articles provides direct information on IV drug administration. We need to rely on general medical knowledge and pharmacology principles to answer this question.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"]
