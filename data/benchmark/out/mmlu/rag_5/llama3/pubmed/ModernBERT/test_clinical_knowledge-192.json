["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the products of ADP degradation that increase in concentration in blood during multiple sprint sports. Initially, we need to identify what happens to ADP in such situations. One of the provided documents explains the effect of ADP on platelet metabolism in vitro. According to this document, ADP induces an apparent protrusion by rat's megakaryocytes in vitro. This suggests that ADP plays a role in platelet activity. The other relevant document discusses the thrombocyte refractory state and how ADP-induced platelet aggregation is decreased during incubation of platelet-rich plasma with ADP. This indicates that ADP can be degraded, which might lead to an increase in its degradation products in blood. Considering these findings, we should look for documents discussing what happens to ADP when it's degraded. The document about cellular basis for the T wave of the electrocardiogram does not provide relevant information. The other two documents, however, do mention ADP degradation products. A plasma protein mobilizing factor in dogs following hemorrhage discusses how small amounts of whole blood from repeatedly bled donors increase the replacement rate of plasma protein in dogs, cats and rabbits subjected to hemorrhage. This could be related to ADP degradation, as one of its products might enhance plasma protein replacement. The effects of induced lathyrism on Sr85 uptake in rats during late prenatal development study does not provide relevant information. Based on this step-by-step thinking process, we can deduce that the question is related to the degradation products of ADP.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
