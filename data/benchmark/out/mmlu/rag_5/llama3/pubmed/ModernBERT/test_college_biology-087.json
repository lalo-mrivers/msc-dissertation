["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, I focused on the information related to sexual selection and mating. In 'Recognition and sexual selection in Drosophila', it is stated that Drosophila pseudoobscura females show a positive bias toward mating with males whose proportion in the population is low. This suggests that females are selective when choosing mates. Additionally, in 'Inheritance of porcine von Willbrand's disease', there is no mention of intense competition between males or females for individual food resources.\n\nI then looked at the provided options and considered each one: A refers to competition over food, which is not mentioned; C refers to female-male interaction but does not fit the context of sexual dimorphism; D refers to female choice in mate selection. This last option aligns with the information presented about the Drosophila pseudoobscura females.\n\nTherefore, I concluded that intense competition between females to obtain mates would be a more likely explanation for high degree of sexual dimorphism in primates.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
