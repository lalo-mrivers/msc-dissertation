["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about contraindications for DtaP immunization. The relevant documents are a case of bilateral chylothorax in the 36th week of pregnancy, a discussion on serological monitoring of children with suspected congenital toxoplasmosis, a case of adult Still's disease, and a case of haemorrhage responsive to vitamin K in a 6-week-old infant.

The other options do not seem directly related to DtaP immunization.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
