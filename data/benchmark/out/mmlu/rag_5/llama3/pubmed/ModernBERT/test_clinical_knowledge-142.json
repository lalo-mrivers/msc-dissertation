["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents discuss muscle contraction mechanisms. The first document suggests that the back stroke of myosin bridges is determined by nucleotide binding, implying a role for ATP or its derivatives in muscle contraction. The second document discusses the transformation of skeletal muscle type and the effects of cross reinnervation, which does not directly relate to the trigger of contractile process. The third document proposes a kinetic model of single muscle contraction, which involves enzymatic mediator splitting, but it does not specify the trigger for this process. The fourth document describes cytokinesis, which is a cellular process unrelated to skeletal muscle contraction. Based on these documents, the most relevant information comes from the first document's discussion of myosin bridges and nucleotide binding.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
