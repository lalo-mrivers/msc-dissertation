["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about reflexes, specifically which option is true. None of the relevant documents mention reflexes or nervous system assessments, so it's necessary to rely on general knowledge and medical principles. The babinski reflex is a sign of an upper motor neuron lesion, not a normal flexor response. An extensor plantar response indicates a lower motor neurone lesion, which is true. The root value of the ankle reflex is L4-L5 and S1, not just S1. The root value of the knee reflex is L2-L4, not just L1, L2. Therefore, option B and D are correct.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
