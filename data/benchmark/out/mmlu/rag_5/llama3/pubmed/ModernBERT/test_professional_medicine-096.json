["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 9-year-old boy with progressive weakness and a purple-red discoloration over his cheeks and upper eyelids. The symptoms started shortly after a camping trip, but there was no exposure to poisonous plants or tick bites. The patient has had weight loss and atrophy of the proximal muscles. The skin lesions are consistent with a dermatosis in areas subject to friction or pressure, such as the elbows and knees. Additionally, the patient has periorbital edema, erythematous plaques, and scales over his elbows and knees. This is consistent with the 'flaky paint' dermatosis seen in kwashiorkor.
