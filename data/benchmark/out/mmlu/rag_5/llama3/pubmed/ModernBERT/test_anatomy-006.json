["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the anatomical region of abdomen that lies just distal to the sternum. The relevant information is from the first document which describes a pair of sternalis muscles located superficial to the medial part of the pectoralis major, arising from the sternum. This implies that the sternalis muscle is positioned close to the sternum. Therefore, we can conclude that the anatomical region of abdomen just distal to the sternum is likely to be the epigastric region.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
