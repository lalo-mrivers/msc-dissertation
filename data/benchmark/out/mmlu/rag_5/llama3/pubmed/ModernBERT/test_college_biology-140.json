["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Since the question is asking about fungi, we need to look for information that is relevant to fungal cell walls. In the provided documents, none of the topics seem directly related to fungal cell walls. However, in 'Structure of proteins: packing of alpha-helices and pleated sheets', there is a mention of chitin which is a type of polysaccharide found in the exoskeletons of insects and some fungi. This seems like a relevant connection to make. Since none of the other options seem related to fungal cell walls, it's likely that chitin is the correct answer.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
