["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the initial breakdown of glycogen in muscle. The relevant documents mention changes in glycogen content in rat muscle denervated by different procedures. We can see that there is no direct information on glycogen breakdown, but we can look for related concepts. The document 'Different changes of glycogen content in rat muscle denervated by different procedures' mentions the endocrine function after denervation, which could be relevant to glycogen metabolism. However, the focus is on changes in glycogen levels rather than breakdown. We also don't find any information on glucose or phosphate derivatives. The other documents seem unrelated to glycogen breakdown.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"]
