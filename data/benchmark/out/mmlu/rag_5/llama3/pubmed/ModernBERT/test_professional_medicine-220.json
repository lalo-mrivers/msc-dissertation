["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the effect of changing alpha (the significance level) from 0.05 to 0.01 on a placebo-controlled clinical trial. Since the sample size is large (5000 patients), even with an alpha of 0.01, the study will still have sufficient power to detect statistically significant differences between the new drug and standard therapy. Therefore, the most likely result is that there will be no difference in the significance of findings compared to setting alpha at 0.05.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
