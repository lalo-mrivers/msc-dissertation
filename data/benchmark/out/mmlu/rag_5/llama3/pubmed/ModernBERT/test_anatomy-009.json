["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents provided are studies on somatosensory evoked responses, cortical evoked response olfactometry, posttraumatic alterations, skeletal muscle recovery process, and brain-cutting device. To answer the question, we need to focus on primary motor cortex activity. From the given options, the most plausible explanation is that primary motor cortex activity results in the contraction of contralateral limb musculature (option D). This is because the primary motor cortex is responsible for controlling voluntary movements, and its stimulation typically leads to muscle contraction on the opposite side of the body.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
