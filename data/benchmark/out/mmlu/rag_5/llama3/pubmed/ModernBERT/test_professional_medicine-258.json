["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question describes a 4-year-old boy with a history of chronic recurrent otitis media. The patient recently completed a 10-day course of antibiotics. Examination shows clear ear canals and intact tympanic membranes; a brown, irregular mass is visualized behind the tympanic membrane. This suggests that the mass is not causing any immediate symptoms such as hearing loss or discharge.
