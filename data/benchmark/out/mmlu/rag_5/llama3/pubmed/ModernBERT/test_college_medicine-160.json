["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about molecules that form part of DNA. The relevant documents are about molecular weights, taxonomic characters, and biological processes like pattern formation. None of these topics relate to the composition of DNA. Therefore, we need to look at the chemical structure of DNA. DNA is composed of nucleotides which contain a base (purine or pyrimidine), a sugar molecule (deoxyribose) and a phosphate group. Amino acids are building blocks of proteins, not part of DNA.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
