["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the initial energy source for very high force contractions lasting 1-2 seconds. The provided documents are all related to medical devices or techniques, but none of them specifically discuss muscle physiology or energy metabolism. Therefore, we must rely on our general knowledge of muscle physiology and exercise science. High-force contractions typically require rapid energy release, which is achieved through the breakdown of phosphocreatine (PCr) stores. This process is known as the creatine kinase reaction. PCr is a high-energy compound that can rapidly donate its phosphate group to ADP to form ATP. During high-intensity exercise, PCr serves as an important energy buffer, allowing muscles to sustain brief periods of intense activity.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"]
