["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the provided documents, we can see that Friend leukemia cells are thought to represent a population of primitive erythroid cells which have undergone malignant transformation. However, when growing in suspension culture, these cells can exhibit morphologic and enzymatic properties characteristic of primitive granulocytic cells. This suggests that Friend cells may be neoplastic pluripotent hematopoietic stem cells. Similarly, hemopoietic stem cells in human peripheral blood are described as having true pluripotentiality and can differentiate into erythrocytic, granulocytic, and megakaryocytic progeny. Acute myeloblastic leukemia is also considered to originate from pluripotent stem cells. Given this information, it appears that the cell type that would arise from a myeloid progenitor cell under normal circumstances would be a granulocytic or megakaryocytic cell.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
