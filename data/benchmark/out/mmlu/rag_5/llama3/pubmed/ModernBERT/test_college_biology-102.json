["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the stabilization of an alpha helix structure in a protein. The relevant document mentioning alpha-helix is 'The alpha-helix dipole and the properties of proteins.' It suggests that phosphate moieties bind frequently at N-termini of helices in proteins, which corresponds with an optimal interaction of the helix dipole and the charged phosphate. This implies that hydrogen bonding between the peptide backbone atoms plays a crucial role in stabilizing the alpha-helix structure.\", \"answer_choice\": A}"]
