["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the given documents, we can infer that transmission of knowledge through symbolic culture is about learning from others through observation or instruction. In the first document 'Map reading by chimpanzees', infant chimpanzees learn to find a person by observing a small black-and-white closed-circuit television picture of a familiar caretaker walking out into an outdoor field and disappearing from sight. This implies that knowledge transmission can occur through observation or instruction, which is a form of symbolic culture.\n\nIn the other documents, we see examples of learning through instruction or demonstration, such as toilet training in 'Acquisition by a pigtail macaque', social manipulation in 'Acquisition by a pigtail macaque', and reducing soiling behavior in 'The reduction of soiling behaviour in an 11-year-old boy'.\n\nNow, let's analyze the question options. Option I is about learning through observation or instruction, which fits with our understanding of symbolic culture.\n\nOption II is also about learning through instruction, as a child learns the rules of baseball from a parent.\n\nOption III is about hazing rituals, which involves imitation and social learning, but it can be seen as an example of symbolic culture because it's based on learned behaviors and norms.\n\nTherefore, none of the options explicitly exclude transmission of knowledge through symbolic culture. However, if we look closely at each option, we can identify one that does not involve symbolic culture: Option I is about a monkey learning to rinse off food in the ocean by observing an older monkey, which is more about observational learning and not specifically about symbolic culture.\n\nThis leads us to conclude that Option A: I only is the correct answer.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
