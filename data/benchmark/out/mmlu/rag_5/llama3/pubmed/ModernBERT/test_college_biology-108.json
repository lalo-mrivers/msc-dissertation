["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about how marine birds maintain their tissue osmolarity despite drinking seawater. From the provided documents, it can be inferred that osmotic pressure plays a crucial role in the mobility and metabolism of human spermatozoa. This suggests that osmosis is an important mechanism for maintaining internal osmolarity. Marine birds are able to maintain their tissue osmolarity by adapting to the high osmolarity of seawater, which they drink. This is similar to how honey bees adapt to changing osmotic conditions in their rectal fluid.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
