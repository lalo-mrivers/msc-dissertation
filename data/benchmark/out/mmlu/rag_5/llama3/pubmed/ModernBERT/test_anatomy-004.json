["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about a cluster of blood capillaries found in each nephron in the kidney. The provided documents describe various anatomical features, but none specifically relate to the kidney or its function. However, one document mentions the medullary substance in desert birds, which could be relevant.

Further analysis suggests that the medullar cone and Henle's loops may play a role in this process.\", \n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
