["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks which foramina pierce the sphenoid bone. The provided documents do not directly mention the sphenoid bone or its foramina. However, we can use our general knowledge of anatomy to identify the relevant document that describes the structure of the sphenoid bone. Intra-osseous vascularization of the astragalus is irrelevant to the question. Morphology of Piedra hortal and Triple mesiodentes also do not provide information about the sphenoid bone. Non-union of fractures of the clavicle might provide some indirect information, but it is not relevant to this specific question.\\r\\n\\r\\n[About the face value of the cleft of the articulus mandibulae (author's transl)] seems to be the most relevant document. It does not mention foramina, but it talks about the planimetry of negative replicas on the mandibular joints from older men. This might indirectly suggest that we need to look at documents related to anatomy or osteology.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe provided options include several types of foramina, and some of them are specific to the sphenoid bone (e.g., spinosum). The relevant document does not mention these specific foramina, but it suggests that we should look at documents related to anatomy. Using our general knowledge of anatomy, we can infer that the foramina mentioned in the options are typical structures found on the human skull.\\r\\n\\r\\nBased on this information, we can conclude that only option C: The foramen ovale, rotundum and spinosum is a plausible answer. This option includes three types of foramina commonly found on the sphenoid bone.\", \"answer_choice\": C}"]
