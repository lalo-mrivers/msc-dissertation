["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks for experimental observations that would be expected. The key information is that mouse sperm contain receptor proteins that bind to ZP3 in the zona pellucida of mouse eggs and binding initiates the sperm's acrosomal reaction. This suggests that ZP3 plays a crucial role in fertilization. Therefore, we can expect that manipulating ZP3 would affect fertilization.\n\nInjecting antibodies that bind to ZP3 into eggs (option C) would be expected to block in vitro fertilization because it would interfere with the binding of sperm to the egg. Incubating eggs with such antibodies would prevent the normal binding and acrosomal reaction, resulting in blocked fertilization.\n\nIncubating sperm with purified ZP3 prior to mixing sperm and eggs (option B) would also be expected to block in vitro fertilization because it would cause the sperm to undergo acrosomal reaction prematurely, making them unable to fertilize the egg.\n\nInjecting antibodies that bind to ZP3 into eggs (option A) is similar to option C and would also be expected to block in vitro fertilization.\n\nCoating synthetic beads with a different glycoprotein, ZP2 (option D), would not affect fertilization because ZP2 is not involved in the normal fertilization process. Therefore, this observation would NOT be expected.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
