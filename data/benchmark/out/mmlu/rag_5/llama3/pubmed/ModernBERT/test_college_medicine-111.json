["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the volume of a gas at standard atmospheric pressure (1atm) given its original volume and pressure. We can use Charles' Law, which states that for an ideal gas, PV = k, where P is the pressure, V is the volume, and k is a constant. Since the temperature remains constant, we can manipulate the equation to solve for V at 1atm. Let's first find the initial volume (V1) at 200atm: V1 = 0.1L. Then, using Charles' Law, we can find the volume at 1atm: P2V2 = P1V1, where P2 is 1atm and P1 is 200atm. Solving for V2, we get: V2 = (P1/P2)V1 = (200/1) * 0.1L = 20L.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
