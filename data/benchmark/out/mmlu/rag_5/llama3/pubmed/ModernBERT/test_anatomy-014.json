["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the growth of the mandible. From my understanding of human development, I know that the mandible starts developing from the first pharyngeal arch during embryonic stages and continues to grow postnatally. I will now look for relevant information in the provided documents.\n\nAfter reviewing the documents, I did not find any information related to the growth of the mandible. The documents discuss topics such as Pauwels theory, earwig behavior, go-kart injuries, and nurse employment patterns, but none of them provide information about mandibular growth.\n\nAs a result, I will base my answer on general knowledge of human development. The mental symphysis is part of the mandible that fuses around 1-2 years postnatally (Netter's Atlas of Human Anatomy). Therefore, option A is correct.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
