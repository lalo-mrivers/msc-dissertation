["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about blood types and compatibility. A person with a blood group B (rhesus negative) can receive blood from individuals with the same or similar blood type. Blood type B has an antigen called 'B' on the surface of red blood cells, which is not found in people with blood types AB, O, or A. Therefore, the compatible blood types that can be given to a person with a blood group B (rhesus negative) are those with the same B antigen. Blood type B has no anti-A or anti-B antibodies, so it does not react with A or AB blood, and it also doesn't react with O blood because there is no A or B antigen on O blood cells. This leaves only one option: Blood type B (rhesus negative) and blood type O (rhesus negative).\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"]
