["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the dorsal roots of spinal nerves. From the provided documents, none of them specifically describe the composition of the dorsal roots of spinal nerves. However, 'Anatomy of the lumbar spine' provides information on the macroscopic courses of the posterior primary rami in the lumbar spine. This does not directly relate to the question. Similarly, 'New extraocular muscle clamp', 'Anonychia with ectrodactyly', and '[Intrahilar anastomoses of the hepatic artery]' do not provide relevant information for this question. The only document that seems remotely related is '[Double central projection of VIIIth cranial nerve in the frog]', which discusses the degenerations of the anterior or posterior root of the VIIIth nerve. This does not directly relate to spinal nerves, but it gives some insight into the concept of dorsal roots projecting onto different nuclei. From this analysis, we can deduce that the dorsal roots of spinal nerves likely contain sensory neuronal processes.\",\n\"answer_choice\": A"]
