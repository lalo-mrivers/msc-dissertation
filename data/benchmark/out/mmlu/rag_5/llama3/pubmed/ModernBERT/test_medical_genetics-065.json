["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the utility of simple tandem repeat polymorphisms in humans. One of the provided documents is 'Characterization of five new bovine dinucleotide repeats', which describes a technique for detecting and eliminating bovine (TG)n microsatellite sequences. This suggests that simple tandem repeat polymorphisms are useful for some purpose. Another document, 'Simultaneous detection of multiple single-base alleles at a polymorphic site', also discusses PCR amplification of multiple specific alleles, which is related to the concept of simple tandem repeat polymorphisms.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
