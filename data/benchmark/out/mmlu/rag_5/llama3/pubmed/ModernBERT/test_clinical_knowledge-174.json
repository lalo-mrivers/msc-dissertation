["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the process of translation. Translation involves creating a protein from the instructions given by mRNA. The steps involved are transcription (making a complementary RNA from DNA), processing and modification of tRNA, and then the translation itself which occurs on ribosomes using mRNA as a template. Since DNA is not directly involved in this process, it can be eliminated as an option. RNA polymerase is also not directly involved in translation. Therefore, options C and D can be ruled out. The remaining options A and B both involve mRNA and ribosomes, but tRNA is only present in option A which makes it the correct choice.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
