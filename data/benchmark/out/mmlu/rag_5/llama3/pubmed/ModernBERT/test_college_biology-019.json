["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the soils of which biome has the highest rate of leaching and cycling of nutrients. None of the provided documents mention 'leaching' or 'cycling of nutrients'. However, [Seasonal fluctuations in the potential soil capacity for nitrogen fixation] mentions the potential activity of nitrogen fixation in different types of soils. This could be related to nutrient cycling. Soddy-calcareous and continuous-cultivated grey forest soils have the highest ability for potential nitrogen fixation, which might indicate a high rate of nutrient cycling.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
