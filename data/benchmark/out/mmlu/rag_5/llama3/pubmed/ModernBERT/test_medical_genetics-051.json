["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the average number of fragments a restriction enzyme would cleave a double-stranded bacteriophage with a genome size of 5,000 bp into, we need to consider the recognition sequence of the enzyme. A restriction enzyme recognizes a specific 4-base sequence in DNA and cuts the DNA at that site. Therefore, the number of fragments will depend on how many times the 4-base recognition sequence appears in the bacteriophage genome.\n\nThe genome size is 5,000 bp, which means there are 5,000 base pairs. Since the recognition sequence is 4 bases long, we can divide the total number of base pairs by the length of the recognition sequence to get an estimate of how many times it appears: 5,000 / 4 = 1,250.\n\nThis means the restriction enzyme would recognize and cleave the DNA at around 1,250 sites. Therefore, we would expect the bacteriophage genome to be cut into approximately 1,250 fragments.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
