["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about which drug may be used to enhance gastric motility. The provided documents don't directly address the question. However, one of the documents discusses drugs affecting upper respiratory tract motility: cisapride. This suggests that cisapride might have an effect on gastric motility as well. Another document reviews retinoic acid and its potential role in pattern formation. While this is unrelated to the current question, it doesn't provide any information about enhancing gastric motility either. The last two documents deal with iopamidol's effects on neonatal thyroid function and metal removal after osteosynthesis, which are also not relevant to the question.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"]
