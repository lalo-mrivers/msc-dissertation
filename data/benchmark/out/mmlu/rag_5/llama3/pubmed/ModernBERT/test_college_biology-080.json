["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the similarities between cancer cells and normal cells grown in culture. The documents provided show that cancer cells (cytogenetically marked clones) can be present in vivo and still retain their abnormal properties when grown in vitro. This suggests that cancer cells, like normal cells, can maintain their characteristics even after being cultured. Therefore, we can infer that cancer cells grown in culture are similar to normal cells grown in culture.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
