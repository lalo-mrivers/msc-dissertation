["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Firstly, we need to identify the relevant documents that contain information about steroid-based molecules. Upon reviewing the provided documents, we find mentions of beta-sitosterol (I) and 24-ethylcholesterol(VI) in [Chemical constituents of Morinda officinalis How]. These names suggest that they are steroid-based molecules.\n\nNext, we identify I as testosterone and III as progesterone, both being steroid-based hormones.\n\nFinally, since II refers to triglycerides which are not steroid-based, we eliminate this option. Similarly, IV refers to DNA which is a nucleic acid, also not a steroid-based molecule.\n\nBased on the information provided, the correct answer is\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C: I and III\""]
