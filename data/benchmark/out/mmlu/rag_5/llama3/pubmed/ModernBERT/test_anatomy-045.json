["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the development of the bones of the viscerocranium. After reviewing the provided documents, I found that none of them specifically discuss the development of the viscerocranium. However, one document does mention the articulus mandibulae, which is part of the viscerocranium. The article '[About the face value of the cleft of the articulus mandibulae (author's transl)]' discusses the planimetry of negative replicas on the mandibular joints from older men, but it doesn't provide information on the development of the bones. Therefore, I will focus on general knowledge about the development of the viscerocranium.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C\n}"]
