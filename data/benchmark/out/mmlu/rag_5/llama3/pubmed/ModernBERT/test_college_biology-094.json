["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the src oncogene. The provided documents mention DNA-PK (DNA-activated protein kinase) as a serine/threonine protein kinase regulated by DNA. This information is unrelated to the src oncogene. The next document discusses RNA polymerase, which is not directly related to the src oncogene either. The third document talks about bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase and its mutants. However, it does not provide any information about the src oncogene. The fourth document discusses protein-DNA interactions and binding parameters, but this topic is also unrelated to the src oncogene.\n\nThe src oncogene is a well-known gene that codes for a tyrosine kinase. Therefore, based on our knowledge of the src oncogene, we can conclude that it encodes for Tyrosine kinase.\n\nAnswer: D\", \n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
