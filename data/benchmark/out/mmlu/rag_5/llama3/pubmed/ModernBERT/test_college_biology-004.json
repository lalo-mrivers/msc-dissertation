["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about synthesizing an RNA/DNA hybrid from a single-stranded RNA template. The relevant information comes from the 'Identification of Sendai virus mRNA species' document, which mentions that cell-free translation of separated Sendai virus mRNA species identified the message for polypeptide M and suggested the identity of the message for polypeptide NP. This suggests that there is a process involved in translating an RNA template into DNA. The 'Chemical-enzymatic synthesis and cloning of the full-length genome of a DNA-containing plant virus' document also provides information about synthesizing the full-length genomic DNA of a small plant virus, which involves chemical synthesis, ligation and polymerase chain reaction.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
