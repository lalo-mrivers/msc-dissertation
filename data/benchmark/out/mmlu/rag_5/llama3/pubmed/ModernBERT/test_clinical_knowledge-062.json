["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking what commonly causes skin excoriation. Looking at the provided documents, we can see that there are no direct mentions of skin excoriation in the context of the male face lift, factitious pseudoainhum of the nipple, genetic disorders of the skin and eye, or schistosomiasis of spinal cord and skin. However, the document on [Rare variation of the cubital artery] does not seem relevant to the question either.\\n\\nOne possible connection can be made with the concept of stoma care as mentioned in some of the documents. Factitious pseudoainhum is a condition where a person creates their own lesions by scratching or rubbing them. Similarly, ostomy patients may experience skin excoriation due to poor pouching technique.\\n\\nIn this context, option C: Leakage of effluent onto peristomal skin seems the most plausible cause of skin excoriation.\\n\\nTherefore, I will choose option C as the answer.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"]
