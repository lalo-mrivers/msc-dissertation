["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the circulation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) around the brain. The document on fenestration of the epithelium lining the roof of the fourth cerebral ventricle in amphibia states that numerous pores occur between ependymal cells, permitting bulk flow of CSF out of the ventricular system into the subarachnoid space. This suggests that CSF circulates between the arachnoid and pia maters. The document on prevention of experimental obstructions in the retinal microcirculation also supports this idea, as it discusses platelet aggregates lodging in retina vessels, which implies that CSF is circulating around the brain.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"]
