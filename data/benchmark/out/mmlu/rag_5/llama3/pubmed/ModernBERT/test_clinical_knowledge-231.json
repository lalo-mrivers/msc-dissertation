["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the first fibre types to fatigue during intense exercise like sprinting. The relevant documents provided don't specifically discuss muscle fibers or their fatigue patterns. However, we can look for information related to exercise and physiology. In 'Developmental Imperatives in the Latter Half of Life', it mentions men tend to shift from active to passive mastery in the latter half of life, which implies they may not be as physically active during this period. This doesn't directly relate to muscle fibers but suggests that people's physical abilities change with age.\n\nIn 'Icarus's Syndrome', there is no information about muscle fibers or fatigue patterns during exercise. The document primarily discusses hang gliding accidents and the importance of proper instruction.\n\nThe 'An Innovation in Testing' document talks about a testing method used in teaching at all levels, but it doesn't provide any relevant information about muscle fibers or their behavior during intense exercise.\n\nLastly, 'The Panisset-Pop Syndrome' describes a syndrome occurring in people learning fundus photography, which is not related to muscle fibers or exercise. Therefore, we can focus on the general concepts of physiology and exercise discussed in 'Developmental Imperatives in the Latter Half of Life'.\n\nGiven that Type I fibres are primarily used for low-intensity, long-duration activities like distance running, they would be more resistant to fatigue. On the other hand, Type II fibres are used for high-intensity, short-duration activities like sprinting and tend to fatigue faster.\n\nBased on this information, it's likely that Type II fibres would be the first to fatigue during all-out exercise such as sprinting.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: Type IIX fibres.\""]
