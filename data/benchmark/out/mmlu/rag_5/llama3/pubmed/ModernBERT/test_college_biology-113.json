["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question states that the rate of reduction of acetaldehyde to ethanol increases as the concentration of acetaldehyde is increased until it reaches a maximum. This suggests that the reaction has reached saturation. At this point, further increases in the concentration of acetaldehyde would not affect the rate of the reaction because all enzyme molecules are already interacting with acetaldehyde molecules.\",\n\"answer_choice\": A"]
