["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the ATP store in muscle. The provided documents mention creatine kinase (CPK) variations during exercise. According to the document 'Continuous in vivo measurement of creatine kinase variations in man during an exercise', CPK was measured continuously in 5 physically fit athletes exercised on an ergometric bicycle for 30 min, and there was practically no increase in enzymatic activity. This suggests that the ATP store in muscle can only supply energy for a certain period.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
