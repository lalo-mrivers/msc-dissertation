["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents suggest that the placenta participates in metabolism of amino acids for fetal needs. Amino acid nutrition across the placenta suggests that leucine, glutamine, glutamate, serine, and glycine are provided by the placenta through metabolism rather than simple transport. This implies that the placenta has a metabolic function, which is consistent with the transport of free fatty acids as lipoproteins. Furthermore, the question about the transport of free fatty acids in blood does not mention glucose or albumin, making choice C and D less likely. Therefore, it is most likely that most of the free fatty acids are transported in the blood as lipoproteins.\", \"answer_choice\": B}"]
