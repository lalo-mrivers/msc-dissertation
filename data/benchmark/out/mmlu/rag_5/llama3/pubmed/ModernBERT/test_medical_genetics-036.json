["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Since the question asks about a condition that shows anticipation in paternal transmission, I will focus on conditions that exhibit anticipation. Anticipation is a phenomenon where the severity or age of onset of a genetic disorder increases with each subsequent generation. After reviewing the provided documents, I did not find any information related to Familial 21/22 translocation, Marfan syndrome, or Cystic fibrosis and paternal transmission anticipation.\n\nI will therefore focus on Huntington disease, which is a well-known example of a condition that shows anticipation in paternal transmission.
