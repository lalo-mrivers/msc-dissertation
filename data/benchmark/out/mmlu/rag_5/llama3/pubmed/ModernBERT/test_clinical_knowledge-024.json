["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about processes that modify protein structure after translation has occurred. Lipidation is the attachment of lipids to proteins, which can occur after translation. Attachment of more amino acids via peptide bonds refers to protein synthesis or elongation, which occurs during translation. Glycosylation is the attachment of carbohydrates to proteins, which can also occur post-translationally. Phosphorylation is the addition of phosphate groups to proteins, which can be a post-translational modification. Therefore, among the given options, B: Attachment of more amino acids via peptide bonds is not used to modify protein structure after translation has occurred.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
