["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks when a muscle fibre relaxes. From the given documents, none of them directly answer this question. However, 'Sarcomere shortening and tension development during 'isometric' tetanus of muscle.' mentions that sarcomeres contract more rapidly than tension develops during isometric tetanus. This implies that muscle fibers do not relax immediately after stimulation. The other documents appear to be unrelated to the relaxation of muscle fibers. Therefore, the answer must be related to the removal of nerve stimulus.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
