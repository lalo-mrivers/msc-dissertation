["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Xeroderma pigmentosum is a recessive autosomal disease characterized by a high prevalence of skin cancers. It's caused by defective DNA repair, specifically the inability to repair ultraviolet damage to DNA. The relevant document '[DNA repair and related diseases]' explains that defective DNA-repair is caused by mutations involving genes which encode the enzymes responsible for recognition and excision of DNA lesions. In individuals with XP, this means they are unable to repair thymine dimers caused by exposure to UV radiation. Therefore, we can conclude that Thymine dimers are most likely to accrue in individuals with XP.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
