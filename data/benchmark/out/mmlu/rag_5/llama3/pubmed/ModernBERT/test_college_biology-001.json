["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking when a frameshift mutation is created. A frameshift mutation occurs when there's an insertion or deletion of one or more nucleotides in a sequence of DNA. This changes the reading frame of the genetic code, resulting in a different amino acid sequence than originally intended. The options provided are: telomeric sequences being removed from DNA (A), a codon's nucleotide sequence changing to produce a different amino acid (B), or a base pair being inserted or deleted in a gene (C). Option D talks about a stop codon, but that's not related to frameshift mutations. Based on the definition of a frameshift mutation, option C is the correct answer.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
