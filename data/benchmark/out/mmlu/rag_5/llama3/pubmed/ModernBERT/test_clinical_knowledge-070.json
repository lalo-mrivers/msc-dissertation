["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"After reviewing the provided documents, I did not find any information specifically related to removing adhesive strips. Therefore, I will focus on general principles of wound care. Adhesive strips are commonly used in wound dressing and removal usually requires gentle traction to avoid pulling off surrounding skin.
