["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"After analyzing the provided documents, none of them seem to be directly related to a palpable left parasternal impulse. However, I'll look for key terms or phrases that could help me find the answer. One document caught my attention - [Contribution to the therapy of epiphora (author's transl)]. Although it doesn't seem relevant at first glance, the phrase 'fold of the conjunctiva' made me think about other possibilities. Then I noticed [Luxatio pedis subtalo], which talks about a dislocation. Dislocations are not typically related to cardiac issues either. However, I'm still searching for any potential connection. The next document is [A rare form of oscillation]. Although it discusses fetal distress and CTG's, it doesn't seem relevant. The last document is [Unusual case of fire-arm injury], which describes a firearm-injury and its consequences. Still nothing that stands out as related to the palpable left parasternal impulse. Finally, I'll look at the question again: 'A palpable left parasternal impulse suggests which abnormality?' Based on my step-by-step thinking process, I believe the answer is A: Right ventricular hypertrophy.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
