["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The provided documents are a collection of medical-related texts from various authors. The question asks about the epigenetic inheritance system described by Mayr and Provine (1980). To answer this question, I will need to find relevant information that connects the given texts to this concept. After reviewing the texts, I found that none of them directly mention the epigenetic inheritance system or its description. However, one text mentions 'soft inheritance' which could be a possible connection. Upon further analysis, I found that 'soft inheritance' is actually a term coined by Stephen Jay Gould (1977) to describe the idea that acquired characteristics can be passed on through generations. This concept is closely related to the epigenetic inheritance system. Therefore, I will focus on this term as it might provide a connection to the question.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
