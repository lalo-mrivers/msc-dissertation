["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about what is embedded in the inner membrane of the mitochondrion. The relevant document is [High resolution NMR study of mitochondria and submitochondrial fragments]. This paper discusses the PMR spectra of different parts of the mitochondrion, including the inner membranes. There is no mention of glycogen molecules or triacylglycerol molecules in this document, which eliminates choices C and D. The electron transport chain is a component of the mitochondrial electron transport system, which is embedded in the inner membrane of the mitochondrion. This matches choice B.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
