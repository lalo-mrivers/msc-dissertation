["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about determining whether CMV DNA is present in the patient's blood. The technician uses a mixture containing oligonucleotides specific for CMV DNA, thermostable DNA polymerase, and nucleotides, followed by repetitive cycles of heating and cooling, and then detects the reaction product by gel electrophoresis. This process is similar to the one described in the 'Polymerase chain reaction-based detection of Trypanosoma cruzi DNA in serum' document, where oligonucleotide primers anneal specifically to a highly repetitive sequence of Trypanosoma cruzi nuclear DNA, and the product is amplified by polymerase chain reaction. Therefore, it is likely that the technician used Polymerase Chain Reaction (B) on this patient's blood.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
