["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the likelihood of an individual carrying two specific alleles of a human DNA marker. The frequency of each allele is 0.2. We can use the Hardy-Weinberg law to solve this problem. According to the Hardy-Weinberg law, the frequency of homozygous dominant (aa) and heterozygous (Aa) individuals can be calculated using the frequencies of the two alleles. Since we are interested in the likelihood of an individual carrying two specific alleles, we need to calculate the probability of getting both A and a alleles.\n\nThe probability of getting AA is 0.2 x 0.2 = 0.04 (since the probability of getting one A allele is 0.2 and the other A allele is also 0.2).\nThe probability of getting Aa is 2 x 0.2 x 0.8 = 0.32 (since the probability of getting one A allele is 0.2 and the other allele is a, which has frequency 0.8).\n\nSince we are interested in the likelihood of an individual carrying two specific alleles, we need to add the probabilities of AA and Aa: 0.04 + 0.32 = 0.36.\n\nHowever, this answer is not among the provided options. The closest option is B: 0.32, which represents the probability of getting Aa only.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
