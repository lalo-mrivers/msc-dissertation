["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about what keeps blood flowing between contractions of the left ventricle. The relevant documents describe various circulatory phenomena. In the first document, it mentions that the venous component of a coronary arteriovenous fistula combines into a single channel that empties into the left ventricle. This implies that there is continued flow into the left ventricle even between its contractions. The second and third documents describe autoregulatory responses in specific arteries, which suggests that these vessels can regulate their own blood flow independently of changes in systemic blood pressure or cardiac contraction. Finally, the fourth document shows that lung inflation has no effect on heart rate or total peripheral resistance during cardiopulmonary bypass, implying that there is some inherent mechanism maintaining blood flow. Given these points, it seems likely that the answer lies not with the atria, vessels, right ventricle, or external factors.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
