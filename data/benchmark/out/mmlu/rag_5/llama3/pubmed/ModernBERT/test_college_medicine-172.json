["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the provided documents, I know that the etiology of Meni√®re's attacks involves the rupture of the membranous labyrinth with diffusion of potassium into the perilymph. Additionally, the characteristics of the functional organization of the kidney medullary substance in desert birds show that there is an increase in sodium from the renal cortex to medulla due to the countercurrent multiplication of the medulla and Henle's loops. Given this information, I can infer that the descending loop of Henle of the nephron of the kidney is related to sodium transport. Therefore, the permeability of the descending loop of Henle should be related to sodium.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
