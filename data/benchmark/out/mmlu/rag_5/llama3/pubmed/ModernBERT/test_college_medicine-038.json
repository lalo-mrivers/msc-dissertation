["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about another process of muscle contraction that requires ATP, aside from the power stroke. The power stroke is the movement of myosin heads towards actin during muscle contraction. According to the provided documents, the return of myosin heads to thick filaments after muscle contraction also requires ATP and occurs in two stages: rapid return of most myosin heads followed by slow return of the rest. Therefore, the correct answer is D: Myosin-actin detachment.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
