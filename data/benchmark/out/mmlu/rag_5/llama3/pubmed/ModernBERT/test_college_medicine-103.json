["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe various types of mutations, including insertional mutations in transgenic mice, spontaneous petite mutants in yeast, and DNA double-strand breaks induced by restriction enzymes. The question states that mutations are errors in DNA, which implies a change in the DNA sequence. This can occur spontaneously or be induced by external factors such as carcinogens. There is no information provided to support the claims that mutations are always harmful, only occur in the presence of carcinogens, or increase tumour growth. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that mutations occur spontaneously at a low rate.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
