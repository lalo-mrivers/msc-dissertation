["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the location of proprioceptive receptors providing information about the position of the Temporomandibular Joint (TMJ). Based on the provided documents, we know that the TMJ is mentioned in the context of the temporomandibular joint: some biological considerations. This document discusses the physiological mechanisms operating through the temporomandibular joint in the perception of changes in the position of the mandible. From this information, it can be inferred that the proprioceptive receptors providing information about the position of the TMJ are located in structures related to the TMJ.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
