["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the type of system that rational choice theory is premised on. Rational choice theory assumes that actions are chosen based on the benefit to the individual. The three main assumptions of this theory are completeness, transitivity, and independence of variables. These assumptions suggest a framework for understanding human decision-making, but do not explicitly describe the organization or structure of the system. Therefore, we should look at the relevant documents to find a description that matches these assumptions.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
