["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to the document [Morphological specifications on the anatomy of the vagus nerve in the mediastinum], it is mentioned that 'the intrathoracic vagosympathetic relations in man are discussed, and attention is drawn to certain small nerve branches connecting the orthosympathetic ant the hypobronchial portion of the oesophageal plexus.' This suggests that the parasympathetic preganglionic nerves may be associated with the vagus nerve. Additionally, the vagus nerve is also mentioned in the document [Remarks concerning a case of oculogyric crisis (author's transl)] as being related to the mesencephalic reticular system. Based on this information, it can be inferred that the parasympathetic preganglionic nerves likely leave the central nervous system with the vagus nerve.\", \"answer_choice\": D}"]
