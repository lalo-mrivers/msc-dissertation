["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the process of pioneer species colonizing a bare substrate. The relevant documents mention coastal phenomena, pollution, and aquatic ecosystems, but none of them directly address the colonization of a bare substrate. However, one document mentions 'ecologic concepts' that can aid in understanding the various modes of disturbance of aquatic ecosystems. This suggests that primary succession might be related to the process being described. Primary succession occurs when pioneer species colonize a bare substrate such as rock, sand, or glacial till.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
