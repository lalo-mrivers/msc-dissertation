["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about a fundamental cause of fatigue in high intensity exercise. We need to find an answer that explains why fatigue occurs in such situations. Looking at the provided documents, we see that none of them directly address this specific topic. However, based on our knowledge of physiology, fatigue can be attributed to the inability of the ATP supply to match the demand during high-intensity exercise. This is because high-intensity exercise requires a rapid replenishment of ATP stores, which can lead to fatigue if not met.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
