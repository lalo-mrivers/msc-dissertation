["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"After reviewing the provided documents, I did not find any information that directly relates to the question about human somatic cells. The documents discuss molecular weights of haptens, a new method for estimating population doubling time of vertebrate cells, measurement of an inhibitory zone, unusual XX/XY chimerism in twins, and DNA analysis of rat brain nuclei.
