["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, there is no mention of a 'Colles fracture' or any related information. However, since it's an orthopedic-related term, I'll assume it's likely to be described in a document that focuses on fractures. The relevant documents are: [What is your diagnosis] (craniomandibular osteopathy) and [Pelvimetry (author's transl)] (pelvimetry). Since neither of these documents mention 'Colles fracture', the information must be found elsewhere. Unfortunately, there is no other document that describes this specific type of fracture.\", \"answer_choice\": D}"]
