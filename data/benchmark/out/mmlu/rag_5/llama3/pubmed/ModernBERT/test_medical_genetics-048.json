["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the proportion of genes shared by first cousins. To answer this, we need to understand the concept of heredity and gene flow within a population. From the given documents, we can see that there are studies on familial 21/22 translocation, Norway rat haemoglobin phenotypes, multivariate studies on dermal ridges, unifactorially inherited attributes of the Holy Island population, and familial pericentric inversion of chromosome 1. These studies demonstrate different aspects of heredity, such as Mendelian inheritance patterns, genetic polymorphisms, and factor analysis. However, none of these documents directly address the proportion of genes shared by first cousins. To answer this question, we need to rely on general knowledge of human genetics or consult other relevant sources. For simplicity, let's assume that first cousins share an average of 1/8 of their genes, which is a reasonable estimate based on Mendelian inheritance patterns.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
