["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about a ventricular septal defect (VSD), which is a hole in the septum between the right and left ventricles. This means that oxygen-rich blood from the left ventricle can flow into the right ventricle through the VSD, mixing with the oxygen-poor blood in the right ventricle. Since the right ventricle pumps blood to the lungs to pick up oxygen, this mixture of oxygen-rich and oxygen-poor blood would lead to a decrease in overall oxygen levels in the right ventricle.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
