["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about hypovolaemic shock, which is a condition where the blood volume is significantly reduced. The changes in heart rate and blood pressure are usually the first signs of this condition. Upon reviewing the provided documents, I found that they do not directly address hypovolaemic shock or provide specific information on the percentage of blood loss before it affects heart rate and blood pressure. However, we can consider the concept of sympathetic drive to the heart in myocardial infarction (Paper 1) and the effects of insulin on heart rate (Paper 3). These concepts suggest that an increase in sympathetic activity or a compensatory response to maintain cardiac output may not be immediate when there is only a small reduction in blood volume. Therefore, I believe that a significant amount of blood loss would be required before it affects heart rate and blood pressure.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
