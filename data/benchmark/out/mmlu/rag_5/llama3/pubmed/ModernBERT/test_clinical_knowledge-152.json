["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the type of covalent bonds that link amino acids in a protein. The relevant documents mention different types of interactions between amino groups (in polyethyleneimine) and phosphate moieties (binding at N-termini of helices). There is no mention of glycosidic bonds, which are typically found in carbohydrates, not proteins. Ionic bonds are typically formed between ions with opposite charges, whereas peptides have a neutral charge. Therefore, the most likely option is Peptide bonds.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
