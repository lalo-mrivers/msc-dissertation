["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the products of ADP degradation that increase in concentration in the blood during multiple sprint sports. First, we need to identify what happens to ADP during this type of activity. We can find this information by looking at the relevant documents. In [The effect of ADP on platelet metabolism in vitro.-III-], it is mentioned that ADP induces an apparent platelets protrusion by rat's megakaryocytes in vitro, which suggests that ADP plays a role in platelet activation. This implies that during multiple sprint sports, ADP is likely to be released and degraded into its products.\n\nNext, we need to identify what these products are. We can find this information by looking at the other documents. In [The existence of a thrombocyte refractory state], it is mentioned that ADP degradation products do not include ammonia, as an inhibitory action of excess adenosine or ADP breakdown in plasma could not account for the phenomenon.\n\nTherefore, we are left with urea and uric acid as possible products. Finally, we can check if these products increase in concentration during multiple sprint sports. Unfortunately, this information is not provided in any of the documents, but based on our knowledge of exercise physiology, it is likely that ATP (adenosine triphosphate) is broken down into ADP and then further degraded into its products during intense physical activity.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that the correct answer is B: Ammonia, urea and uric acid.\", \"answer_choice\": B}"]
