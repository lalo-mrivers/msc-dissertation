["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Since the patient is cyanosed, it implies that there is a decrease in oxygen saturation. The provided documents don't explicitly mention specific values for oxygen saturation levels. However, we can make an educated guess based on the information available. We know that inert gases like helium can increase oxygen consumption, and it's mentioned that animals exhibit increased oxygen consumption of liver tissue after 1-hour exposure to helium-oxygen mixtures. This suggests that there might be a decrease in oxygen saturation.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C: 80% or below\"\n}"]
