["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about adaptations that would limit pollination by bees and promote hummingbird pollination. Bee pollination is generally associated with flowers having patterns of ultraviolet color on the petals (A), which are invisible to humans but visible to bees. Hummingbirds, on the other hand, are attracted to nectar-rich flowers with red or orange colors. Therefore, we can rule out options B and C, as they would not have a direct impact on pollination methods. Option D suggests that limiting the availability of nectar would promote hummingbird pollination, which aligns with our understanding of hummingbirds' behavior.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
