["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the tissues and tissue regions that a stem-boring beetle larva would encounter as it eats its way from the center of the wood twig to the outside. The epidermis has already fallen off, so we can focus on the internal structures.\n\nThe pith is at the very center of the twig, surrounded by primary xylem. As the larva moves outward, it will likely encounter secondary xylem, which forms the bulk of the wood's thickness.\n\nNext, the larva may reach the vascular cambium, a thin layer that produces new xylem and phloem tissue. This is followed by the primary phloem, which carries nutrients produced in the leaves to the rest of the tree.\n\nFinally, as the larva approaches the outside of the twig, it will encounter secondary phloem and cortex, the outer layers of the twig.\n\nThe order from inside to outside is: pith, primary xylem, secondary xylem, vascular cambium, primary phloem, and finally secondary phloem and cortex.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
