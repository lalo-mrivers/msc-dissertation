["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the tissues with the highest rate of oxygen production in an actively photosynthesizing plant. The provided documents do not directly answer this question, but they give us information about the environment and biological processes that can help us make an educated guess. Since the pre-biotic atmosphere was heavily reducing, it suggests that the Earth's atmosphere was devoid of oxygen at one point in its history. This implies that photosynthesis would have produced little to no oxygen. On the other hand, the documents do not mention anything about the rate of oxygen production in different plant tissues. The study on haemoglobins and thermodynamic analysis seem unrelated to this question. However, the study on Bacillus species provides information about optimal temperature conditions for enzyme synthesis, which is not directly applicable here. Finally, we have a document discussing membrane oxygenator devices, which seems completely unrelated to plant biology and oxygen production.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
