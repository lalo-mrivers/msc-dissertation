["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has a sudden drop in blood pressure since the operation. Given the operative findings of 200 mL blood loss and no significant bleeding from the nasogastric tube, it is unlikely that the problem is due to external hemorrhage. The hematocrit has decreased by 11 points, indicating significant blood loss. The patient's vital signs suggest a state of hypovolemic shock, which can be caused by internal bleeding. Based on the patient's history of hypertension and coronary artery disease, it is unlikely that cardiac tamponade would cause this set of findings. Given the operative site and the patient's medical history, damage to the middle colic artery or epigastric artery is a more likely explanation for these findings.\", \"answer_choice\": D}"]
