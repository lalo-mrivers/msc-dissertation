["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the expected frequency of affected females given the frequency of males affected with an X-linked recessive condition is 0.10 (one in ten). The relevant document for this problem is [Estimation of the frequency of recessive X-chromosome-associated traits among females]. This article shows that the estimation of the frequency, in any population, of female carriers of recessive conditions associated with the X chromosome is possible when the frequency of the affection among men is known. The expected proportions under various conditions are shown in the formulae.\n\nLet's use the formula to solve this problem: Let 'p' be the frequency of males affected with an X-linked recessive condition, and let 'q' be the frequency of affected females. We know that p = 0.10 (one in ten). Since the gene is X-linked recessive, the carrier females are not affected.\n\nUsing the formula from the article, we can write: q/p = 1\n\nSo, q = p = 0.10\n\nThis means that the expected frequency of affected females is also 0.10\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
