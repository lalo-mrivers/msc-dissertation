["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The protein is synthesized on cytoplasmic ribosomes, which means it starts its journey outside the chloroplast. It then needs to cross the outer membrane of the chloroplast and enter the stroma (the fluid-filled region inside the chloroplast). From there, it must cross the thylakoid membrane into the lumen where it is finally located. Therefore, the protein crosses three membranes: one from the cytoplasm to the outside of the chloroplast, one from the stroma to the thylakoid, and one from the stroma (again) to the lumen.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
