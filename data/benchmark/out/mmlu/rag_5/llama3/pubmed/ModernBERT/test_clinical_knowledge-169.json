["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks which nucleotide base is not found in RNA. The relevant information comes from the document 'How many anticodons? Much new information on codon composition is becoming available from the sequencing of molecules of DNA and RNA.' It states that 'A is not found in the first position of anticodons'. This implies that adenine (A) is present in RNA, but only in positions other than the first. Therefore, we can eliminate option B: Adenine as a correct answer.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
