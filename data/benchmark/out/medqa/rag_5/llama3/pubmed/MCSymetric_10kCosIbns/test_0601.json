["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the pattern of glutamate release from presynaptic nerve terminals. According to the provided documents, glutamate is released through ligand-gated ion channels (LGIQs) in response to stimulation of Schaffer collateral fibers. This is supported by the findings that microiontophoretic application of glutamate strongly decreased the primary positive component of the commissural EP, with a parallel enhancement of the negativity, and that glutamate considerably increased the deep commissural response in the stratum radiatum.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D\n}"]
