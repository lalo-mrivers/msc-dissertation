["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has a 3-week history of colicky abdominal pain and diarrhea. He has bowel movements 10-12 times daily, with blood and mucus in the stool, and constant urge to defecate. The vital signs are normal, but the abdomen shows diffuse tenderness to palpation. The serum concentration of C-reactive protein is 20 mg/L, which suggests an inflammatory process. The colonoscopy shows a bleeding, ulcerated rectal mucosa with several pseudopolyps. Given these findings, the patient's symptoms and physical examination are more consistent with an inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) than with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Within the context of IBD, the presence of bleeding, ulcers, and pseudopolyps suggests a diagnosis of ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease. The risk factors for developing one of these conditions include a history of chronic diarrhea, abdominal pain, and rectal bleeding.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
