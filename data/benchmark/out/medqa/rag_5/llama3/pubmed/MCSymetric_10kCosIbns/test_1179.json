["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient was unrestrained during a head-on collision. He presented to the emergency department with no significant fractures or injuries found. Four months later, he presents with weakness in his upper extremities and reduced sensation. This suggests that the injury may have occurred at the time of the accident. The fact that his lower extremities are unaffected and show normal strength and sensation suggests a localized injury. Given the mechanism of injury and the patient's symptoms, I think it is most likely that the patient has sustained an injury to the upper portion of their body, possibly due to direct occupant-to-occupant contact or one occupant forcing another into or against one or more interior car structures.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
