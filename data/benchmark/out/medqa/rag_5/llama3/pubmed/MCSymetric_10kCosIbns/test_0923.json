["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about a 53-year-old man with chronic shoulder pain that worsened after straining his shoulder during a pick-up basketball game. We are looking for a functional maneuver that would be deficient on physical exam if the patient has torn his supraspinatus. According to the documents, activity with an elevated arm is a risk factor for reduced local flow of blood to the supraspinatus muscle. This suggests that the supraspinatus muscle is involved in activities that require elevation of the arm. The prone position was shown to produce significantly greater EMG activity than the standing test position, indicating that this position may be beneficial for testing and rehabilitation of the supraspinatus.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C: Initiation of abduction\""]
