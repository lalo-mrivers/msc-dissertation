["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with subacute back pain that is constant and worse at night. The past medical history suggests a significant risk of metastatic disease to the spine. The physical exam reveals point tenderness along the lumbosacral area, which could be due to a sacroiliac joint problem or a vertebral column issue. Given the patient's age and medical history, it is more likely that the pain is related to a vertebral column issue rather than a hip or lower extremity problem.\n\nThe relevant documents suggest that visceral diseases can cause lumbar syndromes (Visceral diseases as cause of lumbar syndromes). The patient's past medical history of non-small cell lung cancer and successful treatment suggests that there could be metastatic disease to the spine. Therefore, it is possible that the pain is related to vertebral column involvement.\n\nThe document on investigation of the relation between low back pain and occupation (Investigation of the relation between low back pain and occupation) highlights the importance of a thorough neuro-orthopedic examination in patients with LBP. However, this patient's symptoms do not suggest hip or lower extremity pathology.\n\nGiven these factors, it is possible that the most likely imaging finding would be related to vertebral column involvement. The document on epidemiology, etiology, diagnostic evaluation, and treatment of low back pain (Epidemiology, etiology, diagnostic evaluation, and treatment of low back pain) suggests that sacral insufficiency fractures are a significant cause of back pain in elderly individuals with predisposing disorders.\n\nConsidering these factors, the most likely imaging finding would be related to vertebral column involvement. The document on visceral diseases as cause of lumbar syndromes suggests that radiographic techniques can help detect anatomic abnormalities associated with clinical disorders including inflammatory myelitis.\n\nIn this patient's case, it is possible that the PET scan 1 year ago demonstrated no recurrence of non-small cell lung cancer, but it does not rule out metastatic disease to the spine. Therefore, the most likely imaging finding would be related to vertebral column involvement.\n\nThe potential choices include:\n\n* A: Bulging disc impinging on lumbar spinal nerve (unrelated to visceral diseases or vertebral column involvement)\n* B: Lytic lesions of the lumbar spine (possible metastatic disease to the spine)\n* C: Narrowing of the lumbar disc space (not related to visceral diseases or vertebral column involvement)\n* D: Sacroilitis and fusion of the lumbar spine (unlikely given the patient's age and medical history)\n\nGiven these factors, the most likely imaging finding would be B: Lytic lesions of the lumbar spine.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
