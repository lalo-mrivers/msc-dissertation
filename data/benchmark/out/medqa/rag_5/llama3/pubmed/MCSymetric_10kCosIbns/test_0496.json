["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms suggest a central nervous system disturbance. The laboratory results show hypernatremia (serum sodium 148 mEq/L). This is an unusual presentation of hypernatremia, as the patient does not appear to be dehydrated. The urine osmolality suggests that the kidneys are able to concentrate urine normally. Reviewing the relevant documents, we see a case of recurrent hypernatremia in a 7-year-old girl with absence of thirst and abnormal excretion of water. This is similar to our patient's presentation. We also have a case of essential hypernatremia due to an elevated 'osmotic set point' for the release of antidiuretic hormone.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C: Decreased antidiuretic hormone secretion\""]
