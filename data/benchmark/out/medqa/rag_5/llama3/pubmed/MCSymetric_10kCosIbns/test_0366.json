["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 28-year-old female with episodic chest pain described as squeezing and tightness. She has no association of the pain with food or exercise. The EKG in the office is normal, but 24-hour ECG monitoring shows transient ST elevations during the episodes of pain that resolve completely. This suggests a non-myocardial origin for the chest pain. Given the patient's age, lack of risk factors for coronary artery disease, and normal EKG, it's unlikely to be related to myocardial infarction or aortic dissection. Costochondritis is also an unlikely cause given the patient's normal physical examination. Raynaud's phenomenon could be a possibility, but it typically affects the hands and feet, not the chest.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
