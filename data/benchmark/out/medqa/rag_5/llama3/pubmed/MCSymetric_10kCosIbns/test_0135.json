["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks to identify the primary function of the protein bound to CD8. From the documents, we know that CD8 is a T-cell co-receptor that binds to HLA class I molecules presenting antigenic peptides. The documents also describe the interactions between CD8 and different cell types, including HIV-infected cells. Given these contexts, it seems likely that the protein identified as bound to CD8 would be involved in antigen presentation or recognition. Option C, which states that the protein binds endogenous peptides transported by the TAP channel, is the most relevant.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
