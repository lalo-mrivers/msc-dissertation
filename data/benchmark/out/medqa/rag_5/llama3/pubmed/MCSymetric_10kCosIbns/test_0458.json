["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Upon reviewing the provided documents, I noticed that changes in heart rate are discussed in several studies. In 'Cardiac responses of young women to conditioning for a 10 kilometer race', it is mentioned that maximum heart rate reserve was used as the training intensity (80-85%). This suggests that the sympathetic nervous system plays a role in increasing heart rate during exercise.\n\nIn 'Effect of prolonged running on physiological responses to subsequent exercise', it is noted that submaximal heart rate responses were higher after prolonged running. This could be attributed to the activation of the sympathetic nervous system, which increases heart rate and cardiac output.\n\nIn 'Thermal and circulatory responses to repeated bouts of prolonged running', it is observed that rectal temperature and heart rate increase during each bout of prolonged running, with a higher response in the second bout. Again, this suggests an increase in sympathetic activity.\n\nConsidering these findings, it appears that the most likely explanation for the change in the individual's heart rate and blood pressure is an increase in sympathetic nervous system activation.\", \"answer_choice\": C}"]
