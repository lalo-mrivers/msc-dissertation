["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is presenting with symptoms of anxiety and depression. He has a history of substance abuse, but currently denies smoking or alcohol use. His symptoms include feelings of nervousness and anxiety, restlessness, racing thoughts that keep him up at night, heart racing, feeling light-headed and dizzy to the point of blacking out, and back and neck pain with increased muscle tension. Given his history of addiction, it's likely that he may have underlying depression or trauma contributing to his symptoms.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe patient is experiencing physical symptoms such as pain and muscle tension, which suggests a need for a medication that can address both the anxiety and the pain. The patient's age also plays a role in selecting the most appropriate treatment option.\\r\\n\\r\\nBased on these factors, the best course of treatment would be to prescribe a benzodiazepine such as Alprazolam (D) or Diazepam (A). Both medications have been shown to be effective in treating anxiety and can also help with sleep disturbances. Additionally, they are commonly used in the management of withdrawal symptoms from substances like cocaine and heroin.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile Ramelteon (B) is an agent approved for insomnia, it's not typically used for anxiety or pain management. Buspirone (C) is primarily used for anxiety disorders, but its effects may be less pronounced compared to benzodiazepines in this patient's case.\", \"answer_choice\": D}"]
