["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the expression of HIF-1a under normoxic conditions in renal cell carcinoma. According to the documents provided, HIF-1a is a transcription factor that is degraded by proteasomal degradation in normoxia due to its hydroxylation by VHL protein. However, under hypoxic conditions, this degradation pathway is inhibited and HIF-1a escapes degradation, dimerizes with HIF-1ÃŸ, and translocates to the nucleus to regulate hypoxic response elements.\n\nGiven that renal cell carcinoma can mimic the hypoxic state to promote angiogenesis by inhibiting HIF-1a hydroxylation even in normoxia, it is expected that HIF-1a will be present in RCC under normoxic conditions. Therefore, a Western blot or Northern blot can be used to detect HIF-1a in RCC cells.\n\nA Southern blot is not relevant to this experiment as it is used for detecting specific DNA sequences and has no direct relation to protein expression like Western blot or mRNA expression like Northern blot.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
