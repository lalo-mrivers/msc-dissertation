["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking why capsular polysaccharides are conjugated to protein carriers during vaccine development. The passage mentions that bacterial polysaccharides elicit protective antibodies in adults but fail to produce an augmented response or promote antibody class switching, whereas T-cell-dependent antigens typically produce boosted antibody levels and promote antibody class switching. Therefore, the conjugation of polysaccharide antigens to protein carriers likely aims to convert the T-cell-independent polysaccharide antigens into T-cell-dependent antigens, which would improve the immune response.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
