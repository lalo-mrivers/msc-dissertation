["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's younger brother has mild developmental delay, pale complexion, and requires a diet limited by phenylalanine due to a genetic disorder. This suggests that the brother is affected with Phenylketonuria (PKU), which is an autosomal recessive disorder. Since the patient does not have any similar symptoms and is in good health, she is likely to be a carrier of the disease, as carriers are often healthy but can pass the mutated gene to their offspring.\n\nThe parents' health also suggests that they do not carry the mutated gene or may be carriers who are not affected by the disorder. Since the patient's younger brother has the classic symptoms of PKU, it is likely that he is homozygous for the mutated gene, and his parents are either both carriers or one carrier and one non-carrier.\n\nThe mode of inheritance in this case is autosomal recessive, which means that an individual must inherit two copies of the mutated gene (one from each parent) to be affected by the disorder. As a carrier, the patient has one copy of the mutated gene and one normal copy, making her susceptible to passing the mutated gene to her offspring.\n\nBased on this information, it is most likely that the patient is a carrier of PKU, with a risk of 100% for passing the mutated gene to each child. This would mean that any child she has will have a 25% chance (1/4) of being affected by PKU and a 50% chance (1/2) of being a carrier like her.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B\n}"]
