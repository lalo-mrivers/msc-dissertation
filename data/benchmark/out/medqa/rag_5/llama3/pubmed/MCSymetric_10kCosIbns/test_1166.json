["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 15-year-old girl who has been experiencing worsening grades since starting high school. She also has difficulty making friends and fears that her classmates will make fun of her if she makes a mistake. During a presentation, she experienced physical symptoms such as a racing heart and flushing. Since then, she avoids speaking up in class and spends breaks alone in the restroom due to anxiety. Physical and neurologic examinations show no abnormalities.\n\nThe patient's symptoms are consistent with social anxiety disorder (SAD), which is characterized by excessive and persistent fear of being judged or evaluated by others. The avoidance of eye contact on mental status examination also suggests SAD.\n\nPhenelzine is an MAOI, which can be used to treat SAD. However, due to the potential for serious side effects, it is not a first-line treatment.\n\nFluoxetine (Prozac) is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) that has been shown to be effective in treating social anxiety disorder. It is often used as a first-line treatment.\n\nClomipramine and propranolol are not typically used to treat SAD, so they can be eliminated from the list of options.\n\nBased on the patient's symptoms and the available treatment options, the most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient would be Fluoxetine (Prozac).\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
