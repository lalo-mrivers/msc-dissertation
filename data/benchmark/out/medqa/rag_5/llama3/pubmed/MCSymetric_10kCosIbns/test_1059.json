["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about a chronic opioid abuser who undergoes emergency surgery and is started on patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) to control pain. The patient reports intense pain 6 hours after the conclusion of the surgery, indicating that the PCA may not be effective in controlling his pain. To reduce the risk of developing postoperative hyperalgesia, an agent could have been given intraoperatively. Opioids are commonly used for anesthesia induction and maintenance, but they can also produce unpredictable anesthesia, poor muscle relaxation, prolonged onset, and relatively difficult intubation. The question does not specify what type of surgery was performed, so we cannot assume that the patient was undergoing a major surgical operation that would require anesthetic doses of opioids.\n\nThe options provided are all intravenous anesthetics used for induction or maintenance of anesthesia. Considering the possibility of poor muscle relaxation and prolonged onset associated with opioid-induced anesthesia, ketamine could be the agent of choice to reduce the risk of developing postoperative hyperalgesia.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
