["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with difficulty falling asleep, frequent wakings during the night, and discomfort in her legs when lying down. She has tried an over-the-counter sleep aid that worsened her symptoms. Considering her symptoms are suggestive of restless leg syndrome (RLS), which can be caused by stress and anxiety, we should focus on medications that address RLS and related symptoms. Amitryptiline is a tricyclic antidepressant known to have sedating effects and has been used to treat RLS. Pramipexole is a dopamine agonist commonly used for RLS treatment. Escitalopram is an SSRI, which may not be directly related to the patient's symptoms. Codeine is not typically used to treat RLS.\n\nConsidering these options, we should focus on medications that address RLS and related symptoms.
