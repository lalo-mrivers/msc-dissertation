["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 13-year-old boy with progressive left leg pain for 2 months that has started to interfere with his sleep. He was hit in the thigh by a baseball one week before the pain started, which caused his leg to become red and swollen for several days. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows marked tenderness along the left mid-femur. His gait is normal. Laboratory studies show a leukocyte count of 21,000/mm3 and an ESR of 68 mm/h. An x-ray of the left lower extremity shows multiple lytic lesions in the middle third of the femur, and the surrounding cortex is covered by several layers of new bone. A biopsy of the left femur shows small round blue cells. The patient's symptoms are not consistent with medial tibial syndrome or stress fracture of the tibia, which typically occur in athletes due to overuse. The patient also does not have a compartment syndrome, as his pulses are palpable and he does not have any signs of muscular and neural ischemia. Considering the patient's age and the presence of multiple lytic lesions with surrounding new bone formation on x-ray, the most likely diagnosis is osteosarcoma.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
