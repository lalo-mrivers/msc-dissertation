["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with swelling of the legs for 2 months, which is a common problem with many possible causes. Given that he was diagnosed with hypertension and started on new medication three months ago, it's likely related to his blood pressure.

Considering the swelling is bilateral, we can rule out idiopathic cyclic edema as it typically affects one leg.
