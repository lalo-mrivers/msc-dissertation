["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is HIV positive and has been started on a combination of tenofovir, abacavir, and efavirenz. However, he developed a hypersensitivity reaction to abacavir, so it's being replaced with ritonavir. The question asks which adverse effect the patient is at greatest risk for as a result of this change in medication regimen.

Therefore, the answer must be related to ritonavir itself.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B: Lipodystrophy\"\n}"]
