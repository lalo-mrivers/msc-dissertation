["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 22-year-old woman with cardiopathic disease, who has been lost to follow-up since childhood. She presented with cyanosis, dyspnea, and cardiac murmur during her initial prenatal visit at 19 weeks of gestation. The symptoms worsened during pregnancy, but prior to that, she did not have any symptoms. The examination revealed acrocyanosis, fixed splitting of S2, and a grade 3/6 midsystolic murmur over the left upper sternal border.\n\nThe relevant documents mention the physiological changes in cardiac function during pregnancy, including an increase in blood volume, which is causing the change in this patient's condition. Specifically, the document [Changes in cardiac function during and after pregnancy expressed by systolic time intervals] states that the Pre-ejection Period (PEP) was found to shorten significantly in pregnancy due to the increased blood volume.\n\nTherefore, the answer choice D: Increase in blood volume is the correct physiological change causing the change in this patient's condition.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
