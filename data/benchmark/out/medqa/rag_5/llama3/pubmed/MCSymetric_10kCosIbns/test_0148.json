He also exhibits inattention, word finding difficulty, and laughter at inappropriate times. The patient is a poor historian. Given these symptoms, it's important to consider medical diseases that can cause psychiatric behavior. According to the study 'Finding Medical Reasons for Psychiatric Behavior', many patients with behavioral disorders in old age have underlying medical illnesses.
