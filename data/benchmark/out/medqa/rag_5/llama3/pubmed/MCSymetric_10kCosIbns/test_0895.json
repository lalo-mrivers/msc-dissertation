["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the inheritance pattern of a trinucleotide repeat disorder. The patient has abnormally long and narrow face which is a characteristic of this disorder. Since it's referred to as a trinucleotide repeat disorder, it's likely to be an inherited condition. The patient's motor milestones are not affected, but his language development is delayed. This suggests that the inheritance pattern might be autosomal dominant or X-linked dominant since it affects multiple aspects of development. The face abnormality also points towards autosomal dominant inheritance.\n\nConsidering the relevant documents, particularly 'Pitfalls in developmental diagnosis' and 'Language development in 2-year-old normal and risk infants', it seems unlikely to be an autosomal recessive disorder as it's not a severe condition that would require two copies of the mutated gene. Noninherited somatic mutation is also ruled out since the patient has multiple characteristics suggesting an inherited condition.\n\nBased on this analysis, the most likely inheritance pattern is either Autosomal dominant or X-linked dominant.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
