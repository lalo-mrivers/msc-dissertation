["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms started with a low-grade fever, malaise, and joint pain followed by the appearance of red tender bumps on his legs. The recent history of severe sore throat and fever 1 week ago is significant. Considering the patient's age and the description of the lesions as firm and tender erythematous nodules with indistinct borders, I think about inflammatory conditions that can cause such lesions. Mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome (MLNS) comes to mind, especially given the absence of cutaneous eruption, which is unusual for MLNS. However, the presence of fever, malaise, and joint pain in this case suggests a more generalised condition. Therefore, I will consider other possibilities such as erythema induratum (Bazin's disease) or systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), both of which can cause similar lesions and have constitutional symptoms like fever, malaise, and joint pain.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
