["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has breast tenderness, nausea, weight gain, and urinary frequency consistent with early pregnancy. However, she is unsure about the date of her last menstrual period, which could indicate an occult pregnancy (a pregnancy that aborts so early that no clinical suspicion of its existence arises). The urine β-hCG is negative, but this does not rule out pregnancy as it can be undetectable in some cases.
