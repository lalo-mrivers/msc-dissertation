["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The prevalence of CMV retinitis decreasing due to increased access to antiretroviral therapy means that there are fewer patients with the condition. This would lead to a decrease in true positives (patients who actually have CMV retinitis and test positive). As a result, the PPV would decrease.

The NPV would increase because even if the device tests negative, it's less likely to miss a case of CMV retinitis (since the overall prevalence is lower).\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
