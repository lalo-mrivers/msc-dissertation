["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a six-year-old boy with a history of asthma who has been using an albuterol inhaler as needed to manage his symptoms. His mother reports that he has had to increase the use of his inhaler to four times per week and has woken up three times during the night from his symptoms this month. The patient also reports being upset because he can't always keep up with his friends in the playground. Upon physical examination, there are bilateral late expiratory wheezes on auscultation. This suggests that the patient's asthma is not well-controlled and may be experiencing a moderate to severe exacerbation.\n\nThe main goal of treatment for this patient would be to improve his symptoms and prevent future episodes. Considering the patient's age and history of allergic rhinitis, it is likely that he has mild persistent asthma. Therefore, adding a daily inhaled corticosteroid such as fluticasone could help control his symptoms.\n\nHowever, before making any changes to the patient's treatment regimen, it would be important to confirm that the patient's symptoms are due to asthma and not another underlying condition. A peak flow measurement or spirometry test could help determine if the patient's lung function is compromised. If the patient's symptoms persist after adding fluticasone, further evaluation may be necessary to determine the best course of treatment.\n\nTherefore, based on this information, it would be reasonable to recommend that the patient's current therapy be maintained with the addition of fluticasone daily.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
