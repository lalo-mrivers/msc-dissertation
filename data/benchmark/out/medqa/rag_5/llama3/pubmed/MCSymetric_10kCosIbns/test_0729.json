["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 6-week-old male infant with Down syndrome presenting with recurrent nonbilious vomiting. The vomitting occurs almost immediately after most feeds and the patient becomes irritable while feeding. The patient has an epigastric mass palpated, which suggests a possible gastrointestinal issue. Given that the patient has a history of recurrent vomiting, it is unlikely to be related to a surgical abdomen or a urinary tract infection as these are typically more severe symptoms. Cyclic vomiting syndrome is also unlikely due to the presence of an epigastric mass. Therefore, the most likely cause of the patient's symptoms is hypertrophic pyloric stenosis, which is common in infants with Down syndrome.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
