["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is experiencing frequent headaches, blurry vision, and erectile dysfunction. He has a temporal visual field deficit bilaterally. An MRI shows an intrasellar mass. We are looking for the type of cells that this mass is likely derived from. Based on the symptoms and imaging findings, we can rule out pituitary hypersecretion disorders (e.g., acromegaly or hyperthyroidism) as these typically present with distinct clinical features. The presence of an intrasellar mass raises the possibility of a sellar lesion. Given the patient's age, sex, and symptom complex, empty sella syndrome is also a possibility. However, we are looking for the type of cells that the mass is derived from. Intrasellar epithelial cysts have been reported to cause empty sella syndrome. The symptoms and imaging findings are consistent with this diagnosis. Therefore, we should consider the possibility that the mass is derived from epithelial cells.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
