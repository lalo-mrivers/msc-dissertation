["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 21-month-old boy who has been noticed to have deformities in both legs since he started walking independently. His mother is concerned that he may have a growth disorder. Since the patient's height and weight are within normal ranges, I will focus on his gait and physical examination findings. The knees do not stay together when both feet and ankles are placed together, which suggests a possible issue with the knee joint alignment.

Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management would be to refer the patient to an orthopedic specialist for further evaluation and potential treatment.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
