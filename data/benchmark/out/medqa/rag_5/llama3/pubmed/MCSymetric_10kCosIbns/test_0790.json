["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The problem is to determine the dosage of amoxicillin that should be administered twice per day to maintain a steady state plasma concentration of 2 mg/L. First, we need to calculate the daily dose required to achieve this target plasma concentration. Since oral bioavailability is 75%, this means that only 25% of the total dose is absorbed and contributes to the plasma concentration. Therefore, we can set up an equation to solve for the daily dose:\n\n(2 mg/L) x (15 L/h) = (1 - 0.25) x D\n\nwhere D is the daily dose in mg.\n\nSolving this equation, we get:\n\nD = 1600 mg/day\n\nSince amoxicillin should be administered twice per day, the dose per administration would be:\n\n(1600 mg/day) / (2 administrations/day) = 800 mg/twice-daily\n\nFinally, to determine the dosage at each dosing interval, we divide this daily dose by the number of hours between doses. Assuming a 12-hour dosing interval, the answer is:\n\n(800 mg/twice-daily) / (12 hours) = approximately 67 mg/hour.\n\nSince amoxicillin should be administered twice per day, the dosage at each dosing interval would be half of this amount:\n\n(67 mg/hour) / (2 administrations/day) = 33.5 mg/twice-daily\n\nConverting this to a whole number, we get:\n\nD: 480 mg\"\n\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
