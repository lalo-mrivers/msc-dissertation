["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question describes a 2-year-old boy with a palpable left-sided abdominal mass that does not cross the midline. The CT scan shows a large, necrotic tumor on the left kidney. Histological examination of the kidney mass shows primitive blastemal cells and immature tubules and glomeruli. This suggests that the tumor is a renal tumor, specifically Wilms' tumor, which is characterized by primitive blastemal cells and immature renal structures. Therefore, the tissue is most likely derived from the same embryological structure as the Wilms' tumor.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
