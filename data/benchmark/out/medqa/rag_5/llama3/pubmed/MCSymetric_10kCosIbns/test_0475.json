["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has a history of coronary artery disease, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. He is experiencing retrosternal chest pain, which is concerning for acute coronary syndrome. However, his ECG is not shown. Based on the symptoms, I would consider pulmonary embolism, acute pericarditis, spontaneous pneumothorax, acute dissecting aneurysm of the aorta, and diseases of the gastrointestinal tract as possible causes of chest pain.
