["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The difference observed between the two strata is likely due to effect modification by CD4+ T-lymphocyte count. The authors found a significant relationship between cART adherence and DLBCL risk among patients with CD4+ cell counts below 200/mm3, but no relationship was found among patients with CD4+ cell counts above 200/mm3. This suggests that the association between cART adherence and DLBCL risk is modified by CD4+ T-lymphocyte count, with a stronger effect observed at lower CD4+ T-lymphocyte counts.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
