["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with exertional chest pain which is described as dull, burning, non-radiating substernal pain. The history of hypercholesterolemia and hypertension suggests a possible underlying coronary artery disease. An exercise stress test was performed to further evaluate the patient's pain. According to the provided documents, an exercise stress test can be useful in diagnosing coronary artery disease. Specifically, it is mentioned that correlation between coronary anatomy and the presence or absence of chest pain was studied during bicycle exercise testing in 101 patients. The predictive power of 10 common exercise test parameters compared with coronary angiography was also studied. Given these findings, it is likely that the patient's exercise stress test will show some abnormality, possibly indicating coronary artery disease.\n\nThe question asks about substances released locally to increase coronary blood flow during exertion. Adenosine is known to be released locally in the heart and plays a crucial role in increasing coronary blood flow during physical activity. Therefore, adenosine is likely the correct answer.\", \n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
