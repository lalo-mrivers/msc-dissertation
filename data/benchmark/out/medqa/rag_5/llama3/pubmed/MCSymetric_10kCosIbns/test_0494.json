["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question describes a small-for-gestational-age (SGA) newborn with a birthweight of 2050 g. The Guidelines for Perinatal Care define SGA infants as those with a birthweight < 2500 g and below the tenth percentile for gestational age. Based on this, the smaller newborn is likely to be an SGA infant. Additionally, the hematocrit value of 42% for the smaller newborn suggests that it may have had decreased blood flow in utero, which is consistent with IUGR (intrauterine growth restriction). The presence of a flattened nose and left-sided clubfoot also suggests a possible congenital abnormality. Considering these findings, the pregnancy was most likely associated with a multiple gestation.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
