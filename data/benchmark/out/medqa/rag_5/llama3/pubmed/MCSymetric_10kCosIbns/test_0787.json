["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about a 52-year-old man with Crohn disease who has dysuria and urinary urgency. He had previous UTIs and is taking infliximab. The cystoscopy shows pearl-like plaques on the bladder wall, which are likely due to a focal layer of stratified squamous epithelium with hyperkeratosis. Given that this finding is similar to the morphology described in the document 'Vitamin A inhibition of keratinization in rat urinary bladder cancer cell line Nara Bladder Tumor No. 2 in meniscus gradient culture', I infer that the patient's bladder finding might be related to a vitamin deficiency. Specifically, the feature that is most likely to be seen if this is caused by a vitamin deficiency is night blindness, which is a symptom of vitamin A deficiency.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
