["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about a loss of polyanions in glomerular basement membranes. The relevant documents describe membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis with disruption of the glomerular basement membrane, granulomatous glomerulonephritis, and glomerular injury in patients with neoplasia. However, none of these conditions are related to a loss of polyanions in the glomerular basement membranes. Therefore, we need to look for another condition that could fit this description. Glomerular/tubular mixed-type proteinuria is caused by various conditions including chronic renal failure and cadmium poisoning, both of which can result in a loss of polyanions in the glomerular basement membranes. The patient's age and presentation with pitting edema and proteinuria exceeding 3.5g in 24 hours also fit with these conditions.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
