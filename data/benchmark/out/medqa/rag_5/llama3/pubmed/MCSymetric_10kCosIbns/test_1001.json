["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with progressively worsening back pain, morning stiffness lasting around 30-60 minutes, and joint pain and stiffness in both knees. He also has wrist and proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joints that are warm and swollen. Given the patient's family history of joint issues and his mother's recent diagnosis with osteoporosis, it is likely that the patient may have a metabolic disorder or ankylosing hyperostosis causing his symptoms. The physical examination findings also suggest inflammation, which is supported by the worsening morning stiffness.\n\nOption A: Testing for serum Ca and PTH could be relevant as the patient has family history of osteoporosis and joint issues.
