["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with difficulty swallowing solid food, which is getting stuck in her chest behind the sternum. She has no issues with liquids, coughing, nasal regurgitation, hoarseness or weight loss. She also reports occasional heartburn that has lasted for about a year. The physical examination shows no abnormal findings. An endoscopic image of the esophagus reveals mucosal biopsy showing eosinophilic infiltration.\\r\\n\\r\\nConsidering the symptoms and physical findings, gastroesophageal reflux (GER) is likely to be the cause of her difficulties in swallowing. The heartburn symptom also supports this possibility. Since the patient does not have any other significant medical history or take any medications, it seems that GER is a primary concern.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe treatment options for GER include elevation of the head of the bed and antacids. However, since the patient has eosinophilic infiltration in her mucosal biopsy, an inflammatory response may be contributing to her symptoms. Therefore, a corticosteroid like budesonide may be useful in addressing this inflammation.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A: Budesonide\""]
