["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question describes an 18-month-old boy with a pruritic rash that started on his trunk and then progressed to his face and extremities.

The most likely diagnosis is therefore one of the common childhood viral infections that can cause a rash and itching.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
