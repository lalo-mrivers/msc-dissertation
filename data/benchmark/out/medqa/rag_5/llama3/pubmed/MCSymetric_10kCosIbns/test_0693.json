["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with recurrent episodes of atypical chest pain that is not related to a specific preceding event. The patient's history is unremarkable, and she takes no regular medications. She has a normal physical examination. Considering the documents provided, it seems that the patient does not have coronary artery disease, as there is no mention of any risk factors or symptoms suggestive of CAD. The pain lasts 10-15 minutes and resolves spontaneously. Given this information, it's likely that the patient's chest pain is non-cardiac in origin. Therefore, I would recommend ruling out other possible causes such as gastrointestinal disorders, musculoskeletal disorders, or psychogenic factors. Since there are no specific symptoms suggestive of coronary artery disease, aspirin or isosorbide dinitrate are unlikely to be effective in reducing her symptoms. Heparin is not relevant given the patient's normal physical examination and lack of any coagulation-related symptoms. Propranolol could potentially be used to treat anxiety related to the pain, but it may not directly address the underlying cause of the pain.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
