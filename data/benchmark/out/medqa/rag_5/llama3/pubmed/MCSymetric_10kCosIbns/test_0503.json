["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks for the normal values of right ventricular pressures. The pulmonary wedge pressure is given as 10 mmHg, which suggests that we are looking at a patient without clinical heart disease. According to the Comparison of right atrial and pulmonary capillary wedge pressures document, in patients without clinical heart disease, the right atrial pressure (Pra) approximates the pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (Pcw). Therefore, we can assume that Pra is also around 10 mmHg.\n\nThe Effect of positive end-expiratory pressure on right ventricular function in humans document does not provide a direct answer to this question. However, it suggests that PEEP increases both Pra and pericardial pressure (Ppc), but RV ejection fraction (ef) remains unaffected.\n\nThe [The evaluation of incremental positive end-expiratory pressure on right ventricular hemodynamics as determined by the thermodilution technique] document also does not provide a direct answer, but it suggests that PEEP does not influence right ventricular hemodynamics.\n\nThe Hemodynamics of the right ventricle in normal and disease states document provides some general information about the physiology of the right ventricle, but it does not specifically address the question at hand.\n\n[Myocardial contractile capacity of the right ventricle in lesser circulation hypertension and in right ventricular insufficiency] document is not relevant to this question.\n\nConsidering all the available documents, we can conclude that the normal values for right ventricular pressures are unknown. However, based on the comparison between Pra and Pcw in patients without clinical heart disease, we can make an educated guess.\", \"answer_choice\": C: 10/0 mmHg}"]
