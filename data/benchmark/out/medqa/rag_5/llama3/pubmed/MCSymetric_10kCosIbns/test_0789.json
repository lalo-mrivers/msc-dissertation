["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has a history of hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and is currently being treated as an outpatient for pneumonia. He also has polymorphic ventricular tachycardia with cyclic alteration of the QRS axis on telemetry. This combination suggests that the syncope may be related to cardiac arrhythmias rather than neurologic causes. The case reports provided suggest that prolonged QT interval can cause syncope, and this is a possibility given the patient's polymorphic ventricular tachycardia. Additionally, there is no evidence of neurocardiogenic dysfunction or postural hypotension, which are common cardiovascular causes of syncope. Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination, the most likely underlying cause of his syncope is prolonged QT interval.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
