["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's vital signs are within normal limits initially, but then she develops dizziness and hypotension (90/60 mm Hg) after receiving epidural anesthesia. This suggests that the cause of her hypotension is not related to a sudden change in her overall physical state or to hypovolemia. The fact that her fetal heart rate remains reactive with no decelerations suggests that the placental perfusion rate is normal, which also makes hypovolemia less likely as an underlying cause. Given these factors, it's more likely that the patient's hypotension is related to a sympathetic block caused by the epidural anesthesia.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
