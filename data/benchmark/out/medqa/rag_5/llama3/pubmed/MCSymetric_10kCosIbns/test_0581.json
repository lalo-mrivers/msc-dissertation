["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with shortness of breath, palpitations, and symptoms suggestive of congestive heart failure. The electrocardiogram shows a rhythm disturbance. The prevalence of disturbance of cardiac rhythm in healthy New Zealand Adults: a pilot study suggests that ventricular ectopy is more common in younger individuals, but the age range of 20-70 years in this study indicates that age alone does not have a strong correlation with the patient's heart rhythm. The same study also shows that dysrhythmia occurred in 37 percent of healthy adults, making it a common finding. Given the patient's symptoms and findings, cardiac arrhythmias are likely to be present. A primary care approach to cardiac arrhythmias emphasizes the importance of a thorough history and physical examination, as well as an electrocardiogram for accurate identification. Since the patient is smoking 10 cigarettes per day for the past 15 years, it is unlikely that smoking would have a strong positive correlation with her heart rhythm.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
