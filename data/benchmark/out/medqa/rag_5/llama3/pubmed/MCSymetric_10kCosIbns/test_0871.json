["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with a 2-year history of pelvic pain, irritative voiding symptoms, and painful ejaculation. The physical examination is unremarkable except for a mildly tender prostate. The urine test shows white cells in the expressed prostatic secretion but not in the mid-stream urine sample. This suggests that the infection is likely located in the prostate gland rather than the urinary tract.\n\nThe patient has been prescribed antimicrobial therapy multiple times with no improvement, which further supports the idea of chronic non-bacterial prostatitis.\n\nAdditionally, the patient's symptoms are also consistent with chronic pelvic pain syndrome, which can cause a range of symptoms including pelvic pain, irritative voiding symptoms, and painful ejaculation.\n\nFurthermore, the patient's history of recurrent abdominal pain, periods of constipation and diarrhea, and fatigability suggests that there may be a psychosomatic or functional component to his symptoms, which is also consistent with chronic non-bacterial prostatitis.\n\nBased on these findings, I believe the most likely diagnosis is B: Chronic, non-bacterial prostatitis.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
