["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant document for this question is 'Changes in coronary and collateral flows and adequacy of perfusion in the dog following one and three months of circumflex occlusion.' In this study, the resistances as related to total heart weight of the circumflex artery were found to be 0.59 +/- 0.06 mm Hg/[(ml/min)/100 g]. Since there is an occlusion that has caused a 50% reduction in the diameter of the left circumflex artery, the resistance will increase. The increase in resistance can be calculated by comparing it with the control value.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
