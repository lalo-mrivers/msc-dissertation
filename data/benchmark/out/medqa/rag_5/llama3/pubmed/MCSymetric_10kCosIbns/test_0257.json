["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has hyperphenylalaninemia with a serum phenylalanine concentration of 44 mg/dL. He was started on a special diet which resolved the hyperphenylalaninemia. However, he still has persistent head lag and other symptoms. This suggests that the hyperphenylalaninemia may not be due to classic PKU. The patient's blue eyes, pale skin, blonde hair, and generalized hypotonia are also suspicious of a different condition. The elevated serum prolactin level is another important clue. Tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) deficiency should be considered as it can cause hyperphenylalaninemia. BH4 loading test and determination of renal excretion of pterins, as well as dihydropteridine reductase activity in erythrocytes would be necessary to confirm this diagnosis.\", \"answer_choice\": D}"]
