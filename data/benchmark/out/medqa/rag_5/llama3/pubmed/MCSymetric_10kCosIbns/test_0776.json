["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking to calculate the number needed to treat for the new drug. To do this, we need to find the difference in cure rates between the two groups. The study treatment group had 190 out of 250 participants cured, while the control group had 165 out of 250 participants cured. The absolute risk reduction is the difference in cure rates: (190/250) - (165/250) = 25/250. Therefore, we need to treat 25 participants with the new drug to prevent one case of tinea versicolor.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
