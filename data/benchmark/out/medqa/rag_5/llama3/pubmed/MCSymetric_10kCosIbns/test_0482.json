["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the effects of hydroxyurea on sickle cell anemia. Hydroxyurea is a cytostatic agent that increases fetal hemoglobin (HgbF) production, which interferes with sickle hemoglobin polymerization and decreases the tendency toward intracellular polymerization of sickle hemoglobin. This leads to increased oxygen carrying capacity of hemoglobin. Additionally, hydroxyurea raises mean corpuscular volume (MCV), which is a parameter measured in red cell indices. The documents also mention that HgbF contains gammaglobin chains instead of beta chains, making it not affected by the genetic defect causing sickle cell disease.\", \"answer_choice\": B}"]
