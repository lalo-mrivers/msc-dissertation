["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 3-week-old newborn with poor feeding, irritability, frequent vomiting, and greenish stools. He was born at term and had his first bowel movement at 50 hours of life. He has since had one bowel movement daily. The physical examination reveals small ears, a broad nasal bridge, and a large space between the toes. The rectal exam shows an explosive release of stool following the finger removal. An x-ray of the abdomen shows dilated colon followed by a segment without stool or air. Considering these symptoms and findings, the most likely diagnosis is Hirschsprung's disease. The presence of megacolon on the x-ray is consistent with this diagnosis. Non-nutritive sucking and growth development in low-birthweight infants are not directly related to this patient's condition.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
