["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the cause of a whistling noise when the patient respires through her nose 3 months after rhinoplasty. We need to consider the possible causes based on the provided documents. The documents suggest that nasal obstruction can occur due to various reasons such as pre-existent or undetected septal deviation, turbinate hypertrophy, intranasal adhesions, scar tissue web formation in the nasal vault, inadequate nasal tip support, and alar collapse.\n\nThe patient has been recovering well, but the whistling noise is a new symptom. This suggests that it may be related to something that developed after the surgery rather than a pre-existing condition. Post-operative swelling (Option A) could be a possibility, but the documents suggest that this would not typically cause a whistling noise.\n\nA septal hematoma causing a perforation (Option B) is unlikely as there is no mention of bleeding or trauma to the nasal septum in the patient's history.\n\nA deviated septum that is now straight, resulting in altered nasal airflow (Option C) could be a possibility. However, the documents suggest that this would not typically cause a whistling noise.\n\nExcessive columellar show resulting in increased nasal airflow (Option D) is unlikely as there is no mention of excessive skin or tissue at the base of the nose in the patient's history.\n\nBased on these considerations, the most likely cause of the whistling noise is altered nasal airflow due to a deviated septum that was previously straightened during rhinoplasty.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"]
