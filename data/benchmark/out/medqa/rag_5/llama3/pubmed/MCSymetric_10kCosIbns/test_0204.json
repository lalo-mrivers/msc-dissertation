["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the documents provided, we can infer that renal fusion must occur before the kidneys ascend between the umbilical arteries. This information is taken from 'Renal ectopia and fusion.  Embryologic Basis.' According to this document, the Carnegie collection of human embryos was studied to determine when horseshoe kidneys and crossed fused ectopic kidneys might develop. It was found that renal fusion must occur before the kidneys ascend between the umbilical arteries. Since the patient has Turner's syndrome and is diagnosed with fused poles of her kidneys inferiorly, we can conclude that this occurred before the normal ascension of the kidney during embryological development.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
