["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with a pink bump on his forehead that rapidly developed over the last month. He has had significant sun exposure in the past, including multiple blistering sunburns. The physical examination reveals a 2 cm dome-shaped plaque with a central keratin plug. Excisional biopsy shows an exophytic nodule with central invagination, full of keratin. Keratinocyte atypia is minimal.\\n\\nConsidering the patient's history and physical examination findings, I think about common skin lesions that can occur on the forehead due to sun exposure. The presence of a dome-shaped plaque with a central keratin plug suggests a lesion with a central invagination, which is consistent with cutaneous horns or keratoacanthomas.\\n\\nGiven the minimal atypia in the keratinocytes and the exophytic nodule with central invagination, I think that the most likely diagnosis is Keratoacanthoma.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
