["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the developmental stage during which a T cell undergoes positive selection. According to the documents, positive selection is dependent upon recognition of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules on thymic stroma. This process ensures the preservation of self-MHC-restricted T cells. The passage describes the development of different lineages of T cells within the thymus, including the CD4+8+ stage and the single-positive stages. We know that double-positive T cells are those that have not yet undergone positive selection. Therefore, we can conclude that positive selection occurs during the development stage when the T cell is still double-positive.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
