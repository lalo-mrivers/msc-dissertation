["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about a 17-year-old girl with severe acne vulgaris who has not responded to treatment.

The treatment started with combined oral contraceptive pills aims to reduce the risk of developing certain conditions. Hormonal therapy is known to play a role in acne pathogenesis, and androgens have been implicated as a cause of postmenopausal acne.
