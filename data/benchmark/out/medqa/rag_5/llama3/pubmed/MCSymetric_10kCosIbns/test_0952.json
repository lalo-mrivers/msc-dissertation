["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for the most appropriate recommendation for temporary control of severe diarrhea and bloating in a patient diagnosed with celiac disease. The documents provided mention anatomical disturbances, enzymatic deficiencies, exudation of proteins, exfoliation of epithelial cells, and anorexia as pathophysiologic mechanisms leading to deficient absorption and malnutrition.
