["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents mention that ovarian cancer tends to remain intraabdominal even in advanced cases. Primary ovarian lymphatic drainage occurs via the infundibulopelvic ligament to the para-aortic nodes. The presence of an ovarian tumor extending into adjacent pelvic viscera may allow direct lymphatic continuity with inguinal, external, and common iliac lymph nodes. In the absence of such extension it is traditionally believed that the drainage via the infundibulopelvics is so important that only with its blockage, presumably by tumor emboli, can retrograde drainage to pelvic and inguinal nodes occur. Since this patient has stage 4 ovarian cancer with confirmed distant metastases in the lungs and brain, it is likely that the lymphatic route for metastasis to the brain involves a retrograde drainage.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
