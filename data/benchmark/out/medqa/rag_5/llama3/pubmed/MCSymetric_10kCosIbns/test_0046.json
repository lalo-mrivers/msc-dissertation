["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The primary endpoint is the number of deaths from cardiac causes. The difference between the two groups is 76 (210 - 134). To find the NNT, we need to divide this difference by the hazard ratio or the relative risk. Since the p-value is 0.03, it suggests that there is a statistically significant difference between the two groups. However, we don't have the exact hazard ratio or relative risk from the study, so we can use the number of patients in each group to estimate this value. The event rate for medication 1 is 134/1500 = 0.0894 (or approximately 8.94%), and the event rate for medication 2 is 210/1500 = 0.14 (or approximately 14%). The relative risk can be calculated as the ratio of these two rates, which is approximately 1.57. We then divide the difference in events by this relative risk to get the NNT: 76 / 1.57 â‰ˆ 48.5. Rounding up to the nearest whole number gives us an NNT of 50.\", \"answer_choice\": D}"]
