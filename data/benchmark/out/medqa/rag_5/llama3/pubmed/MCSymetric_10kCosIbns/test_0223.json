["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms are episodic pelvic pain radiating to her back and thighs a few hours before her menstrual period and lasting for 2 days. The pain is relieved with ibuprofen. Menses have occurred at regular 28-day intervals since menarche. The patient is sexually active with two male partners and uses condoms inconsistently. Vital signs are within normal limits, and physical examination shows no abnormalities.\n\nThe most likely cause of this patient's symptoms is the pelvic joint syndrome, as mentioned in [Pelvic joint syndrome as the cause of chronic pelvic pain in women]. This diagnosis is also supported by the fact that the patient experiences severe pelvic girdle relaxation during her menstrual period.\n\nAnother possible cause could be endometrial sloughing and uterine contractions mediated by prostaglandin, but this seems less likely given the patient's history of regular menses and the absence of any abnormal findings on physical examination.\n\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
