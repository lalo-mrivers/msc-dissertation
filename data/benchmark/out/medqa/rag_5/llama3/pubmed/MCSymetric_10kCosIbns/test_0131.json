["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has recently undergone a total thyroidectomy for papillary thyroid cancer. The symptoms he is experiencing, such as nausea, abdominal discomfort, diarrhea, and progressive perioral numbness, are consistent with hypocalcemia (low calcium levels). This is common after total thyroidectomy, especially when the parathyroid glands are injured or removed. The patient's medication history only includes a multivitamin supplement, which would not cause these symptoms.\n\nThe ECG finding that is most likely in this patient is QT prolongation. Hypocalcemia can cause changes in cardiac conduction and rhythm, including QT prolongation, torsade de pointes, and ventricular tachycardia. The other options, such as peaked T waves and PR prolongation, are not directly related to hypocalcemia.\n\nThe patient's physical examination shows a well-healing surgical wound on the neck, which is consistent with a recent thyroidectomy. The nurse's observation of a spasm in the patient's hand suggests that his symptoms may be related to hypocalcemia. Fatigue is also a common symptom of hypocalcemia.\n\nBased on this information, the most likely ECG finding in this patient is QT prolongation.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
