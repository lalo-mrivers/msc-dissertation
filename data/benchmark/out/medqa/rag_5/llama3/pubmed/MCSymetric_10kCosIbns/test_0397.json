["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has a family history of mild anemia in his father and aunt. The patient himself has autoimmune hemolytic anemia with IgG autoantibodies against RBCs. This suggests that the underlying disorder is likely immune-mediated. Since there is no specific information about the inheritance pattern, we need to look for clues in the provided documents. One possibility is a genetic predisposition to an immune-related disorder. The documents do not specifically mention autoimmune hemolytic anemia as being inherited in an autosomal dominant or X-linked manner.

This suggests that there may be a genetic component to the disorder. Therefore, we should consider the possibility of multifactorial inheritance.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
