["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has symptoms of rubella infection, including a rash, watery nasal discharge, and mild bilateral knee pain. The serology test shows that she has IgG antibodies to rubella virus, with a titer of 1:64 and high avidity, indicating previous exposure to the virus. However, her current IgM antibody level is negative, suggesting that this is not a primary infection but rather reinfection or a reactivation of past infection. The patient's concern is for the baby, and it is important to determine whether the fetus has been infected.\n\nThe literature suggests that reinfection with rubella during pregnancy is rare, but it can occur in women whose hemagglutinin titers are lower than 1/64. In this case, the patient's IgG titer is 1:64, which may indicate a higher risk of fetal infection. However, the literature also suggests that reinfection during pregnancy is not usually associated with viremia or significant risk to the fetus.\n\nGiven the patient's symptoms and serology results, it would be prudent to perform additional testing to determine whether the fetus has been infected. Chorionic villus sampling (CVS) could provide a definitive diagnosis of congenital rubella syndrome (CRS) in the fetus. If the test is negative, it would suggest that the fetus is not infected and reassure the patient about the baby's health.\n\nTherefore, the proper next step in the management of this woman would be to arrange for CVS to determine whether the fetus has been infected with rubella virus.\", \"answer_choice\": C}"]
