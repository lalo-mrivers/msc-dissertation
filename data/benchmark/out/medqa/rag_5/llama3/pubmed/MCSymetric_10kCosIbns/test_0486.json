["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question describes a 2-year-old boy in respiratory distress with no toys or objects in his bed. The patient's physical exam shows a child in respiratory distress.

One possibility is infection-induced pathologic change in respiratory parameters, as described in [Infection-induced pathologic change in respiratory parameters in the young infant].
