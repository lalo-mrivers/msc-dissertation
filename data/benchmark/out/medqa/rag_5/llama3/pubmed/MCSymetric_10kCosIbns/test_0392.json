["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 60-year-old man with a history of smoking and occasional cough. He does not experience shortness of breath at rest but has progressively worsening shortness of breath for the past 2 months. The patient's lung auscultation reveals a prolonged expiratory phase and end-expiratory wheezing. Spirometry shows an FEV1:FVC ratio of 62%, an FEV1 of 60% of predicted, and a total lung capacity of 125% of predicted. Additionally, the diffusion capacity of the lung (DLCO) is decreased. Considering these symptoms and laboratory findings, the most likely diagnosis is Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD).\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
