["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the blood smear of a patient with beta-thalassemia intermedia due to a mutation in the Kozak sequence. Based on the information provided, we know that the patient has a C----G mutation at position 6 3' to the terminating codon, which causes a silent beta-thalassemia. This mutation leads to diminished beta chain synthesis, but does not completely abolish it. Therefore, the blood smear would be expected to show microcytic red blood cells, as there is decreased production of hemoglobin due to the impaired translation of the beta-globin mRNA.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
