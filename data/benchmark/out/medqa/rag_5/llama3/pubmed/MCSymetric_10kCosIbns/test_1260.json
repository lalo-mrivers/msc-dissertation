["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has a history of Parkinson's disease and was initiated on treatment four months ago. The patient is now experiencing response fluctuations on levodopa, which is a common issue with this medication. Given the patient's diagnosis and symptoms, it is likely that they were prescribed selegiline (Eldepryl) to treat their Parkinson's disease. Selegiline is known for its ability to selectively inhibit monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B), an enzyme that breaks down dopamine in the brain. This inhibition allows more dopamine to be available and can help alleviate symptoms of Parkinson's disease such as rigidity, bradykinesia, and tremors.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C: Selective inhibition of monoamine oxidase B\""]
