["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient had a severe construction accident and was found unconscious with a large metal spike protruding from his abdomen. He underwent surgery to remove the foreign body and control bleeding, but experienced an acute drop in blood pressure during surgery with ST elevations noted in multiple leads. The patient remained sedated after surgery until day 3 when he experienced oxygen desaturation despite being on a respirator with 100% oxygen at 15 breaths/minute. Auscultation revealed air entry bilaterally with crackles, and Swan-Ganz catheter readings showed elevated pressures in the right ventricle, pulmonary artery, and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure. The patient died soon after this episode. Based on these findings, the most likely direct cause of death is cardiac-related.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
