["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the healing of cartilaginous injuries. The document 'Pathophysiology of soft tissue repair' states that injury to the musculotendinous unit resulting from either blunt trauma, tears or laceration, heal primarily by formation of granulation tissue and scarring. Cartilage, which lacks an inflammatory response, frequently results in poor tissue repair with subsequent degeneration of the injured cartilage. The document 'Acute traumatic cartilage damage--therapy and results' states that articular cartilage lesions have a slow tendency toward recovery and difficulties in diagnosing cartilage lesions cause severe problems in treating this type of knee disorder.\n\nThe document 'Sports traumatology today' reviews common current sports injury problems, including anterior cruciate ligament injuries, posterior cruciate ligament injuries, ankle ligament injuries, and articular cartilage lesions. The document highlights the importance of early diagnosis with appropriate therapy to minimize any potential loss of function. It also discusses the treatment options for various types of knee joint disorders.\n\nThe present question is about promoting healing in a group with cartilaginous injury. The document 'Cartilage transplantation in the knee joint experiment - clinic - technique' states that autologous and fresh homologous grafts survive, while stored grafts are absorbed. This suggests that the use of autologous or fresh homologous tissue could promote healing in a group with cartilaginous injury.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, it can be concluded that transplanting mature chondrocytes would most likely promote healing in the group with cartilaginous injury.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: Mature chondrocytes\""]
