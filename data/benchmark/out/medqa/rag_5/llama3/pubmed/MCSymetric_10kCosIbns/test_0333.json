["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 36-year-old man with acute myeloid leukemia who was involved in a high-speed motor-vehicle collision. He has multiple bruises and lacerations, decreased breath sounds over the right lung base, and tenderness to palpation over the left chest wall. His vital signs are stable, but he is unresponsive and only responds to painful stimuli. The patient's abdominal examination shows diffuse tenderness without guarding or rebound.\n\nThe first step in management would be to address the patient's airway, breathing, and circulation (ABCs). Since the patient is unresponsive, intubation and mechanical ventilation (D) would be the most appropriate next step in management to ensure his oxygenation and ventilation. The other options do not directly address the patient's life-threatening injuries or ABCs.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
