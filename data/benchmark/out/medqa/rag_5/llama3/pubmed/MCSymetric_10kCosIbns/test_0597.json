["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about a picornavirus that preferentially infects hepatocytes. From the relevant documents, it is mentioned that many enteroviruses are responsible for acute viral diseases, including non-A, non-B hepatitis. Picornaviruses are a type of enterovirus. Therefore, the virus being studied is likely an enterovirus.\n\nIn the document 'Survival and disinfectant inactivation of the human immunodeficiency virus: a critical review', it is mentioned that some viruses (including a herpesvirus and a togavirus) proved to have relatively low resistance to various chemico-physical influences. This suggests that different viruses may have varying levels of resistance to different disinfectants.\n\nIn terms of the provided options, chlorhexidine has been shown to be effective against many types of viruses, including enteroviruses (although it is not specifically mentioned in this document). Sodium hypochlorite and sulfuric acid are both strong oxidizing agents that have been shown to inactivate various viruses, but they may not be as specific as chlorhexidine for inactivating enteroviruses. Ethyl alcohol has antimicrobial properties, but its effectiveness against viruses is generally lower than that of other disinfectants.\n\nBased on this information, the most likely effective disinfectant would be chlorhexidine.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
