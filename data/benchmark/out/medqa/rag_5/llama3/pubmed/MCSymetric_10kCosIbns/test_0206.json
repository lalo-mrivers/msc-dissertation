["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking which option would most likely suggest that the two loci (ΔF508 mutation and the novel mutation) have a high probability of being closely linked. To answer this, we need to think about what kind of information would indicate linkage between the two loci. Since ΔF508 is already known to be linked to other genetic markers on chromosome 7q31, it's likely that the novel mutation would also be located in close proximity to these markers if they are closely linked. This means that we should look for evidence that suggests a strong association between the novel mutation and these markers.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
