["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant document is [The effects of atrial natriuretic peptide on left ventricular function in subjects with heart failure]. The infusion of ANP decreased mean blood pressure and wedge pressure, increased cardiac output and left ventricular ejection fraction. This suggests that ANP has a vasodilatory effect. Additionally, the document [Cardiac peptides and their importance in heart failure] states that ANP reduces afterload by its vasodilatatory actions. Therefore, the patient would expect to experience C: Increased glomerular filtration rate, restricted aldosterone release, vascular smooth muscle dilation.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
