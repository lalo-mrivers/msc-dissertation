["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has a transmural myocardial infarction in the posterior 1/3 of the ventricular septum. The case studies provided suggest that myocardial infarctions with patent coronary arteries are possible, and the most likely mechanism is temporary occlusion of an epicardial coronary artery by spasm or platelet aggregates. Since the patient has a transmural infarction, it's unlikely that the infarction occurred due to embolization from another source. Therefore, we should focus on the coronary arteries that supply the septum.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
