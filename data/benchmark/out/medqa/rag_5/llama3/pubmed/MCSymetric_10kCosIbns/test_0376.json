["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 3-month-old girl with symptoms such as productive cough, watery stools, and not gaining weight. She was born at 38 weeks' gestation and has not received any immunizations. The physical examination shows white plaques on the tongue and palate, rales bilaterally, and cervical and inguinal lymphadenopathy. These findings suggest an infectious process. The patient's symptoms and physical examination are consistent with respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), which is a common complication in premature infants. The fact that the patient was born at 38 weeks' gestation suggests that she may be a low-birth-weight infant, which increases the risk of RDS. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is RDS.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
