["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has a history of smoking and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is likely. The arterial blood gases analysis shows pH 7.49, PaO2 58 mm Hg, and PaCO2 30 mm Hg which suggests respiratory failure. Dyspnea and acrocyanosis are also present on physical examination. Considering the patient's history of smoking and COPD, acute respiratory failure is likely due to decreased V/Q (ventilation-perfusion) ratio caused by bronchial obstruction. Opioid receptors activation may also contribute to depression of the respiratory center, but it is not the primary cause of respiratory failure.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
