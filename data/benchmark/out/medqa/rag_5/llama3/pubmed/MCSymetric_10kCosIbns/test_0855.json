["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is an 18-month-old boy who was born at 37 weeks' gestation and spent one night in the neonatal intensive care unit for respiratory distress. He started walking independently at 12 months, but has stopped walking and appears weaker than he was a few months ago. He also has started having brief convulsive episodes over the past week. On exam, the child demonstrates muscle rigidity and diffuse muscle wasting. He is unable to stand or sit up straight. His patellar, Achilles, and brachioradialis reflexes are absent. Fundoscopic examination is unremarkable. A urine sample demonstrates metachromic granules.\n\nThe patient's symptoms include late walking, weakness, convulsive episodes, and absence of deep tendon reflexes. The presence of metachromic granules in the urine suggests a lysosomal storage disorder. The absence of deep tendon reflexes and muscle rigidity suggests a neurological disorder.\n\nConsidering these findings, the most likely diagnosis is Krabbe disease, which is caused by a deficiency of beta-galactocerebrosidase enzyme.\", \n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
