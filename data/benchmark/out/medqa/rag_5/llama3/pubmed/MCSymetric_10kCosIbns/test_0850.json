["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient was struck by a high-voltage power line on his right arm, resulting in a burn. He is alert but in severe pain localizing bilaterally in the flanks as well as in his right arm where contact with the power line occurred. This suggests that the electrical current may have caused internal injuries. The patient's vitals are within normal limits except for mild tachypnea at 21/min, which could be a sign of respiratory distress. Considering the possibility of internal injuries and respiratory distress, I would prioritize diagnostic tests that can quickly assess the patient's internal organs and cardiovascular system.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
