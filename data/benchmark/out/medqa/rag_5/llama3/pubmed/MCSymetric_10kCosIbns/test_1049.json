["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question describes the development of symptoms of infection in animals exposed to bacteria that were cultivated with lysed bacteria from an infectious isolate. This suggests that the noninfectious isolate acquired some property or characteristic from the infectious isolate, which enabled it to cause infection. Given that the infectious isolate is a type B strain and Haemophilus influenzae is known to have a natural competence pathway for DNA transformation, it is likely that the noninfectious isolate transformed into an infectious state through the acquisition of DNA from the infectious isolate. This process is facilitated by the presence of lysed bacteria in the culture, which provides a source of free DNA.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C: Transformation\"\n}"]
