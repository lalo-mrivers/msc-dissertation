["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the maintenance dose, we need to calculate the total amount of drug needed for the patient. First, we need to find the area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) which represents the total amount of drug in the body over a specific time period.\n\nWe can do this by using the formula AUC = Cmax * Vd / k where Cmax is the desired plasma concentration (15 mg/L), Vd is the volume of distribution (14.3 liters), and k is the elimination rate constant which is related to the half-life (2 hours).\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the clearance (CL) which is the ratio of dose to AUC.\n\nCL = Dose / AUC\n\nWe are given that the bioavailability is 50%, so the actual dose needed would be half of the calculated dose. The investigator wants the plasma concentration to be maintained at 15 mg/L, so we can set up an equation using the formula: Cmax = Dose / (Vd * k)\n\nSolving for Dose, we get:\n\nDose = Cmax * Vd * k\n\nWe are given that Cmax is 15 mg/L. To convert this to milligrams, we need to multiply by the volume of distribution (14.3 liters) and the bioavailability (0.5).\n\nCmax * Vd * k = 15 * 14.3 * 2 = 426\n\nNow we can calculate the clearance:\n\nCL = Dose / AUC\n= 213 mg / (AUC)\n\nNext, we need to calculate the maintenance dose which is the dose needed every 8 hours.\n\nWe can do this by multiplying the total dose by the fraction of time in a day where the drug needs to be present at the desired concentration. In this case, that would be:\n\nMaintenance Dose = Total Dose * (1 - e^(-k*8))\n\nwhere k is the elimination rate constant and 8 is the dosing interval.\n\nSubstituting the values we get:\n\nMaintenance Dose = 213 mg * (1 - e^(-0.35))\n= 430 mg\n\nSo, the correct answer is B: 430 milligrams.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
