["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of difficulty swallowing with solid food getting stuck in his chest behind the sternum are consistent with globus sensation, which is a common symptom associated with gastroesophageal reflux (GER). The fact that drinking does not cause any difficulty swallowing suggests that the issue may be related to the patient's ability to swallow solids rather than liquids. The patient's past medical history of heartburn and lack of response to high-dose omeprazole also supports a diagnosis of GER.
