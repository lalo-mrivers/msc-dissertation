["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a male newborn born at 27 weeks' gestation and evaluated for rapid breathing and hypoxia shortly after birth. The mother had no prenatal care. The patient has normal heart sounds, intercostal retractions, and nasal flaring on cardiopulmonary examination. An x-ray of the chest shows low lung volumes, air bronchograms, and diffuse ground-glass opacities. The patient is started on nasal continuous positive airway pressure. Based on these findings, it is likely that the patient has respiratory distress syndrome (RDS). RDS is a common condition in premature infants born at 27 weeks' gestation or earlier. The x-ray findings of low lung volumes, air bronchograms, and diffuse ground-glass opacities are consistent with RDS.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
