["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with severe itching around his anus, which is a characteristic of pruritus ani. The scotch tape test is positive, suggesting that the itching may be caused by an allergic contact dermatitis. The patient has a previous documented allergy to albendazole, which suggests that they may have a history of allergic reactions. Considering these factors, Ivermectin is not likely to be the cause of the itching. Amphotericin B and Praziquantel are antiparasitic medications that would not typically be used to treat pruritus ani.
