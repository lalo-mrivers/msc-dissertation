["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with abdominal pain on the right side of her abdomen, which started yesterday and has been worsening. She has experienced episodes of vomiting and diarrhea. The patient has a past medical history of constipation treated with fiber supplements. Her physical exam reveals reproducible right lower quadrant pain when the left lower quadrant is palpated. Given that the patient's symptoms are consistent with acute abdominal pain, I would look for high-risk factors to identify if she requires immediate surgical intervention. According to the guidelines, high-risk factors include pain for less than 48 hours, pain followed by vomiting, guarding and rebound tenderness on physical examination, advanced age, and a prior surgical procedure. In this case, the patient's pain has been worsening over time, which is a high-risk factor. Therefore, I would consider immediate hospitalization and observation to rule out any life-threatening conditions.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
