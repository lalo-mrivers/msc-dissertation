["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is 16 years old and has never had a period. She has normal breast development and pubic hair growth, but no signs of precocious puberty. Her laboratory results show normal electrolyte levels, blood sugar, and liver enzymes. FSH level is in the normal range for a female her age. Estrogen level is also within the normal range for a female her age. The ultrasound shows a normal uterus and ovaries.\\nThe patient's symptoms of headaches with photosensitivity and nausea are indicative of hormonal fluctuations, possibly related to polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). However, given that she has never had a period, it is more likely that her menstrual irregularity is due to primary amenorrhea rather than PCOS.\\nAmenorrhea can be caused by problems affecting the hypothalamus, pituitary, or ovaries. Given that her FSH level is normal and estrogen level is within the normal range, it is unlikely that she has a problem with her ovaries or hypothalamus.\\nThe patient's mother and sister had menarche at age 15, which suggests that her pubertal development may be delayed rather than accelerated.\\nTherefore, the most likely diagnosis is primary amenorrhea due to late puberty.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
