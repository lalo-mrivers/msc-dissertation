["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 1-month-old girl with lethargy and irritability between meals. The physical exam shows slight jaundice, normal heart rate and rhythm, and clear lungs. Laboratory tests reveal normocytic anemia with elevated reticulocyte count and decreased haptoglobin. The Coombs test is negative, and red blood cell osmotic fragility gap is normal. Given these findings, the physician determined that the patient has an enzyme deficiency.\n\nThe patient's symptoms are related to a metabolic disorder, specifically an inborn error of metabolism. This type of condition often requires dietary control as a form of therapy. The laboratory evaluation increases in complexity as one proceeds to definitive diagnosis and modern organic analysis. Therefore, we need to focus on metabolic disorders that can cause normocytic anemia with elevated reticulocyte count.\n\nOne possible condition is hereditary spherocytosis. This disorder is caused by a deficiency of the enzyme spectrin. Spectrin is allosterically inhibited by fructose 1,6-bisphosphate.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C: Fructose 1,6-bisphosphate\""]
