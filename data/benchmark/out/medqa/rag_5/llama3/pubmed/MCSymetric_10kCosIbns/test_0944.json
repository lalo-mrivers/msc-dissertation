["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has a history of diet-controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus, but the laboratory studies show hyperglycemia (134 mg/dL). This suggests that the patient's symptoms are not primarily related to his diabetes. The patient is developing signs of drug-induced febrile mucocutaneous syndrome, which can be caused by various medications including sulfonamide preparations, penicillins, and butazones. The laboratory studies show elevated levels of uric acid (11.2 mg/dL) and creatinine (2.2 mg/dL), suggesting that the patient may have developed a condition like tumor lysis syndrome or hyperuricemia. Allopurinol is an anti-gout medication that can help reduce uric acid production and prevent complications. Therefore, it would be most effective in preventing this patient's current symptoms.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
