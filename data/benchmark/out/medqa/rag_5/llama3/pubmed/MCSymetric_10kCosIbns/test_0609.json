The patient also had to undergo segmental small bowel resection several times due to intestinal obstruction and fistula formation. This suggests that the patient may have malabsorption issues, leading to nutritional deficiencies. The patient's symptoms are consistent with telogen effluvium, which is often caused by hormonal or systemic disorders. Given the patient's history of Crohn's disease and segmental small bowel resection, it is likely that the patient has a deficiency in one of the B vitamins, specifically cobalamin (vitamin B12).
