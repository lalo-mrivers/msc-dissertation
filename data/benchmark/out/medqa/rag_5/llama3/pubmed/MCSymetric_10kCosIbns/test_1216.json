["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is an unrestrained driver who was involved in a motor vehicle collision. He is unconscious on arrival with multiple injuries including ecchymoses over the chest, lacerations over the abdomen and scalp, and bilateral crackles at the lung bases. The jugular venous pressure is increased indicating possible cardiac compromise. The absence of p-waves on the electrocardiogram suggests an injury to the atria or atrioventricular valves.
