["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with severe fear reactions to seeing dogs after moving into a new suburban neighborhood. She has always had an irrational and excessive fear of dogs but was able to avoid it for most of her life while living in the city. The recent change in environment and frequent exposure to dogs through neighbors walking their pets has triggered the phobic response.\n\nThe patient's symptoms, including feeling short of breath and avoidance behaviors (stopping picking up children from bus stop and not playing outside), suggest a specific phobia, likely canine-specific.\n\nConsidering the psychological impact of this phobia on daily life, cognitive-behavioral therapy would be an effective approach to address the patient's thoughts, feelings, and behaviors associated with dog sightings. This treatment modality helps patients identify and challenge negative thought patterns, reframe their perspective, and develop coping strategies.\n\nWhile selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) could potentially help alleviate anxiety symptoms, they may not specifically target the phobic response to dogs.\n\nShort-acting benzodiazepines might provide temporary relief but are not a definitive treatment for specific phobias.\n\nSystematic desensitization is a technique often used in exposure therapy, which could be part of a comprehensive cognitive-behavioral therapy approach.\",\n\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
