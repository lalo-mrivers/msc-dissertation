["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about endogenous signaling molecules or receptors that increase insulin sensitivity. The patient is pre-diabetic, indicating impaired glucose tolerance. The papers provided suggest that insulin plays a role in hypoglycemia and cardiovascular function. Fine-tuning insulin therapy implies that physiologic treatment programs can mimic normal insulin action more precisely than ever before. Insulin-resistant patients are treated with glucocorticoids. This information suggests that insulin resistance is associated with impaired glucose tolerance. The patient's blood glucose levels indicate hyperglycemia, which is commonly seen in insulin-resistant states.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
