["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has progressive shortness of breath, fatigue, and chest pain during exercise for the last 6 months. The cardiac examination shows wide splitting of S2 with a loud second component best heard at the 2nd left intercostal space. This suggests a syndrome described in the relevant documents as absent or faint second heart sound, rapid systole and forward collapsing pulse. The description also mentions a prominent cardiac impulse and non-regurgitant or forward collapse of the pulse.\n\nThe absence of risk factors such as smoking and the family history of similar symptoms suggest that coronary artery disease is less likely to be the cause. The loud second component of S2 and the wide splitting also suggests vasodilation, which could be due to an increase in right ventricular preload.\n\nTherefore, considering the patient's symptoms and cardiac findings, increased right ventricular preload is the most likely cause.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
