["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with pain and weakness in his right shoulder after helping his son move. The symptoms worsened with lifting weights at the gym, suggesting that the pain is related to activity and may be due to local pathology rather than a systemic condition. The physical exam reveals prominent weakness of external rotation of the right upper extremity, which is consistent with supraspinatus damage. Additionally, the patient's strength is 1/5 for abduction of the right arm, also supporting the diagnosis of supraspinatus injury.
