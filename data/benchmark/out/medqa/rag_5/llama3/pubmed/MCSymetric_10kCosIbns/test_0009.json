["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about a 23-year-old woman who comes to the physician because she's embarrassed about the appearance of her nails. The patient has no history of serious illness and takes no medications. She appears well. A photograph of the nails is shown. Based on the documents, we know that nail changes can be indicative of systemic disorders. In particular, pigmentation changes in the nails can suggest diseases elsewhere in the body or system. Since the patient's age is 23, it's unlikely she has a developmental abnormality or congenital condition affecting her nails. The question also doesn't mention any nail bed abnormalities that would warrant biopsy.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
