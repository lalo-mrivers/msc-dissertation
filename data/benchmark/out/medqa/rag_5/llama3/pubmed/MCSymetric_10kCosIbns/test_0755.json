["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 31-year-old G1-P0 woman at 28-weeks gestation presenting with shortness of breath and nonspecific right-sided chest pain that worsens with inspiration. She has a history of sinusitis, drinks red wine daily, and denies smoking or illicit drug use. Physical examination reveals decreased air movement in the right lung, a grade 2/6 holosystolic murmur, and a gravid uterus without acute findings. Given her symptoms and physical examination, the most likely diagnosis is pulmonary edema secondary to cardiac overload due to pregnancy.\n\nECG would be an excellent choice to evaluate this patient as it can provide valuable information about cardiac function during pregnancy. ST changes are common in pregnancy, especially after exercise, which might contribute to her symptoms. Additionally, ECG can help rule out other potential causes of the symptoms such as coronary insufficiency or cardiac arrhythmias.\n\nThe other options do not seem as relevant for this patient's presentation and diagnosis.\",\n\"answer_choice\": A"]
