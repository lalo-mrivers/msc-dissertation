["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with progressively worsening hearing loss, constant ear ringing, and episodes of unsteadiness. The physical examination is normal, but the patient has difficulty repeating a sentence on whisper testing. The air conduction audiogram shows that air conduction is greater than bone conduction when the vibrating tuning fork is placed by the ear and then on the mastoid process. This suggests a sensorineural hearing loss rather than a conductive one. Additionally, the patient's symptoms of constant ear ringing and episodes of unsteadiness are also consistent with sensorineural hearing loss. Therefore, we can conclude that the most likely structure impaired in this patient is the cochlea.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
