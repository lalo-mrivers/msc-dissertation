["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The laboratory is investigating whether the ribosome can recognize a mischarged amino acid and still be incorporated into the growing peptide. They have biochemically charged a Lys-tRNA with valine instead of lysine and inserted it into the cell. The mRNA sequence contains only codons for lysine. To determine what will occur, we need to consider how the ribosome recognizes tRNAs and how it handles mischarged amino acids. In this case, the tRNA is charged with valine but contains an anticodon that specifies for lysine. According to the studies on lysine, glutamine, and glutamic acid tRNAs from Drosophila, the acceptor activities of BrCN-treated tRNA-Lys-5 were completely eliminated, suggesting the presence of 2-thiouridine derivatives. Also, in the nucleotide sequence of three isoaccepting lysine tRNAs from rabbit liver and SV40-transformed mouse fibroblasts, it was found that TRNA3Lys has the anticodon S-U-U and contains two highly modified thionucleosides on the 3' side of the anticodon. This suggests that the ribosome may recognize the mischarged tRNA with valine and prevent its incorporation by removing the valine.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
