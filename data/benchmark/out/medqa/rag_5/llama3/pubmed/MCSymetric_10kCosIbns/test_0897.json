["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Given the patient's history of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and current presentation with swelling and pain in both legs, proteinuria on urinalysis, and diffuse oozing of bladder mucosa on cystoscopy, I think the relevant document is 'Systemic lupus erythematosus as seen in primary care' which mentions clinically significant renal involvement occurs in fewer than 10% of patients.
