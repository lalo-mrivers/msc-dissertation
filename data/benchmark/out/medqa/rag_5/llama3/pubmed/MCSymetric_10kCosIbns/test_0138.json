["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has a history of frequent bed wetting at night since he was 4 years old. He has never been dry continuously for 1 week during the night, but there is no evidence of daytime incontinence or urgency. The physical examination and laboratory tests are normal. This suggests that the patient has nocturnal enuresis (bedwetting). The absence of urinary tract infections, frequency, hesitancy, and abnormal findings on urine culture suggests that the enuresis is likely to be primary rather than secondary to another condition. Therefore, further investigation or treatment for underlying causes such as spinal cord lesions is not necessary at this stage.\", \"answer_choice\": B}"]
