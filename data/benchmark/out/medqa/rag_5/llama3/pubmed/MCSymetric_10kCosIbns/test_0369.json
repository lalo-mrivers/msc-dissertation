["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has undergone a thyroidectomy for treatment of Graves' disease. She reports a hoarse voice and difficulty speaking post-operatively. We are looking for the embryologic origin of the damaged nerve that is most likely causing this patient's hoarseness. The relevant documents mention recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN) and superior laryngeal nerve (SLN). RLN paralysis can cause temporary or permanent loss of voice, whereas SLN injury may result in changes to the quality of the voice or even voicelessness.
