["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking which mechanism most likely contributes to the changes seen at point D in the graph. To answer this, we need to understand what happens during digestion of an ordinary meal. The relevant information can be found in the paper 'Measurement of gastric functions during digestion of ordinary solid meals in man'. This study shows that after ingestion of a mixed meal, gastric secretions and emptying rates are measured simultaneously using constant duodenal perfusion with polyethylene glycol (PEG). Acid and pepsin outputs can be determined without manipulation of the intragastric pH. Employing this method, we have simultaneously quantified acid, pepsin, and total secretory outputs; rates of gastric emptying of meal and secretions; and serum gastrin levels during digestion. These data characterize physiological responses to ordinary food in health.\n\nDuring digestion, the stomach secretes acid and pepsin into the duodenum. The rate of gastric emptying is higher for liquids than solids. As the meal enters the small intestine, the hormones gastrin, cholecystokinin (CCK), and secretin are released. These hormones stimulate the gallbladder to release bile and the pancreas to release digestive enzymes into the duodenum.\n\nThe graph shows that at point D, there is a decrease in stomach acid secretion rate and pH of stomach contents. This suggests that the food has entered the small intestine, and the stimulation of gastrin receptors by nutrients in the duodenum has decreased. This mechanism is most likely mediated by the hormone secretin, which is released in response to nutrients entering the duodenum.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C: Increased activity of enterochromaffin-like cells.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
