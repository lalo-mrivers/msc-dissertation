["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 17-year-old girl who has not undergone puberty yet, despite her classmates having gone through it. The examination shows undeveloped breasts (Tanner I stage of development) and normal external and internal female genitalia. Her body mass index is within normal limits, she is in the 40th percentile for height, and she is agreeable and pleasant during the interview. This suggests that the patient's growth velocity is normal. The question mentions that all her classmates have undergone puberty, which implies that early or late appearance of puberty is mainly due to genetic factors. Therefore, I should consider the developmental history of the parents as a possible factor. The absence of specific complaints and vital signs within normal limits also suggests that there might not be any other underlying medical condition.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
