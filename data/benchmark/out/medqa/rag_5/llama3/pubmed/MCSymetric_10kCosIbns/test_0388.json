["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms are regurgitation of breastmilk through his nose and mouth after some feeds. His mother has tried limiting the volume of each feed, which seems to have reduced the frequency of the regurgitation. The patient's growth parameters show a mild decline in height and weight percentiles over the past few weeks. On physical exam, he appears healthy with normoactive bowel sounds.\n\nGiven these symptoms and findings, it is likely that the patient is experiencing forceful expulsion of milk during feeding, which is common in infants around 8-12 weeks old.\n\nThe mother's concern about her milk production not keeping up with the patient's nutritional requirements is also addressed by the history. The patient's growth parameters show a decline over time, suggesting that his nutritional needs may be being met, but not entirely.\n\nGiven this information, I would recommend reassurance and counseling on positioning to address the forceful expulsion of milk during feeding. This would likely involve adjustments to the mother's breastfeeding technique to help the baby latch on more effectively and reduce the regurgitation.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
