["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has a genetic disease that affects her respiratory system. Since the disease is caused by an autosomal recessive pattern, she is a carrier of the mutated gene. Her husband does not have the disease phenotype but comes from a population where the prevalence of the disease is 1/100, which means he could be a carrier as well. To determine the probability that their child will inherit the disease, we need to consider the genotypes and phenotypes of both parents.\n\nThe patient's genotype is 'carrier' (homozygous for the normal allele), and her phenotype is affected by the disease. Her husband's genotype is unknown but could be either 'normal', 'carrier', or 'affected' since he doesn't have the phenotype but comes from a population where the prevalence of the disease is 1/100.\n\nUsing the Punnett square, we can determine the possible genotypes and phenotypes of their offspring:\n\n- Each child has a 50% chance of inheriting the mutated gene from the patient (since she's a carrier).\n- The husband could be a carrier (50%) or unaffected (50%), so each child has a 25% chance of inheriting the mutated gene from him.\n- Since the disease is recessive, if the child inherits two copies of the normal allele (one from each parent), they won't express the disease. If the child inherits one copy of the mutated gene and one copy of the normal allele, they'll be carriers like the patient.\n\nGiven these possibilities, we can calculate the probability that their child will inherit the disease:\n\n- 25% chance of inheriting two copies of the mutated gene (affected phenotype).\n- 50% chance of being a carrier (homozygous for one copy of the normal allele and one copy of the mutated gene).\n\nThe overall probability that their child will have the disease is 0.25 + 0.5 = 0.75, which is equivalent to 3/4.\n\nHowever, since we're looking for the chance that their child will inherit the disease (not just express it), we need to subtract the probability of being a carrier from the overall probability:\n\n- 3/4 - 1/2 = 1/4\n\nSo, the chance that their child will inherit the disease is 1/4, which is equivalent to 25%.\n\nThis result doesn't match any of the given choices. Therefore, I'll choose an answer based on the closest approximation.\n\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
