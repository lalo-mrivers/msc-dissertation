["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the emergence of a virulent strain of a virus. The proposed theory suggests that two viruses from the same family co-infect a host cell, produce genome segments, and then package them into a new virus particle. This process is more likely to occur in RNA viruses due to their high mutation rate. DNA viruses, on the other hand, have a lower error frequency of DNA polymerase and tend to remain latent inside the body. Therefore, the process described is more feasible with RNA viruses.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
