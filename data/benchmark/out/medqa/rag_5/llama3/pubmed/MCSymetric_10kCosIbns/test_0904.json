["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about a 7-year-old boy with progressively worsening swelling around the eyes, moderate periorbital edema, and 2+ pitting edema of the lower extremities bilaterally. The kidney biopsy specimen shows effacement of the podocytes on electron microscopy. This information suggests that the patient may have glomerular damage or nephrotic syndrome. Urinalysis is likely to show proteinuria (excess protein in the urine) and potentially hematuria (blood in the urine). Considering the documents provided, I think step-by-step that a routine urinalysis would be performed to detect any abnormalities, which might include proteinuria, hematuria, or other signs of kidney damage. Therefore, I will look for options that reflect this.\",\n\"answer_choice\": A"]
