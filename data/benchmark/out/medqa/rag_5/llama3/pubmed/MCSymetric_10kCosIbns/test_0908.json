["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 24-year-old primigravida who was previously diagnosed with asymptomatic bacteriuria at 18 weeks gestation. She has been treated with amoxicillin and currently presents without symptoms or concurrent diseases. The current physical examination reveals no abnormalities, including the cervix being soft and non-tender.\n\nAsymptomatic bacteriuria is known to have a high recurrence rate, especially in primigravidas. Therefore, it would be reasonable to perform urine cultures on subsequent antenatal visits to monitor for possible recurrences. Additionally, the patient's history of asymptomatic bacteriuria also suggests an association with intrauterine growth retardation.\n\nIn light of these factors, the most accurate statement is that the patient should have urinalysis performed on each subsequent antenatal visit to screen for possible recurrence of bacteriuria.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
