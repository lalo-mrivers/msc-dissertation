["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with a bilateral, throbbing headache that worsens when coughing or laughing. She has been experiencing this for approximately 3 weeks. The patient's medical history includes stage 1 arterial hypertension and stable angina pectoris. Her current medications include aspirin, rosuvastatin, lisinopril, and isosorbide mononitrate.\n\nThe patient's headache does not seem to be related to nausea, vomiting, photophobia, or phonophobia, which would suggest migraine.
