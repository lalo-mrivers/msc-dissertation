["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the prevention of GERD if alcohol consumption stops. From the given options, we can see that B refers to the total number of people who developed GERD (30) and is independent of alcohol consumption. Options A and D are related to the number of alcoholics who developed GERD, which is not relevant to our question. Option C looks like a fraction but it's not clear how it relates to the prevention of GERD.\n\nAfter analyzing the options, I found that option B refers to the total number of people who developed GERD and does not depend on alcohol consumption. Therefore, if we want to find out what fraction of GERD can be prevented in the general population if alcohol is no longer consumed, we should focus on the percentage of alcoholics who developed GERD.\n\nAccording to the data provided, 30 out of 200 alcoholics developed GERD, which means that about 15% (30/200) of the alcoholics developed GERD. If we stop consuming alcohol, this percentage will decrease to zero in the general population. Therefore, the fraction of GERD that can be prevented is 15%.\n\nThe correct answer is C: (30/200) / (30/400).\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
