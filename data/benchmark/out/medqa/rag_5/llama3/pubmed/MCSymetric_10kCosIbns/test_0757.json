["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is an 18-year-old woman presenting with lightheadedness, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, myalgia, and a generalized rash. She also has fever, tachycardia, and hypotension. The laboratory studies show liver dysfunction (AST 190 U/L, ALT 175 U/L), renal dysfunction (creatinine 1.8 mg/dL), and hyperbilirubinemia (total bilirubin 2.1 mg/dL). These findings are more consistent with a severe systemic illness rather than a minor condition. Given the patient's age and the presence of rash, I think step by step that this patient may have an infectious disease or a toxic reaction.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
