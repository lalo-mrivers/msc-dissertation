["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 5-year-old boy with a history of asthma and hospitalizations. His mother has type 2 diabetes mellitus. He presents with sudden loss of consciousness, somnolence, and diaphoresis. Serum studies show hypoglycemia (glucose = 22 mg/dL) and normal potassium levels. After treatment, his glucose level normalizes, but he has another episode overnight, which is consistent with recurrent hypoglycemic coma. The lab results during the second episode show low insulin levels (<24.9 mIU/L), indicating absent residual beta-cell function, a risk factor for hypoglycemic coma as described in one of the provided documents. This suggests that the boy may have undiagnosed diabetes mellitus or impaired glucose regulation.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
