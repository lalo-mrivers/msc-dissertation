["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 15-year-old girl with irregular menstrual cycles (15-45 days apart) and now presents with amenorrhea for the past 3 months. Menarche was at 14 years old, indicating normal puberty onset. The patient has a history of sexual intercourse and risperidone treatment for a manic episode. Her mother has PCOS, which increases the risk of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) in her. The patient's BMI is 27.02 kg/m2, indicating obesity. Hormone studies show normal prolactin, thyroid-stimulating hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, and luteinizing hormone levels but anovulatory progesterone (<3) and high testosterone (>3.5). Given the history of abnormal menstrual cycles, amenorrhea, and high testosterone, PCOS is a possible diagnosis. However, considering her age, menarche at 14 years old, and normal pelvic examination, it's more likely that anovulation due to hormonal imbalance is the cause of her symptoms.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
