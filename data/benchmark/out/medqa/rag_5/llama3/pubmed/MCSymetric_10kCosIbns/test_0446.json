["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the potential side effects of a class I anti-arrhythmic drug. The document 'Acute hydralazine overdose: marked ECG abnormalities in a young adult' discusses the effects of hydralazine on the heart, including positive inotropic and chronotropic effects, and myocardial cell injury. Since this is not specifically about the class I anti-arrhythmic drug mentioned in the question, we need to look at other documents.\n\nThe document 'Combination anti-arrhythmic drug therapy' discusses various anti-arrhythmic drugs, including class I substances that slow phase 0 depolarization and prolong action potential duration. However, this does not provide specific information about side effects.\n\nThe document 'Neurological complications of drug abuse' is not relevant to the question.\n\nThe document 'Precipitation of heart failure following sudden withdrawal of hydralazine' discusses the consequences of suddenly stopping hydralazine therapy, but it does not mention the potential side effects of the class I anti-arrhythmic drug.\n\nThe document 'Adverse drug reactions and death. A review of 827 cases.' provides a general overview of adverse drug reactions, including autopsies done on 827 patients. However, this is too broad to be relevant to the specific question about the potential side effects of the class I anti-arrhythmic drug.\n\nThe key point is that the class I anti-arrhythmic drug mentioned in the question has mild anticholinergic and alpha-blocking activity. Anticholinergic symptoms include tinnitus and headache, which are listed as options A. Therefore, the most likely side effects of the drug are headache and tinnitus.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
