["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the probability that the second daughter is a carrier of hemophilia A. Since the daughters are unaffected, it means they cannot be homozygous for the disease, as they would exhibit symptoms. Therefore, the only possibility is that one of their X chromosomes carries the affected allele, making them carriers. The question does not provide information about the inheritance pattern of the disease or the genetic makeup of the father and mother. However, we can make an educated guess based on the fact that hemophilia A is X-linked recessive. This means that if the mother is a carrier, there is a 50% chance she will pass the affected allele to each daughter.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
