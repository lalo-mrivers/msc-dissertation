["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has a diagnosis of acute appendicitis and is undergoing laparoscopic appendectomy. The appendix is gangrenous and perforated with purulent fluid in the pelvis. The patient shows muscle rigidity and profuse diaphoresis after the appendiceal base is ligated, which suggests malignant hyperthermia (MH). MH is a rare but serious complication of anesthesia that can be triggered by certain medications, including haloperidol, which the patient is taking for his psychosis.\n\nThe patient's symptoms, such as muscle rigidity and profuse diaphoresis, are consistent with MH.
