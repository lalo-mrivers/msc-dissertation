["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 17-year-old woman who has been experiencing amenorrhea for 4 months. She had regular periods until two months ago and denies sexual activity. Her physical examination reveals enlarged cheeks bilaterally and calluses on the dorsum of her hands, which are consistent with binge eating. Given her history of regular menstrual cycles and the sudden onset of amenorrhea, I would suspect an endocrine disorder rather than a gynecologic problem. The patient's BMI is 21 kg/m^2, which suggests that she is not underweight or obese. Her negative urine pregnancy test rules out pregnancy as a cause of her amenorrhea. Given these findings, I would expect to see other signs of hyperthyroidism, such as tachycardia, heat intolerance, and weight loss.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
