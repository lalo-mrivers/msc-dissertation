["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has chronic hepatitis B virus infection, elevated α-fetoprotein levels, and a liver mass detected by CT scan. We have two patients with liver cirrhosis who presented with α-fetoprotein values diagnostic of hepatocarcinoma but without evidence of neoplasms. Another patient had a strong elevation of α-fetoprotein in alcoholic hepatitis during the acute phase, which normalized as clinical improvement developed. The case studies suggest that elevated α-fetoprotein levels can be seen in non-neoplastic liver diseases such as chronic hepatitis. Given the presence of chronic hepatitis B virus infection and the association between hepatitis B surface antigen and serum alpha-fetoprotein elevation in chronic active hepatitis, cirrhosis, and acute hepatitis, it is likely that the patient's condition is caused by a liver disease rather than a neoplasm.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
