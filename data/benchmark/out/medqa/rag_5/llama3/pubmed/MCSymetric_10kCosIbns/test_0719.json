["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents are about bisphosphoglycerate mutase and its related enzymes. The main point is that this enzyme has multifunctional properties and can be activated by different bisphosphoglycerates. It also has an amino group essential for binding of these bisphosphoglycerates. Based on this, it's likely that the cells with elevated intracellular concentration of bisphosphoglycerate mutase will have a higher level of related enzymes or activators. Therefore, the answer is likely to be a enzyme that is not directly related to bisphosphoglycerate metabolism.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B\n}"]
