["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks why the patient should not be switched to exenatide. Exenatide is an injectable drug that only needs to be administered once a week. Since the patient's blood glucose levels have been difficult to control on his current insulin regimen due to poor adherence, we need to look for information about exenatide's mechanism of action and potential contraindications. From the provided documents, we can see that exendin-4 (exenatide) interacts with a putative receptor on pancreatic acinar cells, which predicts the existence of an endogenous mammalian analog. This suggests that exenatide works by stimulating glucose-dependent insulin secretion, rather than suppressing glucagon secretion. Additionally, there is no information in the provided documents about contraindications for children below 18 years old. The patient's BMI (19 kg/m2) does not seem to be a relevant factor in this case. Therefore, we can conclude that exenatide suppresses glucagon secretion, which increases the risk of hypoglycemia.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
