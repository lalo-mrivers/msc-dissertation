["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's blood pressure drops to 80/60 mm Hg and her pulse is 124/min, which suggests that she has experienced a hypovolemic shock. After administering fluids and whole blood, her vitals stabilize. This indicates that the patient had a significant loss of blood volume, likely due to postpartum hemorrhage. Since lactation failure occurs in this patient after the stabilization of her vital signs, it is unlikely caused by any pituitary-related issue. Instead, it is more plausible that the patient's hormonal balance has been disrupted due to the massive blood loss. This could have led to a decrease in prolactin levels, making lactation difficult or impossible.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
