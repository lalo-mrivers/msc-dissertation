["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided, we are looking for the tubular fluid-to-plasma concentration ratio of urea. The graph shown in figure A is not available, so we need to analyze the relevant documents. From the first document, 'Urea secretion by the straight segment of the proximal tubule', we know that there was a collected-to-perfused ratio of [14C]urea, corrected for volume marker change, which was 1.07 +/- 0.01 in superficial and 1.09 +/- 0.01 in juxtamedullary nephrons. This indicates net secretion in both segments. Since the tubular fluid-to-plasma concentration ratio is a measure of the relative concentrations between the tubular fluid and plasma, it can be inferred that the tubular fluid-to-plasma concentration ratio of urea is greater than 1, indicating an increase in concentration from plasma to tubular fluid.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
