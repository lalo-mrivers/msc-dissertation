["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has a grape-like mass protruding from her vagina for the last 15 days, which suggests vaginal bleeding. The USG examination shows no fetal parts, which implies that the fetus may have already been delivered or may not be viable. Given the presence of placental fragments in the vagina, it is likely that there was an extramembranous pregnancy, as described in one of the case reports.
