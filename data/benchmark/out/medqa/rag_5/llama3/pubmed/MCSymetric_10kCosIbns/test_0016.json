["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 7-year-old boy with asthma who experiences exacerbation of symptoms in springtime, especially when the new flowers are blooming. He has been advised to take more precautions during this seasonal change and to stay away from pollen. This suggests that his asthma is triggered by allergens, specifically pollen. The experimental therapy being considered targets a mediator that favors class switching of antibodies, which would eventually reduce the exaggerated response observed during asthmatic attacks even when exposed to an allergen. Therefore, the targeted mediator must be involved in the allergic response and antibody production.\n\nThe choice among IL-2, IL-10, IL-13, and IL-4 is not obvious from the information provided, as all of these cytokines can play a role in the immune response and antibody production. However, since the patient's symptoms are triggered by pollen exposure and the experimental therapy targets a mediator that favors class switching of antibodies, it is likely that the targeted mediator is involved in the IgE response.\n\nIL-4 is a cytokine that plays a key role in the IgE response, favoring the class switching of B cells to produce IgE antibodies. Therefore, based on this information, the most likely answer is D: IL-4.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
