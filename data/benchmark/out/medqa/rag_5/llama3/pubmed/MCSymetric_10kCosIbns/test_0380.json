["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the patient's symptoms of shortness of breath and cough of sudden onset while sleeping, I consider noncardiogenic pulmonary edema as a possibility. The patient's past medical history of type II diabetes and current medications such as lisinopril, metformin, insulin, and fish oil do not suggest cardiogenic pulmonary edema.

The patient's lab values do not indicate any clear evidence of metabolic or renal abnormalities that would explain the presentation.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
