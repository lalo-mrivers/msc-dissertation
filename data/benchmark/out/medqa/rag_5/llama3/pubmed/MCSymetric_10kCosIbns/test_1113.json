["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about a 15-year-old girl who has genital lesions. She is sexually active with multiple partners and uses condoms inconsistently. The lesions are hyperkeratotic exophytic papules that turn white on application of 3% acetic acid. Based on the symptoms, it's likely that the patient has condylomata acuminata (genital warts). The fact that she is sexually active with multiple partners and uses condoms inconsistently suggests that the lesions are caused by a sexually transmitted infection. The use of 3% acetic acid to turn white the lesions further supports this diagnosis. Therefore, the most likely cause of the patient's condition is sexual transmission.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
