["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking which step in cross-bridge cycling will be blocked by a drug that selectively inhibits phosphate release by the myosin head. According to the documents, the exchange reaction of 32Pi into ATP during ATP hydrolysis and its dependence on the interaction of actin and myosin suggests the existence of an 'energy-rich' actin -- myosin -- nucleoside-diphosphate intermediate during the cross-bridge cycle. Since the drug inhibits phosphate release, it is likely that the step most affected will be the exchange reaction where 32Pi incorporates into ATP.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
