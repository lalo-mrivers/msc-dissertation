["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the location of ribosomes in protein-secreting cells. From the provided documents, we can see that ribosomes are known to interact with rough endoplasmic membranes (from '[The role of ribosomal proteins in in vitro ribosome-membrane interactions]'), and this interaction plays a crucial role in protein synthesis. Therefore, it is likely that the essential location of ribosomes for protein-secreting cells is on the rough endoplasmic reticulum.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
