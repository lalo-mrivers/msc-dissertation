["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with urinary incontinence, difficulty urinating, incomplete voiding, and dull pain in the suprapubic region. Given her history of diabetes mellitus and poorly controlled type 2 diabetes for 8 years, I suspect that there may be a correlation between retention of urine and diabetes.
