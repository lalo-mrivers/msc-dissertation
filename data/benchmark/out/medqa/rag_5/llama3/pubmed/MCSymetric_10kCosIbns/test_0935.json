["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the cells that show an absolute increase in the complete blood count. The relevant documents provided are mostly related to gynecology and breast cancer screening, but one of them discusses menstrual blood loss. However, it doesn't seem directly relevant to this question.\n\nAnother document mentions a study on middle-aged women's blood pressure, which could be somewhat related to cardiovascular health, but not specifically to the cells mentioned in the question.\n\nThe most relevant information is that there are no specific complaints from the patient, her vital signs and physical examination are within normal limits, and she has an absolute increase in certain cells. This suggests that the focus should be on understanding more about these cells rather than drawing parallels with other studies.\n\nOne document mentions a study on menstrual blood loss, which could potentially relate to the cells mentioned in the question, but it doesn't provide direct information about these cells. Therefore, we need to rely on our general medical knowledge and available data to answer this question.\n\nThe cells that show an increase are likely neutrophils or lymphocytes, as they are typically the most common types of white blood cells. Neutrophils normally constitute 25-40% of total leucocyte count (Option C), which fits with the given information. However, since we don't have direct evidence about these cells, we must rely on general knowledge and make an educated guess.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
