["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 10-year-old boy with a painless mass in the left testicle. The tumor markers AFP and hCG are elevated, with AFP being significantly higher than normal (350 ng/mL). The biopsy shows glomeruli-like structures with a central capillary within a mesodermal core, lined by flattened layers of germ cells. Given these findings, it is likely that the mass is a type of testicular neoplasm. Since the patient is young and the tumor markers are elevated, particularly AFP, I think of yolk sac tumors as they often present in childhood and have high AFP levels. The biopsy finding of glomeruli-like structures also supports this diagnosis.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
