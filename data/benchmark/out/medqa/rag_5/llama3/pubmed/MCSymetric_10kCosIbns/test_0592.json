["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the expected beneficial effect of a second drug when combined with interferon-alpha therapy for chronic hepatitis C. Interferon-alpha leads to responses in about 50% of patients suffering from chronic hepatitis C. A 24-week treatment is frequently (approx. 50%) followed by relapses reducing the percentage of lasting responders to approx. 20%. The patients who relapse are sensitive to retreatment with interferon-alpha. Since the patient has a history of progressive fatigue, scleral icterus, and is positive for hepatitis C RNA, it is likely that the second drug is being used to treat chronic hepatitis C. In this case, the expected beneficial effect of the additional drug would be due to inhibition of an enzyme involved in HCV replication.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
