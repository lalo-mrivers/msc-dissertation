["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the area of the body that would contain the lowest oxygen content at both time points. From the provided documents, we know that during exercise, arterial PO2 (PaO2) increases due to several factors including a rise in R and a fall in PaCO2. This means that the oxygen saturation in arterial blood increases after exercise. The pulmonary artery is responsible for transporting deoxygenated blood from the body back to the lungs. Since it contains deoxygenated blood, its oxygen content would be low before exercise. After exercise, the increased PaO2 would also result in higher oxygen levels in the pulmonary artery. Therefore, the pulmonary artery would contain the lowest oxygen content at both time points.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
