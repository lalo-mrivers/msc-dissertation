["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with a dry cough, fever, and chills after working at the zoo. He has a history of childhood asthma and is exposed to birds daily. The chest X-ray shows diffuse haziness in both lower lung fields, which could be consistent with occupational bronchial allergy.
