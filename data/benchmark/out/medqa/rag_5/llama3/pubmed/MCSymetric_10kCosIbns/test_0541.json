["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the provided documents, we know that education level has been studied as a predictor of sudden coronary death after myocardial infarction. A study found that men with little education who had complex ventricular premature beats in the monitoring hour had over three times the risk of sudden coronary death compared to better educated men with the same arrhythmia. This suggests that low educational status may be associated with an increased risk of sudden coronary death after myocardial infarction.\n\nIn this study, we computed an odds ratio of 2.1 for the association between low education and the risk of MI, with a confidence interval of 0.9â€“9.7. While the p-value is not provided, the confidence interval suggests that the observed association may be statistically significant.\n\nBased on these findings, it appears that there is an association between young age MI and educational status. Specifically, low educational status may be associated with an increased risk of myocardial infarction at a young age.\", \"answer_choice\": C}"]
