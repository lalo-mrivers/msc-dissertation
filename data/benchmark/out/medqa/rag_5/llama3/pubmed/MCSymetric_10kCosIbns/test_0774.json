["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the kidney's altered physiology and pathology in sickle cell anemia. In the early stages of the disease, the renal medulla is impaired in its ability to concentrate and acidify urine, while the cortex functions supranormally. Renal insufficiency can supervene in a subgroup of patients, with glomerulopathy differing between children and adults. Hematuria and papillary necrosis are complications that may occur. Nephrotic syndrome, glomerulonephritis, and progressive renal failure have been reported to occur on occasion in sickle cell disease.\n\nThe documents also describe the pathophysiology of the associated nephropathy, including immune complex glomerulonephritis due to tubular injury with release of renal tubular antigen into the circulation. This leads to an autologous immune complex nephritis, characterized by membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis and granular deposits along the glomerular basement membrane.\n\nConsidering these facts, it is clear that sickle cell disease can indeed adversely affect the kidneys, leading to various complications including renal insufficiency, hematuria, papillary necrosis, nephrotic syndrome, and glomerulonephritis. The question asks which of the options is a renal complication of sickle cell disease.\n\nThe documents do not specifically mention membranous glomerulonephritis as a complication, but rather describe membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis. Proximal renal tubular acidosis is mentioned as an impaired function of the renal medulla in the early stages of the disease, which suggests that it may be a precursor to other complications rather than a distinct complication itself.\n\nImpaired urine diluting ability and impaired urine concentration ability are both described as impaired functions of the renal medulla in the early stages of the disease, but they do not seem to be specific complications themselves.\n\nTherefore, considering all these points, the most likely answer is:\n\nD: Impaired urine concentration ability\"\n\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
