["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"After reviewing the relevant documents, it is clear that darunavir's mechanism of action is not explicitly stated. However, we can infer that since darunavir is an HIV-1 RT-specific inhibitor, its mechanism of action likely involves inhibiting viral replication by targeting the reverse transcriptase enzyme. DN501 shares a similar mechanism of action with darunavir, so it is reasonable to assume that DN501 also targets the reverse transcriptase enzyme and inhibits viral replication.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
