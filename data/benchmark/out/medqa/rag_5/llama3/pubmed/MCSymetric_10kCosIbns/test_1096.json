["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, we can see that staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome (SSSS) is a condition characterized by bullae formation and subsequent exfoliation. The symptoms described in the question, such as red scaly plaques over both ears with erythema and tenderness, are consistent with SSSS. Additionally, the mention of new jewelry being given to the patient suggests that the earrings may be contaminated with Staphylococcus aureus, which is a common cause of SSSS.\n\nGiven this information, we can rule out options A (Type I–anaphylactic hypersensitivity reaction) and B (Type III–immune complex-mediated hypersensitivity reaction), as they are not related to the symptoms described or the potential bacterial contamination of the earrings. Option D (Type III and IV–mixed immune complex and cell-mediated hypersensitivity reactions) is also unlikely, as SSSS is typically caused by an extracellular toxin rather than an immune response.\n\nThe correct answer is C (Type IV–cell-mediated (delayed) hypersensitivity reaction), which is consistent with the delayed onset of symptoms and the involvement of Staphylococcus aureus.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"]
