["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Given the patient's history of a prior cesarean section due to a non-reassuring fetal heart rate, it is important to consider the risk of uterine rupture. The patient is currently experiencing contractions and has a dilated cervix. According to the relevant documents, a remarkable incidence peak of uterine contractions is seen around the 32nd week of pregnancy, which is higher than the current gestational age of 26 weeks. Additionally, the patient's history of recurrent painful ulcers on her vulva may be related to a prior pelvic inflammatory disease or endometritis, which could also increase the risk of uterine rupture. Therefore, it is crucial to consider these factors and prioritize the patient's safety.\n\nAccording to the document 'Labor after prior cesarean section', a scar in the active segment of the uterus is considered an absolute contraindication to labor. However, since the patient has already experienced labor and delivery previously, it can be inferred that her previous uterine incision was not in the active segment.\n\nGiven these factors, the most appropriate next step in management would be to monitor the patient's fetal heart rate and uterine activity closely, taking into account the risk of uterine rupture. If the contractions continue or worsen, tocolysis may be considered, as per the document 'Physiology of uterine contractions'.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
