["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has monoclonal gammopathy with 6% monoclonal plasma cells in the bone marrow biopsy. The study suggests that PBL from patients with multiple myeloma demonstrated responses to autologous or allogeneic myeloma plasma cells. This implies that there is a cytotoxic response to abnormal plasma cells by peripheral blood leukocytes. Further analysis shows downregulation of class I major histocompatibility molecules in the monoclonal plasma cells, which suggests that these cells are not recognized as self and can be targeted by immune cells. Therefore, we should consider the immune cell that can lyse abnormal cells without the need for opsonization, priming, or prior activation. The study indicates that PBL from patients with multiple myeloma demonstrated responses to autologous or allogeneic myeloma plasma cells, which suggests that natural killer (NK) cells may be involved in this response.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
