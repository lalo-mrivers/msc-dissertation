["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has a history of myocardial infarction and presents with dyspnea on exertion, swollen feet, and ankles. On exam, an elevated JVP (jugular venous pressure) is noted, which suggests increased blood volume in the circulation. This, along with pitting edema of bilateral lower extremities, suggests a possible left-sided heart failure. As the patient's history and physical examination findings are more consistent with right-sided heart failure than left-sided heart failure, it can be assumed that there might be some sort of obstruction or constriction on the tricuspid valve level. Given these findings, the most likely explanation for this patient's lower extremity edema is an increase in interstitial fluid pressure.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
