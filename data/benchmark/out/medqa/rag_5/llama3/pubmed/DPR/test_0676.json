This suggests pneumonia, which was later confirmed by sputum culture. The patient died despite appropriate therapy. In the photomicrograph, the cell-type indicated by the arrow is not specified, but it could be an inflammatory response. Platelet activating factor (PAF) is a potent chemotactic agent that can attract immune cells to the site of inflammation. Interferon-gamma (IFN-Î³) is also known to play a role in inflammatory responses. Leukotriene D4 is a mediator involved in bronchoconstriction, but it's not directly related to the cell-type indicated by the arrow.
