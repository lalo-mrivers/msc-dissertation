["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) sets standards for resident work hours. The maximum number of work hours per week is 80, with a maximum of 16 consecutive hours of duty time followed by at least 5 hours off. Since the resident already works 60 hours per week and has an external shift on Saturdays, we need to consider their overall workload.
