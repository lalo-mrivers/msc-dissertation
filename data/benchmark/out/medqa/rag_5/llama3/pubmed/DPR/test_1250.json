["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's CD4 count decreased and viral load increased despite ongoing treatment, indicating that the current regimen is not effective. The new drug should act by preventing viral DNA synthesis without undergoing intracellular phosphorylation. This suggests that a nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) is being used to treat HIV. Among the options, Lamivudine (D) is an NRTI that works by blocking the incorporation of nucleotides into viral DNA, but it requires phosphorylation for its activity. Therefore, this option does not fit the description. Efavirenz (A), Ritonavir (B), and Raltegravir (C) are all non-NRTIs that work through different mechanisms.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
