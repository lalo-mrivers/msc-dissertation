["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the probability of the second daughter being a carrier of inherited hemophilia A. Since the first daughter is unaffected, it's certain that she's not a carrier. The father has inherited hemophilia A, so he's a carrier. The mother is not affected and therefore not a carrier either. This is because each child inherits one X chromosome from their mother and one Y or X chromosome from their father. Since the father is a carrier, it means he has one normal X chromosome and one abnormal X chromosome (carrying the mutation). There's a 50% chance that each daughter inherits the abnormal X chromosome, which would make her a carrier. However, the first daughter is not a carrier, so the second daughter can't be the same as the first. Therefore, there's still a 50% chance that the second daughter is a carrier.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
