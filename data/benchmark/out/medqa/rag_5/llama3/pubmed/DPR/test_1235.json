["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has a disease that is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. The prevalence of the disease is 1/100. Since the mother has the disease, she is homozygous for the recessive allele (rr). The father does not have the disease but could be either heterozygous (Rr) or homozygous normal (RR). The possible genotypes and phenotypes of their child are: Rr - carrier (will not express the disease), rr - affected. Therefore, the probability that the child will be affected is 1/2 (50%).\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
