["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 62-year-old woman with a history of progressive pain and stiffness of the fingers of her right hand. She recently retired from working as a typist for 28 years, which suggests that her symptoms may be related to repetitive strain injury or occupational factors. The physical examination shows swelling, joint-line tenderness, and decreased range of motion, consistent with degenerative changes in the joints.
