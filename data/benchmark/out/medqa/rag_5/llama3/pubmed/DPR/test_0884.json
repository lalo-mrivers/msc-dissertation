["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the ribosome location in protein-secreting cells. Since these cells synthesize proteins that are secreted outside the cell, it's likely that the ribosomes involved are located near the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) where protein synthesis and modification occur before secretion. This suggests that the correct answer should be related to the ER.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
