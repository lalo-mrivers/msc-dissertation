["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the side effects of a class I anti-arrhythmic drug. The drug slows phase 0 depolarization in ventricular muscle fibers, blocks potassium channels and prolongs action potential duration, but does not shorten phase 3 repolarization. It also has mild anticholinergic and alpha-blocking activity. The patient is at risk of developing side effects due to the high dose taken. Based on the properties of the drug, the most likely side effects are related to its potassium-channel blocking and anticholinergic activities. Headache and tinnitus are possible side effects due to anticholinergic activity.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
