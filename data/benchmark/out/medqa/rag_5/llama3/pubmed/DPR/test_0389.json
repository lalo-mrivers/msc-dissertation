["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has a deficit in vibration sense and light touch on the left lower extremity, as well as a loss of pain and temperature sensation in the right lower extremity. This suggests a lesion affecting multiple modalities (vibration, light touch, pain, temperature) on one side and a separate lesion affecting pain and temperature sensation on the opposite side. The patient also has weakness in his left leg, which is not necessarily related to the sensory deficits but suggests some motor involvement. Considering the location of the lesion based on the symptoms, it is likely that the lesion is located higher up in the spinal cord rather than at a peripheral level.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D\n}"]
