["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms are consistent with panic disorder, specifically panic attacks. The patient experiences recurring episodes of intense fear or anxiety accompanied by physical symptoms such as chest discomfort, shortness of breath, shakiness, and sweating. The patient has no past medical history and the physical exam is unremarkable.\n\nConsidering the options, Citalopram and Quetiapine are antidepressant medications that may not be effective in managing panic disorder. Lithium is a mood stabilizer that is typically used to treat bipolar disorder or depression.\n\nPropranolol, on the other hand, is a beta blocker medication commonly used to treat anxiety disorders, including panic disorder. It can help reduce symptoms such as rapid heartbeat and trembling associated with panic attacks.\n\nGiven the patient's symptoms and the options available, Propranolol appears to be the best medication for long-term management of their condition.\", \"answer_choice\": C}"]
