["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with sinus tachycardia on ECG, elevated pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, and troponins. The physical exam notes bruising over the chest wall, which suggests trauma to the thoracic area. The patient is complaining of chest pain, which could be due to a variety of reasons. Given the presence of trauma, cardiac contusion is a possible diagnosis. However, the elevated pulmonary capillary wedge pressure and troponins suggest that there may be some underlying cardiac damage as well. The fact that the patient's oxygen saturation is 98% on room air suggests that there is no significant respiratory compromise. Therefore, based on the clinical presentation, I would conclude that the most likely diagnosis is a combination of cardiac contusion and pulmonary contusion.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
