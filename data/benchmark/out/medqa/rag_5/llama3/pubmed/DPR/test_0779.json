["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 29-year-old man who has just been involved in a motor vehicle accident. He is bleeding from scalp and trunk lacerations, but his vital signs are within normal limits. Considering the physical exam findings and the patient's overall condition, it is likely that the patient is experiencing an acute stress response due to the trauma. This would lead to increased levels of norepinephrine, which is a key neurotransmitter involved in this response. As a result, I would expect to see increased norepinephrine at the sinoatrial node, leading to tachycardia and other sympathetic responses.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
