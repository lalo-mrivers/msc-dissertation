["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The new experimental drug prevents the degradation of incretins at the endothelium, increasing glucose-dependent insulin production. This mechanism is similar to Sitagliptin, which works by inhibiting DPP-4 (dipeptidyl peptidase-4), an enzyme that breaks down incretins. The other options do not have a mechanism of action related to incretin degradation or enhancement.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
