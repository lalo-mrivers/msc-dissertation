["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To calculate the required dosage of amoxicillin, we need to determine the total daily dose. The plasma clearance is 15 L/h, which means the drug is cleared from the body at a rate of 15 L/hour. Since the patient needs to maintain a steady state, we want to ensure that the total amount of drug in the body remains constant. To achieve this, we need to calculate the daily dose of amoxicillin.\n\nThe bioavailability of the drug is 75%, which means that only 75% of the administered dose reaches the systemic circulation. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) for the causative pathogen is 1 μg/mL. We want to achieve a target plasma concentration of 2 mg/L, which is equivalent to 2000 μg/L.\n\nTo calculate the total daily dose, we need to determine the amount of drug required to reach this target plasma concentration. First, let's convert the target plasma concentration from mg/L to μg/L: 2000 μg/L.\n\nNext, let's use the formula for calculating the total daily dose:\n\nTotal Daily Dose = (Target Plasma Concentration / MIC) * Bioavailability\n\nSubstituting the values, we get:\n\nTotal Daily Dose = (2000 μg/L / 1 μg/mL) * 75%\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\nTotal Daily Dose = 1500 mg/day\n\nSince the drug is administered twice a day, the required dosage at each dosing interval is half of the total daily dose:\n\nRequired Dosage per Dosing Interval = 1500 mg/day / 2 = 750 mg/dose\", \n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
