["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus and is already taking metformin. The addition of another antidiabetic drug led to improved blood glucose readings and weight gain. This suggests that the added drug may be a insulin secretagogue or an insulin sensitizer, which would not cause significant weight loss. Rosiglitazone is an insulin sensitizer that can cause weight gain. Empagliflozin and liraglutide are glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists that can also cause weight loss. Glyburide is a sulfonylurea that can cause hypoglycemia rather than weight gain. Therefore, the most likely drug added to the patient's regimen is Rosiglitazone.\", \"answer_choice\": C}"]
