["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 31-year-old woman with a 5-month history of intermittent flank pain, bilateral upper abdominal masses, and multiple anechoic parenchymal masses on renal ultrasonography. She has had five urinary tract infections over the past two years and her blood pressure is elevated at 150/88 mm Hg.
