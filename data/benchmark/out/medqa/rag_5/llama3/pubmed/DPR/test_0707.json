["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with symptoms of vomiting and diarrhea, suggesting a possible gastrointestinal infection. Given the severity of her symptoms, dehydration is likely to be an issue. The fact that she's been able to drink sips of water suggests some rehydration has occurred. The blood pressure and heart rate are normal, indicating no significant fluid loss or electrolyte imbalance. To understand where most sodium reabsorption occurs in the patient's kidneys, we need to consider the pathophysiology of dehydration. In this case, sodium reabsorption would be impaired due to the osmotic diuretic effect of the gastrointestinal infection. As a result, the proximal tubule would be affected more significantly than the distal tubule.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
