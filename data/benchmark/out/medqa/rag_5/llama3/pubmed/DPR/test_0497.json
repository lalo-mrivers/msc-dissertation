["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with blurred vision, pain during eye movement, and optic disk swelling in the right eye. The pupillary reaction is abnormal, showing mild bilateral dilation with right eye illumination and bilateral constriction with left eye illumination. This suggests a problem with cranial nerve III (oculomotor) function. Additionally, decreased color perception in the right eye indicates damage to the optic pathway.
