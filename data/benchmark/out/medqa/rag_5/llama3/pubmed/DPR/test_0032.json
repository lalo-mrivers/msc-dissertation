["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient had a history of bacterial meningitis and was hospitalized 5 weeks ago. The laboratory studies show a hemoglobin concentration of 9.0 g/dL, a leukocyte count of 1,100/mm3 with 30% segmented neutrophils, and a platelet count of 20,000/mm3 . Blood cultures grow coagulase-negative staphylococci. The patient was likely treated with an antibiotic during the previous hospitalization.
