["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is experiencing episodic chest pain with a squeezing and tightness sensation. The pain is not associated with food or exercise, but the patient can still climb up to her fourth-floor apartment without issue. The EKG in the office is normal, but 24-hour ECG monitoring shows transient ST elevations during episodes of pain that resolve completely. This suggests an abnormality in cardiac function, rather than a structural problem like myocardial infarction or aortic dissection. Costochondritis can cause chest pain, but it is unlikely to produce the described pattern of transient ST elevations on ECG monitoring. Raynaud's phenomenon is not typically associated with chest pain. Therefore, the mechanism of this patient's chest pain is most similar to costochondritis.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
