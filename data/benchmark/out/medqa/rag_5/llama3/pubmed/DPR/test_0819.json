["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 17-year-old girl who has not attained menarche. She has normal breast development but no uterus or ovaries detected by ultrasonography. The examination shows a firm, nontender left inguinal mass and a blind vaginal pouch. Considering the normal breast development and absence of ovaries, it is unlikely that she has Turner syndrome (45,X) which typically presents with short stature and streak ovaries. Therefore, I am focusing on disorders that affect sexual development without involving the ovaries. The presence of scant axillary hair suggests some degree of androgen insensitivity. However, the patient's height and weight are normal, suggesting that she is not a classic case of Turner syndrome or Mayer-Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser syndrome (MRKH). Based on these findings, I am considering disorders related to sex development and androgen insensitivity. Among the options, 5-α reductase deficiency is the most likely cause as it can lead to absent uterus, ovaries, or both, and is often associated with normal breast development.\",\n\"answer_choice\": A"]
