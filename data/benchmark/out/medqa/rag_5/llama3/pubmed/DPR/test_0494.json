["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the likely pregnancy type given the characteristics of the newborns. The key features are the size difference between the two newborns (2050g vs 2850g), the hematocrit values, and the physical examination findings of one newborn having a flattened nose and left-sided clubfoot. These findings suggest that both newborns may be part of a single placenta, which is supported by the higher hematocrit value in the larger newborn compared to the smaller one. The physical examination findings are consistent with twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS), a complication of monochorionic placentation. Therefore, it is likely that the pregnancy was monochorionic-diamniotic monozygotic.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
