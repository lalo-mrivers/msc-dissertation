["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has asthma exacerbated by pollen exposure. The experimental therapy targets a mediator that favors class switching of antibodies. This suggests that the mediator is involved in an allergic response. IL-4 is a key cytokine involved in IgE production and class switching, which fits with the description. IL-2 is not directly related to allergic responses. IL-10 can inhibit immune responses, but it's not primarily involved in class switching. IL-13 is also not directly involved in class switching. Therefore, the correct answer is D: IL-4.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
