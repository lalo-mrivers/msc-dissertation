["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with progressive shortness of breath, fatigue, and chest pain during exercise. The cardiac examination shows wide splitting of S2, which suggests a delay in the closure of the mitral valve relative to the tricuspid valve. This is typically seen in patients with pulmonary hypertension. The presence of a loud second component of S2 heard at the 2nd left intercostal space also supports this diagnosis.\n\nThe patient's family history and lack of smoking suggest that this may be an inherited condition. Based on these findings, I believe that the most likely cause of this patient's cardiac findings is pulmonary hypertension, which would result in increased right ventricular afterload (C).\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
