["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's glucose tolerance test shows a fasting blood glucose level of 120 mg/dL and a two-hour post-75g glucose load blood glucose level of 190 mg/dL, indicating impaired glucose tolerance. This is classified as pre-diabetic or at risk of developing diabetes. To increase insulin sensitivity in this patient, we need to consider molecules or receptors that can improve the body's response to insulin. Glucocorticoids are actually known to have adverse effects on glucose metabolism and would not be a suitable choice. Catecholamines, which include adrenaline and noradrenaline, can affect blood sugar levels but do not specifically increase insulin sensitivity. Glucagon is an important hormone for glucose regulation but its role in increasing insulin sensitivity is unclear.\n\nThe correct answer is Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ), which is a nuclear receptor involved in the regulation of glucose and lipid metabolism. Activation of PPARγ has been shown to increase insulin sensitivity by improving glucose uptake in skeletal muscle, suppressing gluconeogenesis in liver, and enhancing glycogen synthesis.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
