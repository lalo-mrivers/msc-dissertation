["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the relationship between lung volume and transpulmonary pressure. The graph measures lung and thoracic compliance at different system pressures, which suggests that it's related to the static lung volume rather than tidal or inspiratory volumes. This eliminates options B and A. Functional residual capacity is the amount of air in the lungs at the end of a normal breath, which might be measured in this context. However, total lung capacity is the maximum amount of air the lungs can hold, which is not directly related to the graph. Therefore, option C, functional residual capacity, is the most likely answer.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"]
