["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 16-year-old female who presents with primary amenorrhea. She has never had a period despite normal breast development and growth spurt at age 13. She also experiences headaches every few months with photosensitivity and nausea, which are relieved by ibuprofen. The patient's laboratory studies show normal electrolyte levels, renal function, liver enzymes, and hormone levels. The abdominal ultrasound shows a normal uterus and ovaries. Given the presence of normal breast development and absent menstruation, the most likely diagnosis is primary amenorrhea. Since the patient has never had a period, it is unlikely to be due to hyperprolactinemia or vaginal septum. An imperforate hymen could cause primary amenorrhea, but the patient's laboratory studies and ultrasound do not support this diagnosis. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is D: Normal development.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
