["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the effects of ATP2A1 gene mutation on muscle relaxation time and cytosolic calcium concentration. The ATP2A1 gene codes for the calcium ATPase pump, which pumps calcium out of the sarcoplasmic reticulum in skeletal muscles. With a loss-of-function mutation, the calcium ATPase pump is dysfunctional, leading to an accumulation of calcium in the sarcoplasmic reticulum and ultimately in the cytosol. This would result in an increase in cytosolic calcium concentration.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A: Muscle relaxation time: decreased, cytosolic calcium concentration: increased\"\n}"]
