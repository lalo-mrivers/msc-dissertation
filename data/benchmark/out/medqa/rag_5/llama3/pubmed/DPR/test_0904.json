["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 7-year-old boy with progressively worsening swelling around the eyes, moderate periorbital edema, and 2+ pitting edema of the lower extremities bilaterally. He had a recent episode of sore throat and cough that resolved spontaneously. The kidney biopsy specimen shows effacement of the podocytes on electron microscopy. Based on these symptoms and physical examination findings, the most likely diagnosis is post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis (PSGN). PSGN is an autoimmune disorder that occurs as a complication of streptococcal pharyngitis or skin infection. The kidney biopsy finding of effacement of podocytes on electron microscopy supports this diagnosis. Therefore, the urinalysis findings would likely include those consistent with PSGN, such as granular casts and tubular epithelial cells.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
