["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The problem is describing an occlusion that has caused a 50% reduction in the diameter of the left circumflex artery. This means the resistance to blood flow in this vessel has increased due to the narrowing. The increase in resistance can be calculated using the formula: R_new = R_original * (1 / (1 - (diameter_reduction/diameter-original))), where R_new is the new resistance, R_original is the original resistance, and diameter-reduction is the percentage reduction in diameter. Given that there's a 50% reduction in diameter, we can plug in these values to find the increase in resistance.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
