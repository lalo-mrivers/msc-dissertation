["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with generalized pruritus and raised erythematous plaques on the skin, which suggests an allergic reaction. The sudden onset of symptoms after eating at a seafood restaurant makes food allergy a possible culprit. The patient's past history of narrow-angle glaucoma is not relevant to this presentation. The nasal exam shows clear secretions with edematous and erythematous mucosa, suggesting an allergic rhinitis. Diphenhydramine is an antihistamine that can help alleviate pruritus and other symptoms of allergic reactions. Fexofenadine is also an antihistamine, but it's more specific for allergic rhinitis. Vitamin K has no relation to this presentation, and calamine lotion is a topical treatment for skin conditions like eczema or poison ivy, which doesn't fit here.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
