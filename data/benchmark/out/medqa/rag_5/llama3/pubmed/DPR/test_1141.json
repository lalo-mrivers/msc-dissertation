["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's history of regular menstrual cycles with normal duration suggests that her ovaries are functioning normally. The husband's semen analysis also shows normal sperm counts and morphology. The patient has been trying to conceive for over a year, which is not an unusually long time. However, the recent failed attempt at in vitro fertilization (IVF) might suggest that there is an issue with ovulation or implantation. Given these facts, we can rule out pelvic inflammatory disease as it would likely affect menstrual cycles and cause abnormal bleeding. Diminished ovarian reserve could be a possibility, but it's not the most likely cause given the patient's normal menstrual cycles. Premature ovarian failure is also unlikely due to the patient's young age and regular menstrual cycles. Therefore, we are left with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism as the most possible cause.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
