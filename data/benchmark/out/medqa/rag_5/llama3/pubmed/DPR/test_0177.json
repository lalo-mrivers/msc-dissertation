["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 55-year-old man with a history of professional athletics. He has bilateral wrist and knee pain that has been present for the last 10 years, morning stiffness lasting around 50 minutes, and tenderness in the base of both thumbs. The most distinctive feature is the presence of non-tender nodules on the left distal interphalangeal joints. This suggests an inflammatory arthritis rather than degenerative osteoarthritis or a crystal-induced condition like gout. Ankylosing spondylitis is also possible, but the bilateral wrist and knee involvement make it less likely. Fibromyalgia does not typically present with nodules or crepitus on joint examination.\n\nThe patient's history of professional athletics at an older age (50) suggests that he may have developed some sort of overuse-related condition. The nodules are characteristic of psoriatic arthritis, which is often associated with a history of athletic activity and can cause bilateral wrist and knee pain. Additionally, the morning stiffness and tenderness in the base of both thumbs are also consistent with this diagnosis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
