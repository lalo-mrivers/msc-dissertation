["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 3-year-old boy with difficulty understanding his speech and following instructions. He has a history of recurrent ear infections treated with antibiotics since birth. Otoscopic examination shows retracted tympanic membranes bilaterally that are immobile on pneumatic otoscopy, indicating middle ear effusion. Nasopharyngoscopy shows mild adenoid hypertrophy. Pure tone audiometry shows conductive hearing loss on both sides. Based on these findings, the most likely cause of his speech difficulty is middle ear effusion rather than an underlying neurological or developmental disorder.\n\nA tympanostomy tube insertion would be the most appropriate next step in management to drain the middle ear fluid and relieve the conductive hearing loss.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
