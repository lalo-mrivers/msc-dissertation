["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Miglitol is an alpha-glucosidase inhibitor. It inhibits the enzyme that breaks down carbohydrates into simple sugars. Phosphodiester bonds are not related to carbohydrate metabolism. Glycosidic bonds are broken down by alpha-glucosidases, which miglitol inhibits. Cystine bonds are a type of disulfide bond and are not related to carbohydrate metabolism. Hydrogen bonds are general chemical interactions and are not specific to carbohydrate metabolism. Therefore, the answer is B: Glycosidic bonds.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
