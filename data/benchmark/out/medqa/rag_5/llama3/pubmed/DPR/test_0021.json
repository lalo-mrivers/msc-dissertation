["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 3-month-old infant with symptoms of coughing, difficulty breathing while feeding, fatigue, and listlessness. The physical exam reveals a high-pitched holosystolic murmur at the lower left sternal border. Considering the patient's history and physical findings, I think step by step about possible causes. Since there is no prior medical history in the mother, I eliminate any maternal factors such as alcohol consumption or lithium exposure. The patient's normal APGAR score at birth suggests that there are no significant congenital abnormalities. The high-pitched murmur at the lower left sternal border makes me think of a cardiac abnormality. Cardiac lesions can cause symptoms like those described, especially if they result in cyanosis (which is not reported here). 22q11 deletion and deletion of genes on chromosome 7 are known to cause certain cardiac anomalies, such as tetralogy of Fallot and atrioventricular canal defects, which can lead to cardiac murmurs. Therefore, the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms is an underlying cardiac abnormality.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A: 22q11 deletion\""]
