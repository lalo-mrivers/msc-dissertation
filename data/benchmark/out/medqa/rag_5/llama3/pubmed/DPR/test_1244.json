["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking why the patient should not be switched to exenatide. The relevant information provided is that the patient has type 1 diabetes mellitus, poor adherence to his current insulin regimen, and difficulty putting on weight despite eating copiously. Type 1 diabetes mellitus means that the pancreas does not produce sufficient insulin, which makes option A less likely as a reason why exenatide should not be used. Option B is also unlikely because exenatide suppresses glucagon secretion, which would actually decrease the risk of hypoglycemia. Option D is incorrect because there is no age restriction for using exenatide in children with type 1 diabetes mellitus. Therefore, option C must be the correct answer. Suppression of appetite by exenatide would make it even harder for the patient to gain weight.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"]
