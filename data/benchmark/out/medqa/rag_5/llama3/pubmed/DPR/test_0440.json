["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 12-year-old boy presenting with persistent bleeding from one nostril. The bleeding started spontaneously, and there is no history of abnormal bleeding in the family or medications taken. On examination, the bleeding is localized to the left nostril, which suggests a possible anatomical issue. The patient's vital signs are within normal limits, and the rest of the physical examination shows no abnormalities.\n\nThe most likely cause of this bleeding is epistaxis, which is a common condition in children. Epistaxis is caused by a rupture of one or more blood vessels in the nasal passages. In children, epistaxis is usually due to a anatomical issue such as enlarged turbinates or a deviated septum.\n\nThe most appropriate initial therapy for this patient would be to apply pressure to the bleeding nostril with a gauze or petroleum-based product to stop the bleeding. Oxymetazoline nasal spray should not be used as it may cause rebound congestion and worsen the bleeding. Anterior packing and topical antibiotics are also not necessary in this case as the bleeding is self-limited. Squeezing the nostrils manually for 10 minutes with the head elevated may help to stop the bleeding, but it is not the most effective method.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate initial therapy would be D: Squeezing the nostrils manually for 10 minutes with the head elevated.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
