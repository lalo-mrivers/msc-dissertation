["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about reducing the risk of postoperative hyperalgesia in a chronic opioid abuser. Opioid tolerance can lead to hyperalgesia due to changes in the endogenous opioid system. One key mechanism underlying this phenomenon is the activation of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors.
