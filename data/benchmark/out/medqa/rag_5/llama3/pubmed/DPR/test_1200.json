["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with a 3-day history of fever, chills, and generalized weakness. He has a history of neck abscess, smoking, and IV drug use. His laboratory studies show anemia, leukocytosis, thrombocytosis, and mild liver enzyme elevation. The transthoracic echocardiography reveals multiple vegetations on the tricuspid valve with moderate tricuspid regurgitation. This suggests endocarditis.
