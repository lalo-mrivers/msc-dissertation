["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is given prophylactic labetalol and magnesium sulfate. Examination shows absent deep tendon reflexes bilaterally. This suggests that the patient may have a case of eclampsia or preeclampsia, which are both hypertensive disorders during pregnancy. The use of magnesium sulfate as a treatment option for these conditions is well established. However, the use of labetalol is less clear-cut in this scenario. Labetalol is typically used to manage hypertension, but it may also affect reflexes by blocking alpha-adrenergic receptors. Therefore, the absent deep tendon reflexes are likely related to the magnesium sulfate treatment. Given this information, the most appropriate next step would be to stop the magnesium sulfate and give calcium gluconate.\",\n\"answer_choice\": A"]
