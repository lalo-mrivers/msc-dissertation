["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presented with flu-like symptoms followed by acute agitation, photophobia, and dysphagia. He had recently returned from Mexico where he went spelunking. This suggests a viral infection. The autopsy showed a viral infection in the brain tissue. Considering the route of spread to the CNS, hematogenous dissemination to the meninges is unlikely as it would not cause specific symptoms like photophobia and dysphagia. Retrograde migration up peripheral nerve axons is also unlikely as it would not explain the onset of flu-like symptoms. Reactivation of virus previously latent in dorsal root ganglia is a possibility as it can cause meningitis-like symptoms. Infection of oligodendrocytes and astrocytes is less likely to cause specific symptoms like photophobia and dysphagia. Therefore, C: Reactivation of virus previously latent in dorsal root ganglia is the most plausible explanation.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
