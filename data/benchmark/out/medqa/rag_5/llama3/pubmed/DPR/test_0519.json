["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is experiencing a gunshot wound with multiple abrasions on the arms and thorax. He has a penetrating injury to the right side of the chest in the 6th intercostal space at the midclavicular line, with minimal bleeding. The abdominal examination shows diffuse mild tenderness to palpation without guarding or rebound. A focused assessment with sonography shows no obvious free fluid in the pericardium, and the chest X-ray shows mild opacification of the right lower lobe. Given these findings, it is likely that the patient has a penetrating thoracic injury, which may be causing his hypotension (blood pressure 79/42 mm Hg). The most appropriate next step in management would be to investigate the extent of the chest injury.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
