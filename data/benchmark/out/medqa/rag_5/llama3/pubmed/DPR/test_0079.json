["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has a penetrating wound to the chest, which is bleeding profusely. The vital signs indicate shock with hypotension, tachycardia, and tachypnea. The transthoracic echocardiography reveals a full thickness penetrating injury to the right ventricular free wall. There are no apparent injuries to any coronary arteries or major branches. Therefore, the priority is to control bleeding and stabilize the patient. Immediate cardiac transplant is not necessary as there is no indication of cardiac failure. Watchful waiting while resuscitative fluids are initiated may not be sufficient to control bleeding and stabilize the patient. Interrupted 2-0 polypropylene suture with supporting pledgets is a possible option to repair the wound, but it requires surgical expertise and equipment. Needle thoracostomy over the 2nd intercostal space is not a suitable option as it may not address the root cause of bleeding and may even worsen the situation.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
