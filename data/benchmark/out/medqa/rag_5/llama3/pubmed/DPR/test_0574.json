["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with pitting edema and proteinuria exceeding 3.5g in 24 hours, suggesting a possible glomerular disease. Given the loss of polyanions in the glomerular basement membranes as mentioned in the question, I will consider diseases that affect the glomeruli. Pregnancy toxemia is ruled out since it is a pregnancy-related condition and not relevant to an 11-year-old boy. Migraine or Reiter's syndrome do not seem related to this patient's symptoms either. The presence of pitting edema and proteinuria points towards a possible nephrotic syndrome. In that case, I will consider the findings associated with minimal change disease, which is characterized by loss of polyanions in the glomerular basement membranes.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
