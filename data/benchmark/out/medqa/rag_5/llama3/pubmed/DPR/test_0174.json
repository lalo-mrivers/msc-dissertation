["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The study is investigating the effect of earlier detection of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) on survival time. The endpoint selected is average survival time. A comparison is made between patients who were diagnosed with GBM after a screening MRI and those who were diagnosed only after they developed symptoms. This suggests that the difference in survival time may be due to the fact that patients were diagnosed earlier, not because of any inherent difference in their disease progression or treatment.\", \"answer_choice\": D}"]
