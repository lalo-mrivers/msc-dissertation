["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question describes a patient with rhinoplasty 3 months prior who is now presenting with a whistling noise when breathing through her nose. The physical exam confirms the phenomenon. Considering the timeline of the procedure and the symptoms, we can rule out post-operative swelling as it would have resolved by this point. A septal hematoma causing a perforation is also unlikely given the patient's good recovery overall. Excessive columellar show could potentially cause altered nasal airflow, but it seems less likely to cause a whistling noise specifically. Therefore, the most plausible explanation is that the deviated septum was corrected during the rhinoplasty procedure, and now the air flowing through her nose creates the whistling sound due to the altered airflow.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
