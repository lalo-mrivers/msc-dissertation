["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The test is positive for the patients with PD. The total number of patients with PD is 600. Out of these, 590 are true positives (scan positive) and 10 are false negatives (scan negative). The number of patients without PD is also 600, out of which 20 gave a false positive result. To find the specificity, we need to divide the number of true negatives by the total number of patients without PD. Since there's no information about the true negatives, we can't calculate it directly. However, we know that the false positives are 20 and the total number of patients without PD is 600.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
