["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is presenting with regurgitation of breastmilk after feeds, which the mother has tried limiting feed volume to reduce frequency. The patient's height and weight are normal for age, but there is a slight decline in percentiles over time. There is no diarrhea, hematochezia or family history of food allergies. The physical exam shows no signs of distress or organomegaly.
