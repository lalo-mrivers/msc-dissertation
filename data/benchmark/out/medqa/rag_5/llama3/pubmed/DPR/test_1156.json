["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 7-month-old boy with a history of fatigue, weakness, and difficulty feeding. He has a unique physical examination, including tongue protrusion beyond the teeth, distended neck veins, crackles at both lung bases, and cardiomegaly on chest x-ray. The serum glucose level is normal. Based on these findings, I am going to think about possible underlying conditions that could cause this presentation. One possibility is a metabolic disorder, which would explain the patient's fatigue, weakness, and difficulty feeding. Another possibility is an enzyme deficiency, given the patient's muscle weakness and cardiomegaly. Given the age of the patient and the clinical presentation, I am going to focus on possible genetic disorders that could cause these findings.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C: Lysosomal acid maltase\""]
