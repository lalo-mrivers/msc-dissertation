["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided, we know that the patient has a mild normocytic anemia with associated reticulocytosis. This suggests that the anemia is likely caused by hemolysis. The increased RDW and indirect hyperbilirubinemia further support this diagnosis. An osmotic fragility test shows increased fragility in hypotonic solution, which is consistent with hereditary spherocytosis. Therefore, we would expect to see spherocytes on a blood smear.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"]
