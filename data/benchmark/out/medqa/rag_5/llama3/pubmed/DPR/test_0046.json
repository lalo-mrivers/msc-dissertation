["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To calculate the number needed to treat (NNT), we need to find the difference in event rates between the two treatment arms. The primary endpoint is death from cardiac causes, with 134 events in the medication 1 arm and 210 events in the medication 2 arm. We can use the following formula: NNT = (event rate of medication 2 - event rate of medication 1) / absolute risk reduction (ARR). Since we don't have the overall number of patients at risk, we need to calculate the ARR first. To do this, we'll divide the difference in event rates by the event rate of medication 2: ARR = (210-134)/210 = 0.0769 or 7.69%. Then, we can plug in the values: NNT = (210 - 134) / 0.0769 â‰ˆ 16.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B: 16\""]
