["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms are likely related to a metabolic disorder. The musty odor and poor eye contact suggest a possible phenylketonuria (PKU) diagnosis. PKU is a genetic disorder that affects the breakdown of the amino acid phenylalanine, leading to an accumulation of toxic levels.
