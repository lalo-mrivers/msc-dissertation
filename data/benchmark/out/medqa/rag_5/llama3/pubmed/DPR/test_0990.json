["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 3-week-old newborn with poor feeding, irritability, frequent vomiting, and abnormal bowel movements. The vomitus is greenish in color and smells strange. He has small, low-set ears, broad and flat nasal bridge, and large space between the first and second toes bilaterally. The abdomen is distended, and an x-ray of the abdomen shows a section of dilated colon followed by a segment of colon without stool or air. Based on these findings, I suspect that the patient has Hirschsprung's disease. To confirm this diagnosis, I would recommend a rectal suction biopsy.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
