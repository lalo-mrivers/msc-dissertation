["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has a defect in the membranous portion of the interventricular septum and a moderately decreased left ventricular ejection fraction. This information suggests that the patient has a congenital heart defect. The symptoms of sweating and respiratory distress while eating are consistent with cyanosis, which is often seen in patients with cyanotic heart defects. Considering these findings, it's likely that the patient has a ventricular septal defect (VSD). VSDs typically produce a systolic murmur that increases with inspiration, which is not one of the answer choices. However, VSDs can also produce a systolic murmur that decreases or remains unchanged during inspiration, which is consistent with option A.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
