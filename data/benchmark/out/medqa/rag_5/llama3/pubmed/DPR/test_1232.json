["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"A type I error occurs when a true null hypothesis is rejected. In this case, the authors found significant reductions in asthma exacerbations and improvements in markers of asthma control with mepolizumab treatment.

Therefore, if the authors had inadvertently encountered a type I error, it would mean that they incorrectly rejected the null hypothesis, implying that the observed effects are due to chance rather than the actual treatment.\",\n\"answer_choice\": A"]
