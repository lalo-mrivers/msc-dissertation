["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has a cadaveric renal transplant and is experiencing pain in the right lower abdomen, decreased urinary output, and increasing creatinine levels. He also has tubulitis on biopsy of the transplanted kidney, which suggests an immune-mediated rejection. C4d staining is negative, which rules out antibody-mediated rejection. Given the patient's history of adult polycystic kidney disease and current medications, it seems less likely that the findings are due to drug-induced nephrotoxicity or fibrosis of the glomerular vessels. Newly formed anti-HLA antibodies could be a possibility, but given the patient's immune status after transplantation, it is more plausible that recipient T-cells in the graft are responsible for the findings.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
