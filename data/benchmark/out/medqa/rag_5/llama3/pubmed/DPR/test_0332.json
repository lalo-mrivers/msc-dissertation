["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has been taking digoxin for 1 year with normal lab results. The electrocardiogram shows paroxysmal atrial tachycardia with block, which is a typical finding in digitalis toxicity. The serum digoxin level is higher than the therapeutic range. Considering these findings, it's likely that the patient has developed digitalis toxicity. Digoxin can cause hypokalemia as a side effect. However, since the patient was taking verapamil, a potassium-channel blocker, which can exacerbate hypokalemia, this mechanism is less likely. The other options are not directly related to digoxin's toxic effects.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
