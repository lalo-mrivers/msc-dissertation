["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the developmental stage of a T cell when it undergoes positive selection. Positive selection ensures the preservation of self-MHC-restricted T cells. The process takes place during the maturation of T lymphocytes in the thymus. According to the text, a T cell passes through several stages during its maturation. These stages include pre-T cell, double-positive T cell, single-positive CD4+ T cell, and single-positive CD8+ T cell. Based on this information, positive selection must occur before the T cell becomes a single-positive cell.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
