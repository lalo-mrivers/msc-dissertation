["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is in active labor with a history of gestational diabetes. She has severe pelvic pain which improves after epidural anesthesia is performed. Ten minutes later, she develops dizziness and hypotension (blood pressure 90/60 mm Hg). This suggests that the hypotension may be related to the epidural anesthesia. The patient does not have any other obvious signs of shock or hypovolemia. Acute pulmonary hypertension is unlikely given the patient's vital signs are stable before the onset of hypotension. Aortocaval compression is a possibility but it would likely cause more significant changes in the patient's vital signs.\n\nThe most likely underlying cause of the patient's hypotension is probably sympathetic block caused by the epidural anesthesia. This can cause a loss of vasomotor tone and hypotension, especially if the anesthetic spread to the thoracic level.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
