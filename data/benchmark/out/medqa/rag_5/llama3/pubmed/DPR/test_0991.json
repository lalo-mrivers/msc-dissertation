["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 13-year-old boy with progressive left leg pain for 2 months. He was hit by a baseball one week before the pain started, which caused his leg to become red and swollen. Laboratory studies show a leukocyte count of 21,000/mm3 and an ESR of 68 mm/h. An x-ray of the left lower extremity shows multiple lytic lesions in the middle third of the femur. A biopsy of the left femur shows small round blue cells. The patient's symptoms do not match osteochondroma or osteoid osteoma, which are typically benign and solitary lesions. Ewing sarcoma is a possibility, but the age range for this disease is typically 5-15 years old, which matches the patient's age. Osteosarcoma is also a possibility due to the presence of multiple lytic lesions and the patient's age.\",\n\"answer_choice\": A"]
