["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with a pink bump on his forehead that has rapidly developed over the last month. He has had significant sun exposure in the past. The physical examination reveals a 2 cm dome-shaped plaque with a central keratin plug. The biopsy shows an exophytic nodule with central invagination, full of keratin. Keratinocyte atypia is minimal.\n\nGiven these findings, it's likely that the lesion is related to sun exposure. Seborrheic keratosis and Kaposi's sarcoma are not typically associated with rapid growth or sun exposure. Basal cell carcinoma can be caused by sun exposure, but it usually does not have a central keratin plug.\n\nThe most likely diagnosis based on these findings is therefore Keratoacanthoma.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
