["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The researcher wants to detect HIF-1a in RCC under normoxic conditions using blotting techniques. Since HIF-1a is targeted for proteasomal degradation by VHL protein under normoxia, it will not be detected if the cells are normoxic. The only way to detect HIF-1a under normoxic conditions would be if the cells are not allowing VHL to hydroxylate prolyl residues on HIF-1a, which could occur if they have a VHL mutation or are mimicking hypoxia.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: A Western blot will show increased HIF-1Î± compared to a normoxic control.\""]
