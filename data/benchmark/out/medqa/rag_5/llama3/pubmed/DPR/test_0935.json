["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about a patient with an absolute increase in certain blood cells. The patient has no specific complaints and the physical examination is normal. From this information, it can be inferred that the increased cell count is likely benign. The next step would be to look at the image provided, which shows an increase in eosinophils. Eosinophils are a type of white blood cell. They play a role in allergic reactions and parasite infections. In normal conditions, they make up around 1-4% of the total leucocyte count. Since the patient has no complaints and the physical examination is normal, it can be concluded that the increased eosinophil count is likely related to an underlying condition rather than a disease.\n\nThe options provide more information about these cells. Option A suggests that these cells transform into macrophages when they migrate to peripheral tissues. However, this does not seem relevant to the patient's presentation.\n\nOption B mentions CD25 expression on the surface of these cells. This is not a characteristic commonly associated with eosinophils.\n\nOption C claims that these cells normally constitute 25-40% of total leucocyte count, which is higher than their actual proportion in normal conditions.\n\nOption D suggests that these cells have lymphoid origin. While this is true for some types of white blood cells, it does not seem relevant to the patient's presentation or the information provided about the increased cell count.\n\nBased on the available information and options, option C appears to be the most likely correct answer.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
