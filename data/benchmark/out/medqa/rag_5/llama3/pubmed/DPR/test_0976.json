["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is 25 years old with a history of two normal vaginal deliveries. She has a positive urine pregnancy test result and desires an elective abortion after one week of pregnancy. Considering the gestational age (4 weeks) and the patient's desire for a quick procedure, I would rule out oral mifepristone + misoprostol as it is typically used for medical abortions up to 9 weeks of gestation. Manual uterine aspiration might be an option, but considering the gestational age, I would choose dilation and evacuation (D&E) as the most appropriate procedure for elective termination of pregnancy in this patient.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
