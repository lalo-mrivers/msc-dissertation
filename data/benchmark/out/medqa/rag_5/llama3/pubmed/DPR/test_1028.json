["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with a painless swelling over his right leg, which is well-circumscribed and non-tender. The pathologist reports the tumor to be a liposarcoma rather than a lipoma. Liposarcomas are malignant neoplasms of adipose tissue origin. They can exhibit increased activity of various enzymes compared to benign lipomas.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe relevant documents do not contain information on specific enzymes associated with liposarcomas or lipomas. However, the document [Spontaneous subcapsular hematoma of the kidney] is about a different type of tumor and does not provide any relevant information for this question.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn general, malignant tumors can exhibit increased activity of certain enzymes, such as telomerase, which is known to be activated in many types of cancer. However, the other options (alkaline phosphatase, RNase, superoxide dismutase) are not directly related to liposarcomas.\\r\\n\\r\\nBased on the information provided and considering that the tumor is a liposarcoma, it is most likely that telomerase will show increased activity in the cells of this patient's tumor.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
