["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the embryological structure that gives rise to the primitive blastemal cells, immature tubules and glomeruli found in the kidney mass. The options provided are all related to endocrine glands or cardiac structures, but none of them seem directly relevant to the kidney. Therefore, we need to think about what other structures develop from the same embryological origin as the kidneys. One possibility is that the kidneys share a common origin with the adrenal glands. This is because both the kidneys and the adrenal glands arise from the mesonephros during embryonic development. Therefore, it seems likely that the primitive blastemal cells, immature tubules and glomeruli found in the kidney mass are derived from the same embryological structure as the adrenal medulla.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
