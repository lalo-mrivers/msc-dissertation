["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To calculate the number needed to treat (NNT) for the new drug, we need to find the difference in cure rates between the study treatment group and the control group. The cure rate in the study treatment group is 190/250 = 0.76 or 76%. In the control group, it's 165/250 = 0.66 or 66%. The absolute risk reduction (ARR) is therefore 0.76 - 0.66 = 0.1 or 10%. Since we want to know how many patients need to be treated with the new drug to prevent one additional case of tinea versicolor, we're looking for NNT, which is equal to 1/ARR. Therefore, NNT = 1/0.1 = 10.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: 355/500\""]
