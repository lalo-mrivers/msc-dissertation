["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is infected with a virus that has a helical capsid and a segmented genome. The son is free of symptoms despite living with the infected woman and having family members who have had similar symptoms. This suggests that the virus may not be highly contagious or may require specific conditions to transmit.\n\nThe polymerase chain reaction test confirms the infection, which eliminates other potential causes. Considering the viral characteristics and the epidemiological context, it is unlikely that the son's lack of symptoms is due to the presence of serum antibodies against hemagglutinin (A), as this would imply a previous exposure or immunity.\n\nDownregulation of ICAM-1 expression (B) is also an unlikely explanation, as this refers to the regulation of cell adhesion molecules, which does not directly relate to viral transmission.\n\nProtease-resistant antibodies in nasal secretions (C) are not mentioned in any relevant context, and their role in transmitting or preventing infection is unclear.\n\nHomozygous mutation in the CCR5 gene (D) could potentially provide resistance to infection, but this would be an unusual occurrence, especially given the family members' symptoms. This option seems less plausible than the others.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
