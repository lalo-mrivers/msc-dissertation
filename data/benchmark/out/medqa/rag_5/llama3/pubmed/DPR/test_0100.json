["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's laboratory studies show a high reticulocyte count (9%) and a low direct bilirubin level (0.3 mg/dL), suggesting hemolytic disease of the newborn. The mother is Rh-negative, but has an anti-Rh antibody titer positive, indicating that she has already been exposed to Rh-positive blood. This exposure likely occurred during delivery, as she did not receive prenatal care and therefore was not aware of her pregnancy or at risk for Rh sensitization until then. As a result, the fetus is also Rh-negative. The combination of maternal anti-Rh antibodies and fetal Rh-negativity suggests that this patient's condition is most likely caused by hemolytic disease of the newborn due to ABO incompatibility.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
