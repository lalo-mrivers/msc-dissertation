["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the function of different enzymes in various human cell types. The subset of normal human cells harvested and isolated has an elevated intracellular concentration of bisphosphoglycerate mutase. This suggests that these cells are likely to be involved in glycolysis, as bisphosphoglycerate mutase is an enzyme involved in the conversion of 3-phosphoglycerate to 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate. Looking at the options, we can see that pyruvate kinase is also an enzyme involved in glycolysis, specifically in the conversion of phosphoenolpyruvate to pyruvate. Therefore, it is most likely that pyruvate kinase would be present in these cells.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
