["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has a history of shortness of breath and weight loss. He is an active smoker with a 36-pack-year smoking history. The blood work shows mild obstruction on pulmonary function test (PFT) with FEV1/FVC ratio of 60% and FEV1 of 50% of predicted value, indicating obstructive lung disease. His lung volumes show a total lung capacity of 110% and residual volume of 115% of predicted value, suggesting hyperinflation. The DLCO is 60% of predicted value, which could be due to smoking or other causes. Considering his history and PFT results, the most likely diagnosis is chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) caused by smoking.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
