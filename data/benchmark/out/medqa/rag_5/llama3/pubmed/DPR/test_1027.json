["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, we need to find the volume of heparin needed. Since the volume of distribution is 60 mL/kg and the patient weighs 50 kg, we multiply these two values: 60 mL/kg * 50 kg = 3,000 mL. Then, we divide this value by the desired peak plasma concentration (0.5 units/mL) to find the loading dose: 3,000 mL / 0.5 units/mL = 6,000 units.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C\n}"]
