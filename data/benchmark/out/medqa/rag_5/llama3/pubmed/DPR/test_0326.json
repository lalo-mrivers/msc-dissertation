["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 39-year-old African-American woman with a past medical history of sarcoidosis. She presents with hip pain, which started 2 weeks ago and has been getting progressively more intense. Considering her recent diagnosis of sarcoidosis, the most likely cause of her symptoms is an opportunistic infection, specifically osteitis or septic arthritis. Radiographs of the hip may be helpful in detecting any bone destruction or joint space narrowing, but they would not be sensitive enough to detect early signs of osteitis or septic arthritis. MRI and radionuclide scan could be useful in detecting inflammatory changes or abscesses, respectively. However, ultrasound is unlikely to be a reliable method for detecting these conditions.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
