["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient developed respiratory distress with crackles present bilaterally on physical examination. He did not respond to mechanical ventilation and 100% oxygen. The autopsy revealed heavy, red lungs with histology shown in Image A. This suggests a severe pulmonary disease that is likely related to the patient's lung findings. Given the acute onset of symptoms and the fact that the patient did not improve despite respiratory support, I think it's unlikely that this was due to diaphragmatic hypertrophy or interstitial edema. The presence of a large pulmonary embolus could have caused respiratory insufficiency, but the histology would likely show other findings as well. Based on the description of the lungs and lack of improvement with therapy, I think the most likely diagnosis is\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
