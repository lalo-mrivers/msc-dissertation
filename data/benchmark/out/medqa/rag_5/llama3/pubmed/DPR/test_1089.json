["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with right-sided facial swelling that has worsened over the last month. He returned from a trip to India recently, which suggests an infectious etiology. The absence of pain and erythema/lymphadenopathy makes infection less likely. The neurological exam reveals no deficits. The patient is up to date on immunizations. Given the location-specific exposure during travel, I consider environmental or systemic factors that could be contributing to the facial swelling. Spontaneous subcapsular hematoma of the kidney was reported previously, but it does not seem related to this patient's symptoms. Pregnancy toxemia and renal cell carcinoma are also unlikely given the patient's age and lack of other symptoms. Reiter's syndrome is a possibility considering the patient's travel history, but I do not have information on a possible relation between Reiter's syndrome and facial swelling. The remaining options are tumors, which could be benign or malignant. The absence of pain suggests a non-inflammatory process.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
