["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has no abnormal moles or warts on her skin examination. She is concerned about cancer because her uncle died of metastatic melanoma 1 year ago. This suggests that she may be at risk for developing melanoma due to a family history. Her occupation and travel habits do not seem relevant to the development of melanoma. The question asks about the type of melanoma, so we should focus on the characteristics that increase the risk of developing melanoma. A family history is a known risk factor for melanoma. The patient's age also increases her risk. The absence of abnormal moles or warts suggests that she may be more likely to develop nodular or acral lentiginous melanoma, as these types are less associated with characteristic skin lesions.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
