["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with a sudden onset of symptoms after taking foreign-manufactured fat-burning pills. The symptoms include fever, chest discomfort, tachypnea, pain, needle-like sensations in the upper extremities, and profuse sweating. Additionally, he has a gradual decrease in vision over the past 3 months and bilateral cataracts on ophthalmologic examination. His physical examination reveals a reddish maculopapular rash, diminished lung and heart sounds, tenderness to palpation in his abdomen, and rotational bilateral nystagmus with an alternating gaze-dependent fast component.\n\nThe patient's laboratory results show an increased total leukocyte count (3750/mm3) and neutrophils (57%).

Uncoupling of the electron transport chain and oxidative phosphorylation is a possible mechanism for this reaction.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
