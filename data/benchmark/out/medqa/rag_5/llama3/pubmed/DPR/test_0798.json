["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is presenting with a uterine size greater than expected for her gestational age, taut and shiny skin with scattered striae on her abdomen, and ultrasound findings of excessive amniotic fluid. These symptoms are consistent with polyhydramnios. Polyhydramnios can be caused by various fetal abnormalities or dysfunctions, such as renal agenesis, pulmonary hypoplasia, duodenal atresia, or posterior urethral valve. The patient is 22 weeks gestation and has a normal ultrasound of the fetus except for the excessive amniotic fluid, which makes it unlikely that the excess fluid is caused by a large fetus due to an abnormality such as pulmonary hypoplasia or duodenal atresia. Renal agenesis could potentially cause polyhydramnios through the inability of the kidneys to concentrate urine, leading to increased amniotic fluid production. Posterior urethral valve is also a possible cause of polyhydramnios due to urinary tract obstruction.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
