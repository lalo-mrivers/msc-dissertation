["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking which statement from the patient is consistent with the impression that the patient is exhibiting the defense mechanism of suppression. Suppression is a coping mechanism where an individual pushes unpleasant thoughts or emotions out of their conscious awareness. In this case, the patient's statements will reveal avoidance or denial of the colon cancer experience.\n\nOptions A and B seem to be inconsistent with suppression as they indicate the patient is actively thinking about and engaging with their experience (helping other patients, feeling grateful).\n\nOption C doesn't seem to directly relate to the defense mechanism being asked about, so it might not be the best fit either.\n\nThis leaves Option D, which suggests the patient has been avoiding or pushing away thoughts about the colonoscopy until now. This aligns with the concept of suppression as a coping mechanism to avoid unpleasant emotions.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
