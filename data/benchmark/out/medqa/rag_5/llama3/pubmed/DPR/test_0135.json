["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The researcher isolated a group of cells positive for CD8 and mixed them with infected cells. The crosslinking of extracellular interactions suggests that the protein may be involved in cell-cell interaction or adhesion. Additionally, immunoprecipitation of CD8 suggests that the protein is bound to CD8. Since the protein is composed of two chains from an adjacent cell, it likely plays a role in cell-cell interaction rather than peptide presentation.\n\nThe only choice that fits this description is C: Binds exogenous peptides that have been transported by the TAP channel. This does not make sense in the context of the experiment. A more plausible explanation is that the protein is involved in cell-cell adhesion, possibly through the classical pathway of complement activation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
