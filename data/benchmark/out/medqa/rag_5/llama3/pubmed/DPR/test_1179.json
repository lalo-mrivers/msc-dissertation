["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with weakness in upper extremities (1/5) and reduced sensation. The lower extremities show normal strength and sensation. This suggests a central nervous system (CNS) or spinal cord involvement. Given the patient's past history of asthma, depression, and anxiety, a psychological component cannot be ruled out.
