["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient had an acute drop in blood pressure during surgery with ST elevations noted in multiple leads. He experienced an oxygen desaturation of 85% despite being on a respirator with 100% oxygen at 15 breaths/minute, and auscultation showed air entry bilaterally with crackles. A Swan-Ganz catheter reading displayed CVP: 4 mmHg, RVP: 20/5 mmHg, PAP: 20/5 mmHg, PCWP: 5 mmHg. The patient died soon after this episode.
