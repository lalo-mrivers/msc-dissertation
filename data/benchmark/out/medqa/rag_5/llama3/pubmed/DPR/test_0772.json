["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is presenting with symptoms of perianal itching and excoriations. The scotch tape test is positive indicating a contact dermatitis. Given the patient's allergy to albendazole, we need to find an alternative medication that can be used. After reviewing the documents, I found no information related to this specific condition or medication options. However, one of the documents discusses gallbladder disease and cholecystectomy during pregnancy, which is not relevant to this case. Another document mentions a procedure for laparoscopic cholecystectomy, but it does not provide any information on medications. The fourth document discusses high-performance ion exchange chromatography column matrix, which is also unrelated to the patient's condition. Therefore, I will rely on my general medical knowledge and look for alternative medications that can be used for contact dermatitis. Ivermectin is sometimes used off-label for pruritus and eczema, so it could be a potential alternative medication.\", \"answer_choice\": B}"]
