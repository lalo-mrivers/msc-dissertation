She had a similar condition since childhood, which was previously diagnosed but never followed up on. The symptoms have worsened during her pregnancy. The vital signs are normal, except for the presence of acrocyanosis. The examination reveals a fixed splitting of S2 and a grade 3/6 midsystolic murmur.
