["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with symptoms of heart failure such as breathlessness, fatigue, and cough. The physical examination shows bilateral crackles over the lung bases, mild hepatomegaly, and an elevated serum B-type natriuretic peptide level. The echocardiogram reveals an enlarged left atrium and a reduced ejection fraction. Considering these findings, the patient likely has heart failure. Valsartan is an angiotensin receptor blocker used to treat hypertension and heart failure. To improve cardiac function, sacubitril, also known as LCZ696, is a combination of sacubitril (a NEP inhibitor) and valsartan. Sacubitril enhances the activity of natriuretic peptides, which can help reduce symptoms of heart failure. Given the patient's diagnosis and treatment with valsartan, sacubitril would be a beneficial addition.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
