["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the type of immune cells that prevent the proliferation of abnormal plasma cells. The key phrase here is 'lyse abnormal cells without the need for opsonization, priming, or prior activation'. This suggests that we are looking for a type of immune cell that can recognize and eliminate abnormal cells directly, without needing additional signaling or activation. Based on this information, I think step by step through the options: A refers to macrophages which don't fit the description as they need phagocytosis; B refers to CD4+ T lymphocytes which also require priming and activation; D doesn't even seem relevant. This leaves us with C: Natural killer cells. These cells can recognize and eliminate abnormal cells without prior activation or opsonization, which fits perfectly with the description.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
