["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with recurrent episodes of chest pain that wake her from sleep, both at night and during the day. The pain is not related to any specific activity or event, but does occur randomly. Given this information, it seems unlikely that the pain is related to coronary artery disease or myocardial infarction, as these are typically caused by strenuous physical activity or stress. Additionally, there is no history of smoking or drug use, which further reduces the likelihood of a cardiovascular cause. However, given her age and female gender, hormonal fluctuations could be a potential factor in her symptoms. The patient's consumption of 5 alcoholic drinks per week may also contribute to her symptoms. Based on these factors, it seems possible that the patient's symptoms could be related to angina pectoris or more specifically, coronary vasospasm. This is supported by the fact that she has had no previous episodes and there is no other known cause of her symptoms.\n\nGiven this information, an anti-anginal medication would be a reasonable choice to reduce her symptoms. Aspirin or beta blockers such as propranolol are commonly used for angina pectoris. Isosorbide dinitrate is also a possible option, although it is typically used more specifically for chronic stable angina.\n\nHeparin is not a typical treatment for chest pain and is primarily used to prevent or treat thrombotic episodes such as deep vein thrombosis.\",\n\"answer_choice\": A"]
