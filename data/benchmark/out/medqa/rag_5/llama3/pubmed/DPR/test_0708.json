["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms are consistent with neonatal jaundice. The liver function tests show elevated total bilirubin, unconjugated bilirubin, and normal conjugated bilirubin, which suggests a defect in the conjugation of bilirubin. UDP-glucuronosyltransferase-1A1 is essential for the conjugation of bilirubin. A deficiency or reduction in its activity would lead to unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia, which is consistent with the patient's lab results.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C: Reduction in UDP-glucuronosyltransferase-1A1 activity\""]
