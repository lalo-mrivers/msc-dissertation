["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with an inability to urinate, which is a concerning symptom. The patient also mentions having trouble speaking and changes in vision in the past, but these episodes have resolved.

Therefore, I would order an initial test to assess the brain and nervous system.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
