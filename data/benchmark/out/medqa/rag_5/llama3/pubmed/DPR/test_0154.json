["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 4-year-old boy with a generalized rash for 3 days, accompanied by fever, headache, and muscle pain. He had a runny nose 5 days ago which subsided with over-the-counter medications. He recently returned from a camping trip and attends a daycare center. The examination shows several macules, papules, and crusted lesions over his face, trunk, and extremities, as well as fluid-filled vesicles on his abdomen and back. Given these symptoms and the patient's age, I think it is likely that he has contracted a viral infection. Considering the rash and fever, I rule out Reiter's syndrome and pregnancy toxemia. The patient does not have any recent travel history or contact with someone who has measles or rubella. Therefore, I focus on possible viral infections that could cause such symptoms. Urushiol-induced dermatitis is unlikely as it typically causes a more localized reaction and is caused by exposure to poison ivy. Based on the patient's symptoms and clinical examination, I think the most likely diagnosis is chickenpox.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
