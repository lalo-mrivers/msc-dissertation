["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is complaining of breathlessness with sharp pain on the right side of his chest with each inspiration, which suggests a pulmonary embolism (PE) diagnosis. The patient has been confined to bed for 5 days post knee replacement surgery, which is a high-risk period for PE development. The chest X-ray does not show any significant findings, but the ECG shows sinus tachycardia, which can be indicative of a PE. Given these symptoms and risk factors, further investigation is necessary to confirm or rule out a PE.\n\nConsidering the patient's symptoms, the first step would be to perform a D-dimer test to rule out PE. If the D-dimer test is positive or inconclusive, a ventilation-perfusion scan (C) would be the next step to further evaluate for a PE. The other options do not seem relevant to this patient's symptoms and risk factors.\n\nBased on the provided information, the best course of management at this time would be to perform a ventilation-perfusion scan.\", \"answer_choice\": C}"]
