["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a one-week-old infant with yellow skin (jaundice), crying several times a day, sleeping 7-8 hours at night, and feeding well. The mother reports no complications during delivery. Given these symptoms, the most likely cause of jaundice in this case is physiologic jaundice of newborns. This condition is common in newborns and resolves on its own within one to two weeks without any intervention.\n\nPhenobarbital administration is not indicated as it's typically used for seizure control or neonatal hyperbilirubinemia.\n\nPlasma exchange is not a treatment option for physiologic jaundice of newborns.\n\nSwitching from breast milk to formula may help alleviate symptoms, but it's not the most recommended approach as exclusive breastfeeding provides essential nutrition and benefits for the infant.\n\nTherefore, the best course of action would be to continue normal breast feeding until the physiological jaundice resolves on its own within one to two weeks.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
