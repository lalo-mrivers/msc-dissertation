["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the inheritance pattern of mutations in the CFTR gene. To answer this, we need to consider the context of studying linkage between two loci. LOD score (Logarithm of Odds) is a statistical measure used to determine the probability of linkage between two genetic markers. A LOD score less than 1 suggests no evidence of linkage, while scores above 3 suggest strong evidence of linkage. Since we are looking for 'high probability', we should focus on a score that indicates strong evidence of linkage. Therefore, option C: LOD Score > 3 is the most likely answer.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
