["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The given question is about the lymphatic route of ovarian cancer metastasizing to the brain. Ovarian cancer typically spreads through the lymphatic system. The relevant document for this question is 'Pregnancy toxemia. A multidisciplinary problem' as it discusses the spread of gestational hypertensive disease, which is similar to the process of ovarian cancer metastasis. According to the document, the spread of gestational hypertensive disease occurs mainly through symptomatic treatment without much information on its etiology. However, this does not directly apply to the question about ovarian cancer metastasizing to the brain. Therefore, we need to look at other relevant lymphatic pathways. In the human body, there are two main lymphatic systems: the superficial system and the deep system. The deep system is more important for tumor spread because it has a direct connection to the systemic circulation. The cisterna chyli is the major drainage point of the deep lymphatic system. Therefore, we can deduce that ovarian cancer would most likely follow this pathway to metastasize to the brain.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
