["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 9-year-old boy with multiple petechiae and bruising on his torso and limbs. The physical exam is unremarkable and the complete blood count is normal. However, the coagulation profile reveals an abnormally prolonged prothrombin time (12 seconds) and activated partial thromboplastin time (60 seconds). This suggests a bleeding disorder. Considering the patient's age and the presence of bruising on multiple areas of the body, it is unlikely that the patient has hemophilia A or von Willebrand disease, which are typically seen in older children and adults. Immune thrombocytopenic purpura can cause petechiae and bruising, but it would not explain the prolonged coagulation times. Acute lymphoblastic leukemia can also present with petechiae and bruising, but it would likely be accompanied by other symptoms such as fever, fatigue, or bone pain. Given the abnormal coagulation profile, the most likely diagnosis is a bleeding disorder.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
