["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 15-year-old girl with primary amenorrhea, secondary sexual characteristics including breast development and sparse pubic hair. She has bilateral inguinal masses and a blind-ended vaginal pouch on pelvic examination. The ultrasound does not show any uterus or ovaries. Based on these findings, it seems that the patient likely has Mayer-Rokitansky-KÃ¼ster-Hauser syndrome (MRKH), which is a rare congenital anomaly characterized by absent or incomplete development of the vagina and uterus. There is no indication of any underlying medical condition that would require treatment with prednisolone. Gonadectomy is not typically performed for primary amenorrhea, but rather for certain types of gender dysphoria. Testosterone therapy is also not indicated in this case. Vaginal dilatory therapy may be considered to help the patient achieve sexual satisfaction, but it is not a direct treatment for her underlying condition.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
