["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 2-year-old boy with symptoms of pallor and increasing lethargy for 2 days. He has a history of abdominal pain, vomiting, and bloody diarrhea one week ago, which have since subsided. The patient's father states that they returned early from a 6-week roadtrip in Mexico because of these symptoms. The patient's immunizations are up-to-date. Laboratory studies show anemia (Hemoglobin 8.5 g/dL), increased mean corpuscular volume (94 Î¼m3), and thrombocytopenia (Platelet count 45,000/mm3). A blood smear shows schistocytes. Considering the patient's travel history to Mexico and laboratory findings, the most likely diagnosis is Hemolytic uremic syndrome.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
