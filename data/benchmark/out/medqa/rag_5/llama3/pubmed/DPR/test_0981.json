["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the characteristic of fexofenadine that allows it to be less sedating than diphenhydramine. Fexofenadine is a second-generation antihistamine, which means it selectively binds to histamine H1 receptors without affecting other neurotransmitter systems like alpha-adrenergic or beta-adrenergic receptors. This selectivity reduces its sedative potential compared to first-generation antihistamines like diphenhydramine, which can bind to multiple receptor types, including alpha- and beta-receptors.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
