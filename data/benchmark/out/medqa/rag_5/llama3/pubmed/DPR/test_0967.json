["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, I would focus on ruling out a possible scaphoid fracture. The anatomical snuffbox tenderness and limited range of motion are concerning for a wrist injury. Finkelstein's test is negative, which suggests that the tenderness may not be related to a ligamentous sprain. The X-rays did not show any abnormalities, but this does not rule out a scaphoid fracture, as it is possible for the fracture to be undisplaced or have minimal displacement.\n\nGiven these findings, I would recommend repeating the X-rays in 2 weeks (option C) to monitor for any potential changes or progression of the injury. This approach would allow us to observe for any signs of healing or nonunion, and also help determine whether further management is needed.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
