["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms suggest a neurologic disorder. The mother reported difficulty rolling from his back to his front and sitting unsupported, which could be indicative of muscle weakness or hypotonia. The patient has symmetric flaccid weakness of both upper and lower extremities, which is consistent with a neurologic disorder. A bell-shaped chest suggests the possibility of kyphoscoliosis, but this does not seem directly related to the patient's symptoms.\n\nThe patient's extraocular muscle movements are intact, and his smile is symmetric, suggesting that the facial nerve (CN VII) is functioning normally. This makes anterior horn cell degeneration or axonal demyelination less likely, as these would affect multiple cranial nerves.\n\nGiven the patient's age and symptoms, the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms is a congenital disorder affecting muscle development and function.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
