["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The investigation involves charging Lys-tRNA with valine instead of lysine and inserting it into the cell. The mRNA sequence contains only codons for lysine. This means that the ribosome will be expecting a lysine residue to be incorporated, but it will receive a valine residue instead due to the mischarged tRNA. Therefore, the ribosome may not recognize the difference between lysine and valine and still incorporate the mischarged amino acid into the growing peptide.\", \"answer_choice\": B}"]
