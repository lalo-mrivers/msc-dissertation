Based on the clinical description, it's unlikely that the lesion is related to pregnancy or restrictive dermopathy given the age and sex of the patient. Enamel hypoplasia and healthcare costs are not relevant to this case. Pregnancy toxemia is also not relevant as the patient is male. Acanthosis nigricans is a condition characterized by thickened, darkened skin in certain areas, but it's not typically associated with greasy lesions on the forehead. Erythema nodosum is an inflammatory reaction caused by infections or autoimmune disorders, but it's not typically characterized by brown, greasy lesions.
