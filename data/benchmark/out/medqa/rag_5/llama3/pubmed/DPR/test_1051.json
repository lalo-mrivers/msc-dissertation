["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, we need to calculate the dose required to achieve a plasma concentration of 15 mg/L. We can use the formula: Dose = (Concentration * Volume of Distribution) / (Bioavailability * Half-Life). Plugging in the given values, we get: Dose = (15 mg/L * 14.3 L) / ((0.5) * (2 hours)). This works out to approximately 430 mg. Since this is a maintenance dose, we need to give it every 8 hours. To find the total daily dose, we multiply the maintenance dose by 3 (since there are 3 doses in a day): Total Daily Dose = 430 mg * 3 = 1290 mg.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
