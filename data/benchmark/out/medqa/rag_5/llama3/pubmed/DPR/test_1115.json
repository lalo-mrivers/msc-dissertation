["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 10-year-old African American girl with known sickle cell disease who has developed anemia due to underlying infection. The patient's past medical history is significant for episodes of acute pain crisis and splenectomy 3 years ago. Upon arrival, her vital signs are within normal limits, but she experiences fevers, chills, a burning sensation at the IV site, and sudden hypotension shortly after the transfusion has begun.
