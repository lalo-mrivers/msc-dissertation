["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the effect of drug X on the retinoblastoma (Rb) gene. Drug X activates cyclin-dependent kinase 4, which means it promotes cell cycle progression. The Rb gene is a tumor suppressor that plays a crucial role in regulating cell cycle progression. When the Rb gene is phosphorylated, it allows the transition from G1 to S phase. Since drug X activates cyclin-dependent kinase 4, it will likely lead to the phosphorylation of the Rb gene and the subsequent progression into S phase.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"]
