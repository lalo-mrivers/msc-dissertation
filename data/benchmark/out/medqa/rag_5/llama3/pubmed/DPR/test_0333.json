["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 36-year-old man with acute myeloid leukemia receiving chemotherapy who was involved in a high-speed motor-vehicle collision. He has multiple bruises and lacerations, decreased breath sounds on the right lung base, tenderness to palpation over the left chest wall, and swelling of the right elbow, wrist, knee, and leg. The patient is unresponsive but groans when stimulated.\n\nThe first priority in management is to stabilize the patient's airway, breathing, and circulation (ABC). The patient's decreased breath sounds on the right lung base suggest a possible pneumothorax or hemothorax, which needs to be addressed urgently.\n\nBased on the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, the most appropriate next step in management is to perform an immediate chest X-ray to rule out any life-threatening conditions such as pneumothorax or hemothorax. This should take priority over other potential causes of the patient's condition, including possible spinal cord injury.\n\nThe patient's head and neck symptoms are concerning but can be addressed after the initial stabilization and chest X-ray.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
