["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with yellowing of the eyes (scleral icterus) which is a sign of jaundice. He has recently started intermittent fasting, which may lead to changes in his liver function tests. However, he has previously experienced a similar episode 4 years ago when recovering from an emergency appendectomy. This suggests that the patient's symptoms are related to a underlying liver issue rather than diet or gallbladder problems.\n\nThe patient's sexual activity and binge drinking 2 days ago do not seem to be directly related to his jaundice, but may indicate other health risks.\n\nGiven the patient's history of similar episodes, it is likely that he has an underlying liver condition.

Given the patient's history, a chronic viral infection of the liver (B) is the most plausible explanation for his symptoms.\", \"answer_choice\": B}"]
