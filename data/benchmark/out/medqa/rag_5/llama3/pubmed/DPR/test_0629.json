["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presented with a knee effusion and was unable to stand after a collision during a soccer game. The physical exam showed that the knee could be pushed posteriorly at 90 degrees of flexion but could not be pulled anteriorly in the same position. This suggests an injury to the ligaments, specifically the ones surrounding the knee joint.
