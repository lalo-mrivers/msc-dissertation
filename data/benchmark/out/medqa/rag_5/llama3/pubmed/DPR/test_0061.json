["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient was treated with metronidazole for a vaginal infection. After consuming alcohol at a party, the patient experiences facial flushing, nausea, tachycardia, dyspnea, headache, and abdominal cramps. This suggests that the reaction is likely due to an interaction between the metronidazole and the alcohol. Metronidazole is known to cause disulfiram-like reactions when combined with alcohols. Disulfiram-like reactions are characterized by facial flushing, nausea, tachycardia, dyspnea, headache, and abdominal cramps. This reaction is caused by the accumulation of acetaldehyde in the body, which is a toxic metabolite that is normally broken down by cytochrome P-450 enzymes. Since metronidazole inhibits this enzyme system, the patient's body cannot break down the acetaldehyde as quickly, leading to its accumulation and causing these symptoms.\", \"answer_choice\": A}"]
