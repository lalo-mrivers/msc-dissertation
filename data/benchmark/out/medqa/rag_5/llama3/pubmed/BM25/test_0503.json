["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about a patient who has a Swan-Ganz catheter placed to evaluate his right heart pressures. The pulmonary wedge pressure recorded is 10 mmHg, which means the catheter tip is likely in a large pulmonary artery. According to the relevant documents, it's important to note that normal values for the pressures obtained from the right ventricle are not provided explicitly. However, we can infer that the pressures should be within normal limits since all pressures recorded were found to be normal.\n\nFrom Pitfalls of Swan-Ganz Catheterization, we learn that if the balloon is inflated eccentrically and the catheter tip is not in a large pulmonary artery, it may lead to inaccurate wedge pressure. However, this does not apply to our patient since the pulmonary wedge pressure recorded is 10 mmHg, which suggests the catheter tip is likely in a large pulmonary artery.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the pressures obtained from the right ventricle should be within normal limits based on the recording of a pulmonary wedge pressure of 10 mmHg.\", \"answer_choice\": C}"]
