["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's presentation suggests a massive pulmonary embolism during the surgery. The ST elevations noted during the procedure are consistent with this diagnosis. After the surgery, the patient experienced an oxygen desaturation despite being on a respirator with 100% oxygen at 15 breaths/minute, which is also indicative of a pulmonary embolism. The readings from the Swan-Ganz catheter show a low central venous pressure (CVP), right ventricular pressure (RVP) and pulmonary artery pressure (PAP), which are consistent with a massive pulmonary embolism. A chest x-ray shows bilateral lung opacities, which is also consistent with a pulmonary embolism.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A: Diffuse alveolar damage\""]
