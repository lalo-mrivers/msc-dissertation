["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has a history of systemic lupus erythematosus and hypertension. She developed symptoms such as dizziness, lethargy, abdominal pain, and nausea after open cholecystectomy for complicated cholecystitis. Her medications include nifedipine and prednisolone.
