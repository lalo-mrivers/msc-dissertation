["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The sequence is isolated from the patient's serum and added to a gel containing protein from her neutrophils and macrophages. This suggests an immune response and the presence of antibodies. VDJ recombination is a process where the variable (V), diversity (D), and joining (J) gene segments are rearranged to form an immunoglobulin gene, which codes for the heavy chain of an antibody. This process typically occurs in immunocompetent individuals during B-cell development and maturation. Therefore, this sequence likely undergoes VDJ recombination.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C: VDJ recombination\""]
