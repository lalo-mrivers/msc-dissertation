["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The problem is asking to find the fraction of GERD that can be prevented if alcohol consumption is stopped. We are given two groups: 200 alcoholics and 400 non-alcoholics. Out of these, 30 developed GERD in each group. This means that there is an association between alcohol use and GERD.\n\nWe want to know how many people will develop GERD if everyone stops drinking. To do this, we need to find the total number of people who developed GERD (60) and then subtract it from the total number of people with GERD in the population (100).\n\nNow, out of 10,000 people, 30% drink alcohol, which is equal to 3000 people. The remaining 7000 people do not drink. Since there is an association between drinking and GERD, we can assume that a proportion of the 3000 drinkers will develop GERD.\n\nWe know that among 200 drinkers, 30 developed GERD (15%). If we apply this rate to the total number of drinkers (3000), we get 450 people who would have developed GERD if they continued drinking. Now, out of these 450, only 30 actually did develop GERD. This means that there are 420 people who will not develop GERD if they stop drinking.\n\nFinally, we can calculate the fraction of GERD that can be prevented by stopping alcohol consumption: (420/1000).\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
