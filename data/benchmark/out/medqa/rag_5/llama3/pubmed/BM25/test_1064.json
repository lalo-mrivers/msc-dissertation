["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with recurrent episodes of swelling in her face, hands, and neck with occasional abdominal pain. The symptoms usually resolve in 2 to 3 days. She has had these swelling events her whole life; however, they have become more debilitating recently. Last week she had an event that restricted her ability to eat and swallow. Her mother and maternal aunt also have a similar condition. C1-inhibitor levels are found to be extremely low.\n\nThe patient's symptoms are consistent with hereditary angioedema (HAE). HAE is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by recurrent episodes of swelling, typically affecting the face, hands, feet, and intestinal tract. The symptoms can vary in severity and frequency, but they usually resolve within 2-3 days.\n\nThe patient's family history, including her mother and maternal aunt having a similar condition, also supports the diagnosis of HAE.\n\nThe patient's C1-inhibitor levels are extremely low, which is consistent with HAE. C1-inhibitor deficiency is a hallmark feature of HAE.\n\nChediak-Higashi syndrome, Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, and paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria are not related to the patient's symptoms or family history, so they can be ruled out as possible diagnoses.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
