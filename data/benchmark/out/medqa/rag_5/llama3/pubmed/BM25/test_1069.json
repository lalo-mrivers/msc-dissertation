["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 45-year-old woman with a rapidly growing right breast mass. The mammography shows a smooth polylobulated mass, which is not consistent with the options D: Invasive lobular carcinoma or C: Fibrocystic disease of the breast, as these would likely show calcifications or other characteristic features. Additionally, the patient does not have pain, which is unusual for invasive cancer. The biopsy shows papillary projections of epithelial-lined stroma with hyperplasia and atypia, which suggests a benign or pre-malignant process. Based on this information, the most likely diagnosis is A: Phyllodes tumor or B: Fibroadenoma.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
