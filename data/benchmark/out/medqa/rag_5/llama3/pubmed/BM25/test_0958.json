["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with symptoms of diabetes, including excessive thirst, frequent urination, and partial visual loss. The physical examination reveals signs of peripheral neuropathy, dry skin, and a rash, which are all consistent with diabetes. The laboratory results show glucosuria, as well as an HbA1c level of 9%, which suggests that the patient has had uncontrolled hyperglycemia for some time. Given the patient's family history of type 2 diabetes, it is likely that this diagnosis is accurate.\n\nThe urinalysis shows proteinuria and hematuria, which are common complications of diabetes. The presence of yeast in the urine also suggests that the patient may have a fungal infection, such as candidiasis, which can occur more frequently in people with uncontrolled diabetes.\n\nGiven these findings, it appears that the cause of this patient's glucosuria is most likely due to the disruption of secondary active transporters in the renal tubules, leading to decreased glucose reabsorption and increased excretion in the urine. This is supported by the presence of glucosuria, as well as the other laboratory abnormalities that are consistent with diabetes.\n\nTherefore, based on these findings, the best answer to this question would be B: Secondary active transporters fail to completely reabsorb glucose in the renal tubules.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
