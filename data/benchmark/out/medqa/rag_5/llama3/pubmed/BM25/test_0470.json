["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with a 1-year history of dysphagia for solids, which has recently progressed to dysphagia for liquids. He complains of food getting stuck in his throat but does not report pain while swallowing. The patient's physical examination is unremarkable, except for appearing ill and malnourished. A swallowing study reveals a small outpouching in the posterior neck.\n\nThe question asks which nerve is most likely involved in this patient's symptoms. Considering the patient's symptoms of dysphagia, food getting stuck in his throat, and no pain while swallowing, it suggests that the issue may be related to the coordination between the esophagus and the pharynx.\n\nThe small outpouching in the posterior neck seen on the swallowing study is consistent with a possible crico-pharyngeal notch or dysfunction. This would suggest involvement of CN IX (glossopharyngeal nerve) which supplies the muscles involved in swallowing and pharyngeal constriction.\", \n\"answer_choice\": \"C: CN IX\""]
