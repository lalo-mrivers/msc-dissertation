["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the respiratory function of a 76-year-old woman compared to a healthy 20-year-old woman. We need to consider the age-related changes in lung function. As we get older, our lungs naturally lose some of their elasticity and capacity. This can lead to decreased lung compliance, which means the lungs become less flexible and have a harder time expanding.\n\nThe question also mentions that the patient has no history of smoking or illicit drug use, which is good for her lung health.\n\nConsidering these factors, it's likely that this patient would show a decrease in lung function compared to a healthy 20-year-old woman. This means option B: Decreased residual volume is the most likely answer.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
