["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with bilateral knee pain that developed over time. He has tried NSAIDs before but they no longer provide relief. He also reports increasing fatigue, dozing off during work, and feeling tired in the morning. The examination reveals crepitus (creaking) of the joints, which is a common finding in patients with inflammatory arthritis such as polymyositis. The patient's family history of rheumatoid arthritis on his mother's side suggests that he may be at risk for developing an autoimmune disorder. Additionally, his severe obesity and use of metformin may contribute to his symptoms.
