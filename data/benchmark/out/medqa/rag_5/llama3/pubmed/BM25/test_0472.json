["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question states that the urinary concentration of sodium decreases while the urinary potassium increases. This suggests a direct effect on the renal tubular transport. The effect is not due to a change in water handling as urinary osmolality does not increase, unlike with somatostatin. Considering the documents, we can rule out options A and B as they do not relate to changes in sodium and potassium excretion. Aldosterone (option C) increases sodium reabsorption and potassium secretion, which is the opposite of what is observed. Spironolactone (option D) decreases aldosteronism, but it does not directly affect renal tubular transport.\n\nThe most plausible explanation for these changes in urinary electrolyte excretion is that the compound X acts on the principal cells, which are responsible for sodium reabsorption and potassium secretion. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC: Principal cells; aldosterone\n\n\", \n\"answer_choice\": C"]
