["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has sharp, shooting pain in both legs, which is similar to the symptoms described in [Two brother cases of late-onset familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy in Kyoto]. The patient also has decreased sensation to pinprick and light touch over the distal lower extremities, which suggests peripheral neuropathy. Additionally, the patient's gait is unsteady and broad-based, indicating proximal muscle weakness. The small pupils that constrict with accommodation but do not react to light suggest involvement of the autonomic nervous system. Considering these findings, it is likely that the patient has a hereditary disorder such as familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy (FAP) type I. This diagnosis is supported by the patient's history of penile ulcer 20 years ago, which is a known risk factor for FAP.\n\nThe patient's risk factors for complications include cardiomegaly and arrhythmia, which are common in patients with FAP. Additionally, the patient may have orthostatic hypotension due to autonomic dysfunction, which can lead to decreased blood pressure and increased risk of falls.\n\nBased on these findings, the patient is at increased risk for atrioventricular block, which is a known complication in patients with FAP.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
