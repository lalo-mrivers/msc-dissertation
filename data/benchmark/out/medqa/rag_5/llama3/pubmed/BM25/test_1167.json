["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 3-year-old boy who has been experiencing symptoms such as getting tired easily from swimming classes, having difficulty catching his breath, and appearing slightly shorter than other children his age. The physical examination reveals a localized harsh pansystolic murmur heard over the left sternal border at the level of the 2nd-3rd intercostal space, which becomes louder when the patient is asked to squat. An echocardiogram is performed. Based on this information, we can infer that the patient has a congenital heart defect, likely a ventricular septal defect (VSD). The murmur heard during physical examination and the fact that it increases in intensity with squatting are consistent with the typical findings of a VSD. Therefore, the defective structure giving rise to the patient's symptoms is likely the endocardial cushion.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
