["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 65-year-old man with chronic obstructive lung disease (COPD) presenting with cough, breathing difficulty, and increased expectoration. The patient has no fever and was a chronic smoker who quit 2 years ago. He is currently taking inhaled salmeterol and fluticasone propionate.\n\nThe physical examination reveals the use of accessory muscles of respiration and diminished breath sounds in both lungs. The arterial saturation of oxygen is 87%. The patient's symptoms are consistent with an exacerbation of COPD.\n\nBased on the documents provided, long-term oxygen therapy (LOT) has been shown to improve gas composition of the arterial blood and parameters such as alveolar-arterial gradient according to O2, physiological pulmonary shunt, and diffusion lung capacity. Therefore, supplementing oxygen may be beneficial for reducing the risk of subsequent exacerbations.\n\nHowever, oral prednisone is not likely to reduce the risk of exacerbations in COPD patients. Montelukast is a leukotriene receptor antagonist that has been shown to reduce symptoms and improve lung function in patients with asthma, but its effectiveness in COPD patients is uncertain. Nebulized N-acetylcysteine may be beneficial for loosening mucus and improving lung function in COPD patients, but it is not likely to reduce the risk of exacerbations.\n\nTherefore, based on the available information, supplementing oxygen (B) is the most likely medication to reduce the risk of subsequent exacerbations over the next 6 months.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
