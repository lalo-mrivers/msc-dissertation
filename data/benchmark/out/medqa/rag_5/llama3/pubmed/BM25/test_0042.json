["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's presentation is consistent with a newborn who has not passed meconium yet despite urinating multiple times since birth. The mother had gestational diabetes and received routine prenatal care but declined first trimester screening. The quadruple screen at 15 weeks gestation showed decreased AFP, increased beta-hCG, decreased unconjugated estriol, and increased inhibin A, which is suggestive of a possible neural tube defect or other congenital anomaly.\n\nThe patient's physical exam shows a firm and distended abdomen with hypoactive bowel sounds, which is consistent with a gastrointestinal obstruction.
