["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To calculate the number needed to treat (NNT), we need to find the difference between the proportions of cured participants in each group. In this case, 190/250 and 165/250 are the proportions of cured participants in the study treatment group and control group, respectively. The absolute difference is (190/250 - 165/250) = 25/250. Therefore, we need to treat 25 participants with the new drug to see one more cure compared to standard antifungal therapy.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A: 25/250\""]
