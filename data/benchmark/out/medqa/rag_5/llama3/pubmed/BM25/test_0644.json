["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the mechanism that contributes to the changes seen at point D in the graph. Since the study is investigating gastrointestinal regulatory substances, it's likely related to stomach acid secretion and pH levels. The passage mentions the interaction between alkaline and acid contents in the pathogenesis of symptoms and mucosal lesions. This suggests that there might be a connection between gastric acid production and pH levels.\n\nThe given documents discuss various aspects of gastric function, such as duodenogastric reflux, gastric motor activity, and acid secretion. They also mention the concept of antral hormone release in response to intestinal contents.\n\nPoint D in the graph likely corresponds to the peak of acid secretion or a significant change in pH levels. Based on this information, I think that increased activity of D cells contributes most to the changes seen at point D in the graph. This is because D cells are known for their role in regulating gastric acid secretion and can be stimulated by intestinal contents.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
