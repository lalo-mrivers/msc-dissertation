["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms suggest a fluent speech with comprehension, but difficulty in completing tasks involving verbal repetition. This is likely due to damage to the structures responsible for language processing. The main components of language processing are Broca's area (infratentorial gyrus) and Wernicke's area (superior temporal gyrus). Since the patient has fluent speech with comprehension, but difficulty in completing tasks involving verbal repetition, it is likely that there is damage to the connection between these two areas. This suggests damage to the arcuate fasciculus.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A: Arcuate fasciculus\""]
