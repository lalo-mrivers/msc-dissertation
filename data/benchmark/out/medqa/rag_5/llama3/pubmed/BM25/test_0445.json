["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with swelling of her right leg three days after undergoing a laparoscopic Whipple's procedure. She has nausea but no pain or vomiting. Given the recent surgery and possible post-operative complications, I will first consider the possibility of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) as the most likely cause of her swelling. However, since she does not have erythema or pitting edema, DVT is less likely. I will also consider the possibility of lymphedema due to the recent surgery, but it seems unlikely given that she has no pain and no history of lymphedema. Considering the patient's recent diagnosis with pancreatic cancer and her use of an herbal weight-loss preparation, I will also keep in mind the possibility of a medication-related adverse effect. Finally, given the patient's mild swelling and negative Homan's sign, I do not think that blood cultures are necessary at this point.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
