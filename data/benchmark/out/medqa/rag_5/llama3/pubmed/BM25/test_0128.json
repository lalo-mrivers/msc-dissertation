["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 47-year-old woman with progressive muscle weakness for five months. She has difficulty getting up from chairs, climbing stairs, and combing her hair. The neurological examination shows moderate weakness in the arm abductors and hip flexors bilaterally. Deep tendon reflexes are 2+ bilaterally. Laboratory studies show moderately elevated serum creatine kinase level (212 U/L) and lactate dehydrogenase (164 U/L). AST and ALT levels are also mildly elevated. The patient's family history is significant for maternal uncle's death from Duchenne's muscular dystrophy, which suggests a genetic component. Based on these findings, the most likely diagnosis is a muscular disorder, possibly an inherited myopathy. Muscle biopsy would be helpful in confirming the diagnosis.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: Dystrophin gene mutation on genetic analysis\""]
