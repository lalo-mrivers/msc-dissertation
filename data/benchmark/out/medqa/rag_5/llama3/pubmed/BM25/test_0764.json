["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is in active labor at 40 weeks gestation with significant blood loss. She requests a transfer to a more capable center due to the hospital's lack of equipment for high-risk pregnancies. The Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act obliges the hospital to provide treatment until the patient is stable enough for transfer or delivery. Since the patient's vital signs indicate instability, it's crucial to address her condition before considering transfer.\n\nOption D seems most relevant as it acknowledges the need to balance the medical benefits of transfer with the risks involved. However, this option doesn't prioritize the patient's request, which should be respected according to the EMTALA.\n\nConsidering the patient's condition and the husband's insistence on transfer, I think option A is the most appropriate next step in management. Declining admission and referring the patient to a closer capable emergency department prioritizes her safety and the fulfillment of her request.\n\nOption B disregards the patient's request and treats until delivery is complete, which goes against the EMTALA and the patient's autonomy.\n\nOption C is not supported by any information provided in the question or relevant documents.\n\nTherefore, I choose answer A.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
