["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, we need to identify the number of cases (individuals with hepatitis A infection) from the outbreak. This is given as 500 individuals who dined at the restaurant during the week of study and had an incidence of hepatitis A infection of 25%. Therefore, the number of cases is 500 x 0.25 = 125.\n\nNext, we need to identify the total number of deaths recorded among the incident cases. This is given as 5 individuals.\n\nFinally, to calculate the case-fatality rate (CFR), we divide the number of deaths by the number of cases and multiply by 100.\n\nCFR = (Number of deaths / Number of cases) x 100\n= (5 / 125) x 100\n= 4%\n\nSo, the case-fatality rate for the hepatitis A outbreak is 4%\",\n\"answer_choice\": A"]
