["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks to explain the difference observed between two strata of patients with different CD4+ T-lymphocyte counts at the time of diagnosis. The difference is that among patients with CD4+ cell counts below 200/mm3, cART adherence was a significant predictor of DLBCL risk (RR = 0.52, p = 0.01), while among patients with CD4+ cell counts above 200/mm3, no relationship was found between DLBCL risk and cART adherence (RR = 0.96, p = 0.36). This suggests that the effect of cART adherence on DLBCL risk is different depending on the level of CD4+ T-lymphocyte count. Therefore, this difference can be attributed to effect modification.\", \"answer_choice\": D}"]
