["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has a history of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and presents with an aching pain in her left leg that has progressively worsened over several days. She recently had a sporting incident resulting in large bruises along both legs and lower thighs. The lab results show thrombocytopenia, prolonged PTT, and a mixing study result consistent with the patient's PTT value. These findings suggest a bleeding disorder rather than a clotting disorder.\\nThe patient's history of SLE suggests an autoimmune disorder, which may be causing her symptoms.\\nHoman's sign is positive, indicating deep venous thrombosis (DVT). A Doppler ultrasound confirms the presence of a thrombus in the left popliteal vein.\\nBased on these findings, it seems likely that the patient has an underlying bleeding disorder related to her SLE rather than a clotting disorder.\\nAntibodies directed against phospholipids are commonly found in patients with SLE and can cause a bleeding disorder.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
