["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has a history of ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and is at risk for cardiac complications. The physical exam notes jugular venous distension and bilateral lower extremity pitting edema, indicating fluid overload and peripheral edema. Given the patient's ejection fraction of 55%, there may be residual left ventricular dysfunction. Considering these factors, the greatest mortality benefit would likely come from a medication that helps to reduce cardiac workload, mitigate fluid overload, and prevent further cardiovascular complications. Among the options, metoprolol succinate is an excellent choice as it is a beta blocker with a longer duration of action compared to atenolol or propranolol.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
