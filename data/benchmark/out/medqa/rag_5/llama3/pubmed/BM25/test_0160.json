["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has sickle-cell disease with splenic infarct. The physician provides vaccines against Neisseria meningitidis, Haemophilus influenzae, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. This suggests that the patient is at risk of developing infections. The slide obtained from the resected portion of the patient's spleen may show dysfunction in one or more zones. Zone 1 corresponds to the marginal zone, which plays a role in trapping pathogens and presenting antigens to immune cells. Dysfunction of this zone may predispose the patient to infections such as those caused by Neisseria meningitidis. Similarly, zone 2 corresponds to the red pulp, which is responsible for filtering old or damaged red blood cells from the circulation. Dysfunction of this zone may also contribute to an increased risk of infection. Therefore, it is likely that dysfunction of one or both of these zones predisposes the patient to infections.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C: 1 and 2\"\n}"]
