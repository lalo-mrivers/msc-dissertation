["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has a history of recurrent fetal loss, which is likely related to her systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and previous deep vein thromboses (DVTs). The patient's SLE increases the risk of miscarriage and preterm birth. Heparin therapy may be effective in preventing DVTs, but it does not directly address the issue of recurrent fetal loss. Aspirin has been shown to reduce the risk of miscarriage in women with SLE, and warfarin is often used to treat thromboembolic events related to antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). Given the patient's history, it seems that her recurrent fetal loss may be related to an underlying APS. Rivaroxaban is a direct oral anticoagulant that is not typically used for this condition.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B: Aspirin and warfarin\""]
