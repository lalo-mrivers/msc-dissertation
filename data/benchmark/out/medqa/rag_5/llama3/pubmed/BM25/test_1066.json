["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has a 2-day history of dyspnea, chest pain, and hemoptysis preceded by myalgia and low-grade fever. The x-ray shows widening of the mediastinum. A sputum culture grows gram-positive rods in gray colonies with irregular margins and wavy projections on microscopy. Given these symptoms and findings, it is likely that the patient has ovine progressive pneumonia virus (OPPV) infection, which can cause respiratory symptoms and hemoptysis.\n\nThe relevant document is 'Seroprevalence of ovine progressive pneumonia virus in sheep in the United States as assessed by analyses of voluntarily submitted samples', which states that OPPV causes a lentivirus-induced disease of sheep in the US that is similar to maedi/visna in many other countries. The patient's job processing sheep wool and hide, his travel history from Turkey, and the symptoms and findings are all consistent with OPPV infection.\n\nThe virulence factor that increased survival in host tissue is likely IgA protease, which is an enzyme produced by OPPV to evade the host immune system.\", \"answer_choice\": C}"]
