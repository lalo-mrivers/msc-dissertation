["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 95-year-old woman with multiple medical conditions, including diabetes, congestive heart failure, and incontinence. She is taking several medications, including metformin, lisinopril, hydrochlorothiazide, metoprolol, and oxybutynin. The patient presents with severe pain in her right hip and buttock, a foreshortened right leg fixed in the adducted position, and a large swelling in her right buttock.
