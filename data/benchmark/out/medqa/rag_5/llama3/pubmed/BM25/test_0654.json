["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is an 18-year-old female with primary amenorrhea. Her lab results show normal FSH levels for the follicular phase (7 mIU/mL), slightly low estradiol levels (28 pg/mL) compared to the mid-follicular phase, and normal testosterone levels. Given the presence of axillary hair, breast development, and pubic hair at Tanner stage 5, it is unlikely that she has Turner syndrome or Muellerian agenesis. Hyperprolactinemia could be a possibility, but given the normal FSH and estradiol levels, this seems less likely. Androgen insensitivity is also unlikely due to the presence of pubic hair. Considering the patient's family history and immigration background, it is possible that she has multiple endocrine neoplasia type 3 (MEN3), which can cause primary amenorrhea and other endocrine abnormalities. Therefore, MEN3 is a plausible diagnosis.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
