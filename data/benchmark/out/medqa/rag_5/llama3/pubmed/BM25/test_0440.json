["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is experiencing persistent bleeding from one nostril, which started spontaneously. There is no history of abnormal bleeding or medications taken. The examination shows no abnormalities except for the bleeding from the left nostril. Mallory-Weiss tear is a common cause of upper gastrointestinal bleeding, but it's not related to nosebleed. Psychogenic death is a condition where patients die due to psychic stimuli, but it's not relevant in this case either. Abnormal uterine bleeding can be ruled out since the patient is a 12-year-old boy. The drawing in the article about psychiatric evaluation of a defendant doesn't seem related to this case. Cysticercosis is a condition where a patient has a cystic tumor due to the larvae of the pork tapeworm, which is not relevant in this case either. Therefore, we need to look for other causes of nosebleeds. The most common cause of spontaneous epistaxis (nosebleed) is high blood pressure, which can be managed with antihypertensive medications. However, since the patient's vital signs are within normal limits, hypertension is unlikely to be the cause. A more likely cause is a vascular malformation or trauma, such as a nasal septal hematoma.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
