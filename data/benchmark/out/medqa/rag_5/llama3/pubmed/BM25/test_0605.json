["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 25-year-old man who was found acting strangely at a celebration. He denies substance use but has difficulty processing his thoughts and feels anxious. The physical exam reveals an anxious young man with a dry mouth, conjunctival injection, tachycardia, and normal neurological exam.
