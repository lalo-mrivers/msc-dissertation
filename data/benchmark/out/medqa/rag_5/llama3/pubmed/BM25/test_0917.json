["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms include sudden loss of consciousness, somnolence, and diaphoresis. His serum glucose concentration is low (22 mg/dL), which could be related to his hypoglycemic episode. The patient has a history of asthma and was previously hospitalized multiple times. His mother has type 2 diabetes mellitus. After administration of a dextrose infusion, the patient's symptoms improve and his glucose concentration normalizes. During another episode of decreased consciousness, the serum glucose concentration is again low (19 mg/dL), insulin concentration is high (108 mIU/L), and C-peptide concentration is low (0.3 ng/mL). These findings suggest a possible insulinoma or hyperinsulinism-related hypoglycemia.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
