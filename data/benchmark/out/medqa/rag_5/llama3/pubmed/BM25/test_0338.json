["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with symptoms of malaise, diarrhea, and vomiting. The physical exam reveals an ill-appearing young man with rhinorrhea, lacrimation, and piloerection. The patient's pupils are dilated and reactive to light. This suggests a possible serotonin syndrome or neuroleptic malignant syndrome due to the difficulty in placing an IV and the multiple scars in the antecubital fossa.\n\nGiven the symptoms and physical exam findings, I think step-by-step that this patient may be experiencing a withdrawal symptom from some medication he was previously taking. The patient's past medical history of constipation and fibromyalgia may also suggest a potential underlying condition that could be contributing to his current symptoms.\n\nConsidering these possibilities, I believe that an appropriate treatment for this patient's symptoms would be one that addresses the potential withdrawal symptom and provides supportive care to manage his gastrointestinal symptoms.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C: Haloperidol and diphenhydramine\"\n}"]
