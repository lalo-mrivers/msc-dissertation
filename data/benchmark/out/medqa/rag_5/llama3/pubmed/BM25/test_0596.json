["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a newborn boy delivered via Caesarian section at 41 weeks' gestation with meconium-stained amniotic fluid. He is experiencing tachypnea and increased work of breathing, which suggests respiratory distress syndrome (RDS). The fact that he was able to improve with an inhaled medication that increases smooth muscle cGMP suggests that surfactant deficiency is a likely cause of his RDS. Additionally, the echocardiography showing elevated pulmonary artery pressure supports this diagnosis.\n\nThree hours later, the patient's tachypnea persists and he develops cyanosis. This is consistent with the diagnosis of RDS as it can lead to hypoxia and cyanosis. Given that the patient was delivered via Caesarian section without labor, his surfactant production may have been compromised.\n\nConsidering the patient's history and symptoms, the most likely cause of his cyanosis is B: Closure of the ductus arteriosus.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
