["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has monoclonal gammopathy with downregulated class I major histocompatibility molecules on the plasma cells. This suggests that the immune system is not able to recognize and eliminate these abnormal cells. The proliferation of these monoclonal plasma cells is normally prevented by a class of immune cells that lyse abnormal cells without the need for opsonization, priming, or prior activation.\n\nThe patient has no evidence of multiple myeloma, macroglobulinemia, amyloidosis, or other related diseases. The bone marrow biopsy shows 6% monoclonal plasma cells.\n\nBased on these findings, it is likely that the patient's immune system is not able to effectively eliminate the abnormal plasma cells due to downregulated class I major histocompatibility molecules.\n\nThe correct answer is C: Natural killer cells.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
