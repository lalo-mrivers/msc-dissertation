["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the symptoms presented, it seems that the patient has suffered a right clavicle fracture. The pain and swelling in the right shoulder area, along with limited range of motion, are all consistent with this diagnosis. Additionally, the fact that the patient's radial pulse is intact suggests that there is no significant vascular injury.\n\nGiven this information, the most appropriate next step in management would be to apply a simple shoulder sling to immobilize the shoulder and provide support for the affected area. This will help to reduce pain and discomfort, while also allowing the fracture to heal properly.\n\nIt is not necessary to perform tension banding at this time, as this procedure is typically used to stabilize more complex fractures or dislocations. Arteriography would also be unnecessary, as there is no evidence of significant vascular injury.\n\nFinally, an MRI of the right shoulder may not be necessary at this time, as the symptoms presented are consistent with a clavicle fracture and do not suggest any underlying neurological or soft tissue injuries that would require further imaging.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B: Apply a simple shoulder sling\""]
