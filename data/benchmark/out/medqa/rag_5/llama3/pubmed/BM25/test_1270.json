["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is experiencing daytime fatigue, difficulty falling asleep at night, and excessive daytime sleepiness. He has tried over-the-counter melatonin pills and exercising without success. Given the patient's symptoms and history of substance abuse, I suspect that he may be suffering from heroin withdrawal, despite his denial. Heroin withdrawal can cause fatigue, insomnia, and increased sleepiness.\n\nI will recommend a trial of diphenhydramine (A) to help him manage his symptoms. Diphenhydramine is an antihistamine that can help with sedation and sleep promotion. It may also help alleviate some of the physical symptoms of withdrawal.\n\nThe other options are not as relevant to this patient's condition. Stopping evening exercise (B) may not have a significant impact on his symptoms, and recommending more alcohol consumption (C) is unlikely to be helpful in managing his withdrawal symptoms. Scheduled afternoon naps (D) may actually exacerbate the problem by creating an inconsistent sleep-wake cycle.\n\nTherefore, I will recommend option A: Trial of diphenhydramine.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
