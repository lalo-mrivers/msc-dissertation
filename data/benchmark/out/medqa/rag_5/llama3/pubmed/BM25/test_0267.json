["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the probability of the second daughter being a carrier of inherited hemophilia A. Since the first daughter is unaffected, it's likely that she is not a carrier. Therefore, we can use Mendel's law to estimate the probability of the second daughter being a carrier. According to Mendel's law, each child of an affected parent has a 50% chance of inheriting the disease. However, since the first daughter is unaffected, it's likely that she inherited the normal allele from her father and the affected allele from her mother. This means that the mother is a carrier. Therefore, we can apply Mendel's law again to estimate the probability of the second daughter being a carrier. Since the mother is a carrier, each child has a 50% chance of inheriting the disease. Therefore, the probability of the second daughter being a carrier is also 50%.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
