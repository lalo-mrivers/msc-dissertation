["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to understand how the prevalence of CMV retinitis affects the positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) of the diagnostic test. The PPV is the proportion of true positives among all individuals testing positive, while the NPV is the proportion of true negatives among all individuals testing negative. When the prevalence of a disease decreases, the PPV typically increases because there are fewer false positives. On the other hand, the NPV may decrease because there are more false negatives. In this case, since the prevalence of CMV retinitis decreases due to increased access to antiretroviral therapy, we would expect the PPV to increase and the NPV to decrease.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B: PPV decreases, NPV increases\""]
