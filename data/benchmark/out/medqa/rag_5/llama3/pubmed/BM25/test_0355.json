["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks which screening tests should be performed on all pregnant women. The patient has no history of sexually transmitted disease, intravenous drug use, or blood transfusions, and she has never traveled outside of the United States. She was up-to-date on all immunizations before her pregnancy. Ultrasound is consistent with an 8-week gestational sac.\n\nThe relevant documents provided do not specifically address this question. However, it can be inferred that since the patient has no history of sexually transmitted disease or intravenous drug use, and she has never traveled outside of the United States, the risk of infection is relatively low.\n\nA: HIV, syphilis, and hepatitis B\nThis option includes tests for infections that are commonly found in pregnant women. However, it does not include testing for other sexually transmitted diseases such as Chlamydia trachomatis.\n\nB: HIV, syphilis, and N. gonorrhea\nThis option includes tests for HIV, syphilis, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (N. gonorrhea), which are all common infections found in pregnant women. However, it does not include testing for hepatitis B or other sexually transmitted diseases.\n\nC: HIV, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C\nThis option includes tests for three different viral hepatitis infections: HIV, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C. While these viruses can cause serious illness in pregnant women, they are less common than syphilis or gonorrhea.\n\nD: HIV, syphilis, hepatitis B, N. gonorrhea, and C. trachomatis\nThis option includes tests for all of the above-mentioned infections. This is the most comprehensive testing option and would provide the best assurance that the patient does not have any of these infections."]
