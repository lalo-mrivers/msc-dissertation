["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with tearing and foreign body sensation in both eyes, eyelid retraction, and limited extraocular motility on upgaze. The laboratory studies show hyperthyroidism, but there is no evidence of orbital involvement or thyroid-related eye disease. However, the CT scan shows proptosis and marked enlargement of the extraocular muscle with sparing of the tendons, which suggests an underlying muscle disorder rather than a direct effect of hyperthyroidism. Therefore, it is unlikely that any of the treatment options for hyperthyroidism would worsen the patient's eye symptoms.\n\nThe most likely cause of the patient's eye symptoms is Graves' disease, an autoimmune disorder characterized by muscle and connective tissue inflammation. The eyelid retraction and limited extraocular motivity on upgaze are consistent with this diagnosis.\n\nIn patients with Graves' disease, the use of systemic corticosteroids can worsen orbital involvement and exacerbate the patient's eye symptoms. Therefore, option C is the most likely choice to transiently worsen the patient's eye symptoms.\", \"answer_choice\": C}"]
