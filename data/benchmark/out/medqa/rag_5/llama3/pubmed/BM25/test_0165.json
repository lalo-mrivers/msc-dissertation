["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, we need to identify the type of cancer being discussed. Since it is a fatal adrenal cancer with an average survival rate of 3 years after the onset of clinically significant symptoms, this suggests that the cancer is likely to be aggressive and have a poor prognosis. Next, we need to consider the impact of the screening test on the outcomes of patients. Since the study found that the screened population had statistically better outcomes, this implies that the screening test is detecting the cancer at an earlier stage when it is more treatable. Therefore, the step that should be undertaken to prevent bias in these conclusions is to use the survival rates in the analysis.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
