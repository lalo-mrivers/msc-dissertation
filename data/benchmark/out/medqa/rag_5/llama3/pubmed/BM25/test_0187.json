["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about a patient with metastatic lung cancer experiencing severe pain and having dose-limiting side-effects from oral morphine. The pain management team recommends using a medication that can reduce the opioid need through interaction with the NMDA-receptor. From the given documents, we know that Piritramide has analgesic potency and does not induce dysphoric side-effects when given in higher dose ranges. However, there is no information about Piritramide interacting with the NMDA-receptor. Fentanyl is also mentioned as an agent used in neuroleptanaesthesia, but it is not explicitly linked to interaction with the NMDA-receptor.\n\nLooking at other options, Propofol and Midazolam are both sedatives/anesthetics that do not have any information about interacting with the NMDA-receptor. Ketamine is an anaesthetic agent known for its ability to interact with the NMDA-receptor, which makes it a potential candidate for reducing opioid need.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the provided information, the most likely recommended agent would be Ketamine.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
