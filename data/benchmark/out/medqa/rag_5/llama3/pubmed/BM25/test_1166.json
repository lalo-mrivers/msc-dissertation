["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 15-year-old girl who has been experiencing worsening grades and difficulty making friends at her new high school. She avoids speaking up in class due to fear of being ridiculed by her classmates. The physical and neurologic examinations are normal, but the mental status examination reveals avoidance of eye contact, discomfort, and anxiety. Based on these symptoms, it is likely that the patient is experiencing social anxiety disorder (SAD) or generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). Clomipramine is an antidepressant medication that can be used to treat SAD, while phenelzine is a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) that can be used to treat GAD. Fluoxetine is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) that is commonly used to treat depression and anxiety disorders. Propranolol is a beta blocker that is often used to treat performance anxiety, but it is not typically used to treat social anxiety disorder. Therefore, the most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient's condition would be either Clomipramine or Fluoxetine.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
