["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 35-year-old woman with intermittent episodes of heart palpitations accompanied by chest pain localized to the left 3rd intercostal space. The palpitations are irregularly irregular and her pulse is 110/min. There is a systolic ejection murmur heard along the right upper sternal border, which suggests that there might be an obstruction in the pulmonary artery. The patient has no smoking history but drinks one to two glasses of wine on weekends. She appears nervous with fine tremors on both hands and digital swelling.\n\nThe symptoms suggest that there is a possible pulmonic stenosis or tetralogy of Fallot, which would explain the systolic ejection murmur and chest pain. The patient's pulse and blood pressure are normal for her age group, but the presence of retraction of the left upper eyelid could indicate cyanosis.\n\nThe most appropriate pharmacotherapy is not clear at this stage as more information is needed to make an accurate diagnosis.\", \"answer_choice\": A}"]
