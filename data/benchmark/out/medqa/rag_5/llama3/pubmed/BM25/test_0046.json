["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To calculate the number needed to treat (NNT), we need to find the inverse of the absolute risk reduction. First, let's identify the absolute risk reduction: 210 - 134 = 76. This represents the difference in the number of patients who died from cardiac causes between the medication 1 and medication 2 groups. Next, we'll calculate the risk of death from cardiac causes for both groups: 210/1500 = 0.14 (medication 2) and 134/1500 = 0.0899 (medication 1). The absolute risk reduction is then 0.14 - 0.0899 = 0.0501. Finally, we'll calculate the NNT by dividing the absolute risk reduction by the risk of death from cardiac causes in the medication 2 group: 0.0501 / 0.14 = 35.7. Round this value to the nearest whole number, which gives us approximately 36.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: 50\""]
