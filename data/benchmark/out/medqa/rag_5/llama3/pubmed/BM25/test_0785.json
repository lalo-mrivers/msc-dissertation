["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 6-year-old boy with abdominal distention, fatigue, night sweats, post-prandial fullness, and recurrent nonbilious vomiting. He has pale skin, hepatosplenomegaly, and shifting dullness on abdominal examination. The CT scan shows mesenteric and retroperitoneal lymph node enlargement and nodular thickening of the omentum. The biopsy specimen from an enlarged mesenteric lymph node is positive for Ki-67 nuclear antigen with a proliferation index > 99%. This suggests that the patient has non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). The presence of diffuse endobronchial infiltration and scattered NHL infiltration in the submucosal space of the left vocal cord, carina, and the bifurcation between left upper and lower bronchi is consistent with the diagnosis.
