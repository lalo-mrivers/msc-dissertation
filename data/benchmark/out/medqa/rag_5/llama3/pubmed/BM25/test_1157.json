["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 4-year-old boy with acute lymphoblastic leukemia who has undergone allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. Two weeks after the conditioning regimen started, he develops a fever of 38.5°C (101.3°F). Laboratory studies show that his hemoglobin is 8 g/dL, leukocyte count is 1400/mm3, segmented neutrophils are 20%, and platelet count is 110,000/mm3. He has a normal lymphocyte count of 87%. The patient's eosinophil count is low at 0.5% and his monocyte count is 1%. This suggests that the patient may have developed septicemia due to Streptococcus equisimilis, which is common in immunocompromised hosts such as patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The fever and laboratory findings are consistent with sepsis. Therefore, the most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient would be antimicrobial agents.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
