["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has a systolic blood pressure of 90 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure of 60 mm Hg. This indicates that the patient has hypertension with possible left ventricular filling pressure elevation. According to the document 'Hemodynamic guidelines in the treatment of acute myocardial infarction by means of vasodilators', when a patient presents elevated filling pressure and reduced cardiac output, it is assumed that the ejection fraction is reduced. Therefore, we can infer that the ejection fraction in this patient is likely low. The patient's end-systolic volume is 80 mL, which also suggests a low ejection fraction.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
