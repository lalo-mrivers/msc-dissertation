["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The new experimental drug increases the levels of incretins by preventing their degradation at the endothelium. This further increases glucose-dependent insulin production. Incretins are hormones that stimulate insulin secretion. They are degraded by enzymes such as DPP-4. Sitagliptin is a DPP-4 inhibitor, which means it prevents the degradation of incretins. Glimepiride is a sulfonylurea that stimulates insulin secretion but does not directly affect incretin levels. Canagliflozin is an SGLT2 inhibitor that increases glucose excretion in the urine and does not directly affect incretin levels or insulin production. Pioglitazone is a PPARÎ³ agonist that improves insulin sensitivity but does not directly affect incretin levels or insulin secretion. Therefore, Sitagliptin has a mechanism of action most similar to this new experimental drug.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
