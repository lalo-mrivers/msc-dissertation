["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about a graph of the relationship between lung volume and transpulmonary pressure. The dotted line corresponds to a specific lung volume. Based on the information provided, we know that functional residual capacity (FRC) is the lung volume at which static recoil pressure is negative. Since this is a graph of the relationship between lung volume and transpulmonary pressure, the dotted line likely corresponds to FRC.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
