["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus 1 year ago. He is already taking metformin as his only medication. The patient's serum glucose is 186 mg/dL and his hemoglobin A1c is 7.6%. To improve the patient's blood sugar control, the physician adds another antidiabetic drug that has a delayed onset of action. This suggests that the added drug is not an insulin or a rapid-acting agent like empagliflozin or liraglutide.\n\nGiven that the added drug has a delayed onset of action, it is likely to be a sulfonylurea or a thiazolidinedione (TZD) which are both known for their delayed onset of action. Rosiglitazone is a TZD and its delayed onset of action matches with the patient's situation.\n\nGlyburide is also a sulfonylurea that has a delayed onset of action, but it is not as commonly used as rosiglitazone due to concerns about its cardiovascular safety.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
