["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with complaints of 3 days of fatigue and dark urine, which have occurred multiple times since birth. He has a history of poorly controlled type II diabetes mellitus and was started on glipizide one week ago. The patient's eating habits are primarily fast food, although he tried a new Lebanese restaurant about one month ago.

Given that this is not an acute onset of symptoms, but rather an exacerbation of pre-existing conditions, I would focus on his recent changes in medication and diet.
