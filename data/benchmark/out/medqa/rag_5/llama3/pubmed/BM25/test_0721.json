["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has a 2-month history of episodic headaches associated with dizziness, nausea, and vomiting. An MRI shows isolated dilation of the left lateral ventricle. The dilatation is most likely caused by blockade of one of the structures that allow cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) to flow from the ventricles into the subarachnoid space. Arachnoid villi, located on the surface of the brain near the superior sagittal sinus, are responsible for reabsorbing CSF back into the bloodstream. Interventricular foramen and lateral apertures are not directly related to CSF flow from ventricles. Median aperture is not a structure that regulates CSF flow.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
