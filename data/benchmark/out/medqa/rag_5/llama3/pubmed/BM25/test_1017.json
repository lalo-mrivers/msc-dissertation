["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with fever, chills, night sweats, anorexia, malaise, progressive shortness of breath, and sharp chest pain. He has a history of lower gastrointestinal bleeding and a recent colonoscopy that reported an ulcerative lesion suggestive of colorectal cancer. The physical examination reveals non-tender erythematous lesions on the palms and soles, a holosystolic heart murmur III/VI, and mild cardiomegaly. The chest plain film shows clear lungs. The echocardiography reports the presence of vegetations involving the mitral valve.\n\nThe symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with infective endocarditis, which is often caused by Streptococcus bovis. This organism is commonly associated with colonic disease and has been previously reported to cause infective endocarditis in patients with colorectal cancer. The patient's history of lower gastrointestinal bleeding and the presence of vegetations on the mitral valve further support this diagnosis.\n\nThe other options, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Haemophilus aphrophilus, are not as strongly supported by the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
