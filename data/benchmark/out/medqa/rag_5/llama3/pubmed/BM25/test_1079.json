["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with left-sided numbness, diplopia, and blurring of vision. The diplopia is more prominent on his left-side lateral gaze, suggesting a lesion affecting the extraocular muscles on the left side. The patient has a history of ischemic stroke 9 years ago, but he recovered completely without any neurological deficits. Therefore, it is unlikely that the current symptoms are related to the previous stroke.\n\nThe patient's medical history includes type-2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and ischemic heart disease, which are not directly related to his current symptoms.\n\nGiven the lateral gaze palsy on the left side, a lesion in the cavernous sinus is a possible explanation. The cavernous sinus is a critical structure that contains nerves responsible for extraocular movements.\n\nTherefore, the most likely location of the lesion is the Cavernous sinus.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
