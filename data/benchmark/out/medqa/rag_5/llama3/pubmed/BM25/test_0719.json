["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking which enzyme is most likely to be absent in human cells with elevated bisphosphoglycerate mutase. Bisphosphoglycerate mutase is an enzyme involved in glycolysis. The other enzymes listed are not directly related to glycolysis, so we can focus on the role of each enzyme. α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase and pyruvate kinase are both key enzymes in cellular respiration, while glutathione reductase is an antioxidant enzyme. Carbonic anhydrase is involved in pH regulation. Since bisphosphoglycerate mutase is elevated, it's likely that the cells have a high glycolytic rate. This suggests that pyruvate kinase might be present at high levels to facilitate this process. α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase and glutathione reductase are not directly related to glycolysis and carbonic anhydrase is involved in pH regulation rather than glycolysis. Therefore, it's most likely that pyruvate kinase would be present at high levels.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
