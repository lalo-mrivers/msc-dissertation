["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has severe abdominal pain, vomiting, and a gangrenous perforated appendix. After the appendiceal base is ligated, the patient shows muscle rigidity and profuse diaphoresis. The end-tidal CO2 is 85 mm Hg. This suggests that the patient may be experiencing malignant hyperthermia due to the combination of haloperidol and possible genetic predisposition from his mother's Graves' disease.\n\nThe clinical scenario is not directly related to hypertension, pneumatonography, or kidney function. Therefore, we should focus on the symptoms of malignant hyperthermia.\n\nDantrolene is a medication specifically used to treat malignant hyperthermia. It works by reducing the release of calcium ions from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, which helps to relax muscle contractions and reduce hyperthermia.\n\nThe other options do not directly address the patient's condition or symptoms.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
