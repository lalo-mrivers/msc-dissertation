The patient also has a positive plantar reflex, which suggests that the lesion is above the level of the spinal cord. The MRI would show abnormalities on the brain. Given these findings, I think the diagnosis is likely to be related to an upper motor neuron lesion or a disorder affecting the corticospinal tract. Therefore, I would look for findings that support this diagnosis.\n\nThe patient's symptoms are consistent with spasticity, which is often seen in patients with lesions of the corticospinal tract. The clonus and plantar reflexes also suggest an upper motor neuron lesion.\n\nI would then think about what type of disorder could cause these symptoms. The patient's sexual history suggests a possibility of sexually transmitted disease (STD), but the patient's temperature is normal, which makes this less likely.\n\nThe MRI findings are not provided, but I would look for signs of cerebral or spinal cord lesions that could be causing the symptoms.\n\nGiven all these considerations, I think the most likely finding to support the diagnosis would be...\",\n\n\"answer_choice\": \"C: Presence of immunoglobulin bands on cerebrospinal fluid immunofixation\"\n}"]
