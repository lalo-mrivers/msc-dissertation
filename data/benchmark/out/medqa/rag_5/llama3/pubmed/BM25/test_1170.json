["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has altered mental status, fever (106Â°F), tachycardia (170/min), tachypnea (23/min), and is covered in sweat and dirt. He has a history of schizophrenia well controlled with haloperidol and is taking phenytoin for epilepsy, propranolol for anxiety and hyperthyroidism. Considering the patient's recent anesthesia for an appendectomy, his antipsychotic medication, and his other medications, I would think step-by-step about possible causes of altered mental status. One possibility is neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) due to the haloperidol therapy. Another possibility is thyroid storm, given the patient's history of hyperthyroidism and use of propranolol.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
