["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for the test's overall specificity. To find this, we need to divide the number of true negatives (patients without PD who got a negative result) by the total number of patients without PD (600). From the given information, 20 out of 600 patients without PD got a positive result, which means that 600 - 20 = 580 patients without PD got a negative result. The specificity is therefore 580 / 580 = 1.\",\n\"answer_choice\": A"]
