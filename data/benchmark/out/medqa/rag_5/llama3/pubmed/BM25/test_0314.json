["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is experiencing recurring episodes of sneezing, congestion, and itchy eyes for the past year. She has no prior history of significant illness and exercises regularly with a plant-based diet. The symptoms are likely related to an allergic reaction rather than any underlying disease. The medication prescribed is likely an antihistamine which would act by blocking histamine receptors at the H1 or H2 sites, or both. This would alleviate the patient's symptoms such as sneezing, congestion, and itchy eyes.\n\nConsidering the potential choices, option B 'Competitive blockage of muscarinic receptors' is the most likely mechanism of action for the medication in question. Muscarinic receptors are involved in allergic reactions and antihistamines work by competing with histamine for these receptor sites, thereby reducing the effects of histamine on the body.\", \"answer_choice\": B}"]
