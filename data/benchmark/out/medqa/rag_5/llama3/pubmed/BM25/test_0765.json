["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 7-year-old boy with complaints of wheezing and dyspnea. Laboratory work reveals eosinophilia and positive skin tests for allergens. This suggests that the patient's symptoms are likely due to an allergic reaction. The documents mention several studies on allergy-related topics, including one on the relationship between IgE levels and atopic disease. However, none of these studies specifically address the treatment of wheezing and dyspnea in a 7-year-old boy with eosinophilia and positive skin tests for allergens.
