["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks which test property would increase when lowering the cut-off point to 4 mm. To answer this, we need to identify the relationship between the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of the tuberculin skin testing with different cut-off points (5 mm or 4 mm). Based on the study from Brazil, we know that as we lower the cut-off point from 5 mm to 4 mm, there is an increase in test sensitivity. This means that more individuals will be classified as positive for TB when using a 4-mm cut-off point compared to a 5-mm cut-off point.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"]
