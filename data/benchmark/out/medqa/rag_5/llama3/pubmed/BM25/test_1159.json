["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has fever, abdominal pain, and rapidly progressive distension of the abdomen. He recently had an appendectomy for abscess 3 days ago. Leukocytosis is present on complete blood count. Anaerobic culture of peritoneal fluid needle aspirate shows a gram-negative pathogen. Given these symptoms, we need to consider causes that can develop shortly after surgery and lead to rapid abdominal distension. We also need to consider the anaerobic nature of the infection. One possibility is an inflammatory process in the abdomen, such as omental bursitis or peritonitis. However, based on the patient's history and symptoms, tuberculous peritonitis seems less likely. Another possibility is actinomycosis, but this is typically a chronic condition that develops over months or years, not within days of surgery. Therefore, we need to consider other causes that can lead to rapid abdominal distension in the post-operative period.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
