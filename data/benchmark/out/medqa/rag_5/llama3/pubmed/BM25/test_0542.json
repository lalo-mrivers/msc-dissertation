["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks for the most likely cause of an elevated maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) level at 16 weeks' gestation, along with normal levels of serum β-hCG, estriol, and inhibin A. Given that the patient is asymptomatic and has no history of serious illness, we can rule out partial molar pregnancy. An elevation in maternal serum AFP can be caused by various factors including fetal developmental defects, placental abnormality, or leakage from the amniotic fluid into the maternal circulation. Since neural tube defects typically present with elevated alpha-fetoprotein levels in both the maternal and amniotic fluids, we can also rule this out as a cause. The fact that the patient's levels of β-hCG, estriol, and inhibin A are normal suggests that there is no obvious placental or fetal defect. Therefore, we are left with the possibility of an abnormal placenta being the most likely cause.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
