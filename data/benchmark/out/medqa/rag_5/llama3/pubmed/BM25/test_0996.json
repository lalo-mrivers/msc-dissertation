["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The provided documents describe the structure and function of immunoglobulin A (IgA). The main point is that IgA exists as a polymer with multiple subunits held together by disulfide bonds. The dimer form of IgA is specifically mentioned to be resistant to reductive cleavage and has a sedimentation coefficient of 10.2 S, which releases J chain upon reduction with dithiothreitol. The primary function of the dimer form of IgA is not explicitly stated in the documents, but based on the information provided, it can be inferred that its main role is related to mucosal immunity and protection against infections.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C: Inhibiting bacterial adherance and colonization of mucous membranes\""]
