["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The investigator is studying bacterial adaptations to the environment. The non-infectious isolate of Hemophilus influenzae type B does not cause symptoms when exposed to animals. However, when this non-infectious isolate is grown in a culture with lysed bacteria from the infectious isolate, some of the animals exposed to these bacteria develop symptoms of infection. This suggests that something has changed about the non-infectious isolate as a result of being cultured with the infectious isolate. The most likely explanation is that the non-infectious isolate has acquired genetic material from the infectious isolate through recombination.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
