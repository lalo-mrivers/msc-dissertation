["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's laboratory tests show an elevated WBC count (29,500/mm3), hematocrit (26.1%), hemoglobin (9.1 g/dL) and platelet count (298,000/mm3). The peripheral blood smear and differential reveal 92% small normocytic lymphocytes, which is confirmed by bone marrow biopsy and flow cytometry. This suggests a diagnosis of lymphoma, possibly Ki-1 lymphoma. The patient's symptoms include swollen cervical and axillary lymph nodes, unintentional weight loss, and 'rib pain' on the right side, which are consistent with advanced stages of lymphoma.
