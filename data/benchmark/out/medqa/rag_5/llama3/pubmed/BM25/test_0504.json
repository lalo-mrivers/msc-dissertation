["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 3-year-old boy with a history of recurrent ear infections treated with antibiotics since birth. He has a conductive hearing loss on both sides, which suggests a middle ear problem. The retracted tympanic membranes bilaterally that are immobile on pneumatic otoscopy suggest a possible chronic middle ear effusion. The patient's mother reports difficulty understanding the boy's speech over the past 8 months, and he has trouble responding to his name and following instructions. This suggests that his hearing loss is affecting his communication abilities. Given these findings, the most appropriate next step in management would be to consider inserting tympanostomy tubes to drain any middle ear effusion and improve his hearing.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B: Tympanostomy tube insertion\"\n}"]
