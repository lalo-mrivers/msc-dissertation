["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 24-year-old woman who has had regular menses since menarche at age 12. Her last menstrual period was 3 weeks ago. She does not wish to become pregnant until she finishes college in six months. The urine pregnancy test is negative, so it's likely that the patient is not currently pregnant. However, there is still a possibility of pregnancy due to unprotected intercourse. We need to consider emergency contraception options. Mifepristone and ulipristal acetate are both FDA-approved for emergency contraception, but they require a prescription. Copper-containing intra-uterine devices (IUDs) are not suitable for emergency contraception in this case because the patient is not currently pregnant.\n\nDepot medroxyprogesterone acetate is an injectable form of hormonal birth control that can be used for emergency contraception, but it's not as effective as mifepristone or ulipristal acetate. However, it's an option that doesn't require a prescription and has been shown to be effective in preventing pregnancy when used within 72 hours after unprotected intercourse.\n\nThe most appropriate next step in management is to administer depot medroxyprogesterone acetate as emergency contraception, given the patient's desire not to become pregnant until she finishes college.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
