["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question describes a 7-month-old male infant who develops severe sunburns every time he is exposed to sunlight. The patient's skin shows reddened areas primarily in sun-exposed areas, and his corneas appear irritated and erythematous. This information suggests that the child may have a condition related to sunlight exposure. The relevant documents mention various conditions such as melanoma, porphyria, and mycoplasma meningitis. However, none of these conditions seem directly related to sunburns or skin irritation. One possibility is that the patient has a rare genetic disorder, which is unlikely based on the available information. Therefore, it is likely that the patient's condition is related to sunlight exposure.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
