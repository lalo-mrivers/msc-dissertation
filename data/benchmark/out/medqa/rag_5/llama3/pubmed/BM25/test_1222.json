["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient was prescribed a selective alpha-1 agonist for a follow-up appointment three days after initial prescription. The patient reported improvement in symptoms and no adverse effects. Considering the options, we can rule out bronchospasm due to asthma (A) as it is not directly related to the medication. Nasal congestion due to viral infection (C) is also unlikely, given that the patient's symptoms improved. Urinary hesitancy due to benign prostatic hyperplasia (B) could be a possible option, but we need more information. Finally, blood pressure management prior to pheochromocytoma excision (D) seems the most plausible choice, as alpha-1 agonists are often used for hypertension treatment.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
