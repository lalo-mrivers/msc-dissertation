The scraping of the white plaques revealing a characteristic morphology after being treated with KOH supports this diagnosis.\n\nThe patient's normal serum protein electrophoresis suggests that he does not have hypoparathyroidism or partial albinism, which are both genetic conditions.\n\nThrombocytopenic purpura is an autoimmune condition that can cause bleeding disorders. However, based on the patient's symptoms and physical exam findings, it is unlikely that he has thrombocytopenic purpura.\n\nTherefore, the most likely finding in this patient would be a fungal infection such as oral thrush.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
