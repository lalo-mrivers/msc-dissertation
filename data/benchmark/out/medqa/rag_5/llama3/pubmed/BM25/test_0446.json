["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the potential side effects of a class I anti-arrhythmic drug. The drug is a sodium channel blocker that slows phase 0 depolarization and prolongs action potential duration, but does not shorten phase 3 repolarization. It also has mild anticholinergic and alpha-blocking activity. The options provided are related to different body systems, such as cardiovascular (pedal edema), sensory (tinnitus), respiratory (pulmonary fibrosis), thyroid (hypothyroidism), and skin (corneal deposits). Therefore, the correct answer would be a combination of side effects that affect multiple body systems.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
