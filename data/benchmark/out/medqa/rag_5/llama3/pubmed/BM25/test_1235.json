["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has a disease that leads to recurrent upper respiratory infections, requiring antibiotic prophylaxis and chest physiotherapy. She also takes pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy. This information suggests that the patient has cystic fibrosis (CF). The prevalence of CF is 1/2500 in the general population. Since she marries someone without the disease from a population where the prevalence is 1/100, we can assume that her partner is not affected by CF.\n\nThe probability of the child having the disease depends on whether the mother or father contributes the mutated gene. The father does not have the disease, so his contribution will be unaffected. The mother has the disease, which means she carries two copies of the mutated gene (homozygous).\n\nWhen a person with CF has children, they will always pass one copy of their mutated gene to each child. Since the father is not affected, he will contribute a normal gene to each child.\n\nThe probability that the child inherits the mutated gene from the mother is 1/2 (50%). This means the child has a 1/4 chance (25%) of inheriting two copies of the mutated gene and being homozygous like their mother. The remaining 75% will have one copy of the mutated gene and be heterozygous, which is also known as a carrier.\n\nThe probability that the child will not inherit the mutated gene from the mother is also 1/2 (50%). In this case, the child will receive two normal genes, one from each parent, and will not have CF.\n\nTherefore, the chance that their child will have the disease of interest is 25%.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A: 9/100\"\n}"]
