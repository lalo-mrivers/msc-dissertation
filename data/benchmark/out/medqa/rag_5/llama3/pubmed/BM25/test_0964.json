["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is presenting with intermittent vertigo, vomiting, and complete hearing loss in the left ear. She has a past medical history of uterine fibroids and takes mifepristone daily. The otoscopy reveals a suppurative, erythematous, bulging tympanic membrane that is immobile. The pure-tone audiometry testing shows hearing loss across all frequencies in the left ear. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count and neutrophil count, suggesting an infectious process.\n\nGiven the symptoms and laboratory findings, it appears that the patient has a bacterial infection of the middle ear, likely caused by Ehrlichia sp. other than E. sennetsu, as she had recently returned from Mali where such infections are common. The tympanic membrane is bulging and immobile, suggesting a perforation or a severe inflammation.\n\nThe antibiotic choice should be directed against the suspected causative agent, which in this case is likely to be an Ehrlichia sp. Cefotaxime or cefepime would be appropriate choices as they have been shown to be effective against Ehrlichiosis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B: Cefotaxime\"}"]
