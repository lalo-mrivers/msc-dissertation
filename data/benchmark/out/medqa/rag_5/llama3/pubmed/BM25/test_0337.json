["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 22-year-old woman who has been diagnosed with cyanosis, dyspnea, and a cardiac murmur. The murmur was first detected in her childhood, but she has had no proper follow-up since then. During her pregnancy, her symptoms have worsened. She complains of dizziness and occasional dyspnea on exertion.\n\nFirstly, we need to consider the physiological changes that occur during pregnancy. One of the significant changes is an increase in cardiac output due to the demands of fetal growth and placental function.\n\nNext, we need to evaluate the patient's symptoms. Cyanosis and a fixed splitting of S2 are consistent with right-sided heart failure or tricuspid regurgitation. The midsystolic murmur could be indicative of tricuspid regurgitation.\n\nGiven these findings, it is likely that the increase in cardiac output during pregnancy has exacerbated her underlying condition, possibly due to pre-existing tricuspid valve insufficiency.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC: Increase in cardiac output\n\nThis physiological change has contributed to the worsening of her symptoms during pregnancy.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"]
