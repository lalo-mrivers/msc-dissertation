["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with a slowly growing left neck mass and is diagnosed with Hodgkin's lymphoma. After the first cycle of chemotherapy, he notices red urine on further analysis which tests positive for blood. This suggests that the chemotherapy has caused hematuria (blood in the urine). Considering the options, we are looking for an agent known to cause hematuria as a side effect.\n\nBleomycin is known to cause hematuria and other bladder symptoms such as irritation and inflammation. Cyclophosphamide can also cause hematuria due to its mechanism of action which involves damaging normal tissue, including the uroepithelium, leading to bleeding.\n\nDoxorubicin is an anthracycline that can cause myelosuppression and mucositis but is not typically associated with hematuria. Etoposide is a topoisomerase inhibitor that primarily causes alopecia, nausea, and vomiting as side effects.\n\nGiven the patient's symptoms, it is most likely that Doxorubicin caused the hematuria.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
