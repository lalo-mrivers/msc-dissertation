["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The case presented has two newborns with different weights (2050-g and 2850-g) delivered at 37 weeks' gestation to a gravida 2, para 1 woman. The mother had no prenatal care. One of the newborns shows a flattened nose and left-sided clubfoot, which suggests congenital anomalies. Hematocrit values also differ significantly between the two newborns (42% vs 71%).
