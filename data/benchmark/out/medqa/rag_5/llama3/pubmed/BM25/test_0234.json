["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has a 3-month history of a progressively growing mass in his axilla, along with recurrent episodes of low-grade fever and weight loss. The laboratory findings show an elevated serum calcium concentration (15.1 mg/dL) and parathyroid hormone (PTH) concentration (9 pg/mL). A lymph node biopsy shows granuloma formation and large CD15-positive, CD30-positive cells with bilobed nuclei. Given the patient's symptoms and laboratory findings, it is likely that he has a plasma cell disorder, such as POEMS syndrome or multiple myeloma. The elevated serum calcium concentration suggests excessive production of PTH-related peptide by malignant cells.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
