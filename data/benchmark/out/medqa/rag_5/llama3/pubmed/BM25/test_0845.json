["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, we can see that cartilaginous injuries have a different healing pattern compared to bone fractures. The investigator hypothesizes that this is due to the absence of progenitor cells for matrix regeneration. To promote healing in the group with cartilaginous injury, we need to provide the necessary progenitor cells. Perichondrium contains chondrocytes and mesenchymal stem cells which are capable of differentiating into chondrocytes and forming new cartilage. This makes perichondrium the most likely tissue to promote healing in the group with cartilaginous injury.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
