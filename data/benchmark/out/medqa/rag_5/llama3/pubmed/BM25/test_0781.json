["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the expression of HIF-1a in renal cell carcinoma under normoxic conditions. Since RCC can mimic hypoxia to promote angiogenesis by inhibiting HIF-1a hydroxylation, it's likely that the researcher will not detect increased HIF-1a under normoxic conditions. The normal regulation of HIF-1a involves its degradation through VHL-mediated hydroxylation in normoxia.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
