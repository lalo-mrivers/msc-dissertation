The family history shows two similar cases in male cousins on the mother's side. A urinalysis reveals a high level of uric acid. This suggests a genetic disorder related to purine metabolism. In 'Evidence for X-linkage of phosphoribosylpyrophosphate synthetase in man', we find a similar family with gouty symptoms and an enzyme mutation transmitted in an X-linked recessive pattern. This is compatible with the clinical and biochemical data presented. Therefore, it is likely that the mode of inheritance for this disorder is X-linked recessive.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
