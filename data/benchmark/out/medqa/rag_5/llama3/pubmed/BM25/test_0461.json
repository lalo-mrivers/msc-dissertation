He has hyperlipidemia and was diagnosed with major depressive disorder 3 years ago. He works as a lawyer and enjoys his job, but he has had a great deal of stress lately.

This could include cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or other forms of talk therapy that focus on helping the patient manage his stress and anxiety, which may be contributing to his ED. Additionally, the patient's psychiatrist could consider adjusting his medication regimen to address any potential interactions between his medications and his ED.\n\nIt is important to note that penile prosthesis insertion is a surgical procedure that is typically reserved for men who have tried other forms of treatment without success. Nocturnal penile tumescence testing may be useful in diagnosing ED, but it is not necessarily the next step in management.
