["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with a headache and a grape-like mass protruding from her vagina. The fundus of the uterus is at the level of the umbilicus, suggesting she is likely around 32 weeks pregnant. However, on USG examination, no fetal parts are seen. This could be due to the fact that the pregnancy is not viable or the fetus has died in utero. Based on this information, I would conclude that the patient has a non-viable pregnancy and will likely undergo dilation and evacuation (D&E).
