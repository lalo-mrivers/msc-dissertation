["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about detecting the genetic material of HIV in a child. Since the mother's haphazard use of anti-retroviral medications may have led to transmission, we are looking for an assay that can detect HIV genetic material in the child. The relevant documents do not provide information on HIV-IgA immunoblot assay results for children under 6 months old, but they mention the Centers for Disease Control's classification system. Therefore, we should look at the documents related to perinatal HIV infection diagnosis. According to 'Clinical utility of HIV-IgA immunoblot assay in the early diagnosis of perinatal HIV infection', the HIV-IgA immunoblot assay is used to diagnose perinatal HIV infection in infants tested at birth to 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months of age. Since we are looking for an assay that detects genetic material, we can eliminate options A (ELISA), B (Rapid HIV antibody test), and C (Polymerase chain reaction) as they detect antibodies or antigens. Therefore, the only remaining option is D: Southern blot, which detects specific DNA sequences.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
