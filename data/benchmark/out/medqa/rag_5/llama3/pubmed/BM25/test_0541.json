["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"We are presented with a study that examines the relationship between educational status and young age myocardial infarction (MI). The association is tested using a chi-square test, which yields an odds ratio of 2.1 for the association between low education and the risk of MI. However, this odds ratio is not statistically significant due to its wide confidence interval (0.9-9.7). Therefore, we cannot infer that low educational status is a risk factor for young age MI based on this study alone.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
