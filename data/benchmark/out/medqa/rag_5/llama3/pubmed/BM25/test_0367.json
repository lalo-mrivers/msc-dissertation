["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with symptoms consistent with rubella infection. The patient's serology 1 year ago showed Rubella IgG at 1:128, indicating previous exposure to rubella virus. Currently, the patient has a negative Rubella IgM and a decreased Rubella IgG titer (1:64). This suggests that the patient has had an episode of rubella infection in the past, but the current symptoms are consistent with postnatal rubella infection. The patient's vital signs are normal, and there is no evidence of organ involvement.\n\nThe patient's concern for the baby is understandable. However, it is essential to determine whether the fetus has been infected or not. Chorionic villus sampling (CVS) could be an option to determine fetal infection status.\n\nA pregnancy termination recommendation would be premature at this point without conclusive evidence that the fetus has been infected.\n\nThe patient's vaccination history cannot be confirmed, and even if she is vaccinated postpartum, it may not provide immediate protection against transmission to the fetus.\n\nBased on the available information, a more accurate assessment of fetal infection status through CVS or other diagnostic tests should be considered.\", \n\"answer_choice\": C"]
