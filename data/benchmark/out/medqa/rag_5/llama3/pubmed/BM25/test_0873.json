["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 2-hour-old newborn boy born by cesarean delivery to a gravida 2, para 0 mother with known hepatitis B. The mother had made it to all her prenatal appointments and taken the recommended dose of folic acid since conception. She had also given up smoking when she discovered she was pregnant. The infant's heart rate is 150/min, respiratory rate is 48/min, temperature is 37.5°C (99.5°F), and blood pressure is 80/52 mm Hg. APGAR testing exhibits a score of 7 and 8 at 1 and 5 minutes, respectively. The head is normocephalic. No neural tube defects are present on inspection or palpation of the spine. There is strong flexion in all 4 extremities. Cranial nerves 2–12 are intact. Sensory and deep tendon reflexes are without any abnormalities.\n\nThe mother's hepatitis B status should be evaluated to determine if the infant needs treatment. If the mother is HBsAg positive, HBeAg positive, or has a high viral load (HBV DNA greater than 1 million IU/mL), the infant may need both hepatitis B vaccine and HBIG (immunoglobulin). If the mother's HBV DNA level is normal or low (< 1 million IU/mL), only hepatitis B vaccine may be needed.\n\nThe options provided do not include the option to administer HBIG alone, as this would not be recommended if the mother's viral load is normal or low. Therefore, the best course of action for the newborn child would be to check his hepatitis B serology and then determine whether he needs only hepatitis B vaccine or both vaccine and HBIG.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: Check hepatitis B serology\""]
