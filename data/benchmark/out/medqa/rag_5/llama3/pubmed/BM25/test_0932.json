["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with bilateral knee pain that has worsened over time. The patient experiences pain with activity, which is alleviated by rest, suggesting an inflammatory process. The physical examination reveals tenderness to palpation of the medial aspect of the knees, crepitus, and decreased range of motion, indicating osteoarthritis. The patient's age, 64 years old, and the presence of bony enlargement on the medial joint line also support this diagnosis. Therefore, no further laboratory tests such as CBC or ESR are necessary.
