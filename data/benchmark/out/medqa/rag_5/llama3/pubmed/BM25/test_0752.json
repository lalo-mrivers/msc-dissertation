["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is experiencing thrombocytopenia (platelet count of 50,000/mm3) and pancytopenia (low white blood cell count with 2% monocytes). The patient's hemoglobin level remains stable. Considering the patient's history of breast cancer and chemotherapy, it is possible that the new medication is causing these changes in blood counts.
