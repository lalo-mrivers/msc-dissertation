["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about a 75-year-old woman who has a viral infection confirmed by PCR. The son reports that he and other family members have had similar symptoms but he himself remains asymptomatic. This suggests that the virus may not be causing disease in the son, possibly due to some immune-related mechanism. Looking at the options, we can see that A refers to serum antibodies against hemagglutinin which is not relevant here as it's a PCR test result and not an antibody test. B is about ICAM-1 expression which might have something to do with immunity but doesn't explain why the son would be immune. C mentions protease-resistant antibodies in nasal secretions, which could potentially protect the son from infection, making this option plausible. D refers to a genetic mutation in the CCR5 gene which has been linked to resistance to certain viruses, and it's possible that the son has such a mutation that makes him resistant to the virus. The most likely explanation would be the presence of protease-resistant antibodies in nasal secretions (C) or the homozygous mutation in the CCR5 gene (D), as these options provide an immune-related mechanism for the son's asymptomatic state.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"]
