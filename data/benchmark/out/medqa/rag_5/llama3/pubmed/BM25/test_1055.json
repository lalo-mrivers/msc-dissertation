["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has painless subcutaneous nodules on the back of the wrist, outside elbow, and front of the knees, as well as inflammation in the joints of the lower extremities. This pattern is consistent with the description of a limp in childhood, where diseases alter locomotion. The patient's condition can be classified into one of five ways: shortened extremity, contracture, loss of supporting structures, pain, and paralysis. Based on the symptoms, I would rule out shortened extremity and contracture. Loss of supporting structures is less likely given the presence of nodules. Pain is not explicitly mentioned as a symptom, but it's possible that the patient may be experiencing joint pain due to inflammation. Paralysis is unlikely given the patient's ability to walk normally.\n\nThe most likely classification would be 'pain', which can cause a limp. This pattern can also be seen in conditions like juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA). JIA is known to cause nodules and inflammation in joints, which aligns with the patient's symptoms.\", \n\"answer_choice\": C"]
