["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the effects of a medication commonly used to treat hypertensive emergency. The given documents explain that nitrovasodilators release nitric oxide as a metabolite, which activates guanylate cyclase and increases production of cGMP in vascular smooth muscle. This leads to vasodilation and decreased blood pressure.\n\nThe patient has an acutely elevated blood pressure of 220/140 mmHg, so the medication is expected to decrease blood pressure. According to the documents, nitrovasodilators cause both arterial and venous smooth muscle dilation by releasing nitric oxide, leading to a reduction in preload and afterload.\n\nSince the patient has hypertension with symptoms such as headache and chest pain, it is likely that the patient's cardiac contractility is not significantly affected. The increased left ventricular end-diastolic pressure could be due to the high blood pressure, but the medication would rather decrease this pressure by reducing afterload.\n\nThe stroke volume might be decreased due to the decreased blood pressure, but the document does not explicitly state it. Lastly, the pulmonary capillary wedge pressure is not directly related to the effects of nitrovasodilators on blood pressure.\n\nBased on the step-by-step thinking, the correct answer would be a combination of increased left ventricular end-diastolic pressure and decreased stroke volume.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
