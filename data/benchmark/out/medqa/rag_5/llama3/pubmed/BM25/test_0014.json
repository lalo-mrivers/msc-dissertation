["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about a specific process where 2 viruses from the same family infect a host cell, produce genome segments, package them into a new virus particle, which is stable and viable. This process is described in one of the provided documents as 'replication by reverse transcription'. The document also mentions that each strand of the CoYMV genome is interrupted by site-specific discontinuities. This information suggests that Commelina yellow mottle virus (CoYMV) is capable of undergoing this process.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
