["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with unintentional weight loss, high-grade fever, night sweats, fatigue, and generalized painless lymphadenopathy. The laboratory studies show a hematocrit of 42%, leukocyte count of 15,000/mm3, eosinophils 1%, lymphocytes 50%, monocytes 3%, and platelet count of 120,000/mm3. The blood smear shows mature lymphocytes that rupture easily, and flow cytometry reveals lymphocytes expressing CD5, CD19, CD20, and CD23.
