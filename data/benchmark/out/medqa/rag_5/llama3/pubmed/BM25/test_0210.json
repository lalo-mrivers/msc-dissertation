["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The investigator is studying the effect of drug X on the retinoblastoma (Rb) gene. Drug X activates cyclin-dependent kinase 4, which phosphorylates Rb protein. Phosphorylation of Rb protein allows cells to progress from G1 phase to S phase. Therefore, it is likely that the action of drug X on the Rb gene will result in the initiation of S phase.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"]
