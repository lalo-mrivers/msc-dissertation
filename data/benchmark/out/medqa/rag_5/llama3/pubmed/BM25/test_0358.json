["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 3-year-old girl with an acute arm injury. The mother reports that the dad was swinging her by her arms when she heard a click and started crying. On examination, the patient's forearm is pronated and elbow slightly flexed, with pain localized to the lateral aspect of the elbow. She refuses to use the affected limb but allows passive flexion and extension. Supination causes limited motion and pain.
