["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has a history of adult polycystic kidney disease and was on maintenance hemodialysis prior to transplantation. He is experiencing pain in the right lower abdomen and generalized fatigue 10 days after transplant, with decreasing urinary output. The graft site shows tenderness to palpation. Laboratory results show elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine concentrations. A biopsy of the transplanted kidney shows tubulitis, but C4d staining is negative.\\r\\n\\r\\nConsidering the patient's history and laboratory findings, it is unlikely that recipient T-cells in the graft are causing the patient's symptoms (choice A). Fibrosis of glomerular vessels is also unlikely given the presence of tubulitis on biopsy (choice C). Newly formed anti-HLA antibodies could potentially cause rejection, but the negative C4d staining suggests this is not the case (choice D).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe most likely explanation for the patient's findings is drug-induced nephrotoxicity. The patient is receiving azathioprine, cyclosporine, and enalapril, all of which have the potential to cause nephrotoxicity. Cyclosporine is a well-known cause of nephrotoxicity in transplant patients.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
