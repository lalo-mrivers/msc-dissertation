["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with hip and back pain, which is exacerbated by lifting a heavy object. He describes the pain as electrical and radiates down his leg. Considering the patient's history of obesity, diabetes, depression, anxiety, diverticulosis, constipation, and surgical repair of anterior cruciate ligament, I would think about possible underlying conditions that could be contributing to this presentation.
