["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To calculate the dosage of amoxicillin, we first need to determine the total daily dose. Since the patient needs to maintain a steady state, the total daily dose should be equal to the product of the plasma clearance and the target plasma concentration.\n\nThe plasma clearance is 15.0 L/h, and the target plasma concentration is 2 mg/L. Therefore, the total daily dose is:\n\nTotal daily dose = Plasma clearance x Target plasma concentration\n= 15.0 L/h x 2 mg/L\n= 30 mg\n\nSince the oral bioavailability is 75%, we need to adjust the total daily dose by dividing it by the bioavailability.\n\nAdjusted total daily dose = Total daily dose / Oral bioavailability\n= 30 mg / 0.75\n= 40 mg\n\nFinally, since the patient needs to take the medication twice a day, the dosage per dose should be half of the adjusted total daily dose:\n\nDosage per dose = Adjusted total daily dose / Number of doses per day\n= 40 mg / 2\n= 20 mg\n\nHowever, this is not one of the available options. Therefore, we need to calculate the dosage per dose based on the available options.\n\nThe highest available option is 540 mg, which is much higher than our calculated value. The lowest available option is 240 mg, which is also too high. The next available option is 480 mg, which is still too high. However, the option 270 mg is closer to our calculated value of 20 mg.\n\nTherefore, we will choose the option B: 480 mg.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
