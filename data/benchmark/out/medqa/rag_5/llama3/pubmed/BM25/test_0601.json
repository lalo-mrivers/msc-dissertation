["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the pattern of glutamate release from presynaptic nerve terminals. Glutamate is released through a process called exocytosis, which involves the fusion of vesicles with the plasma membrane. According to the provided documents, the release of glutamate is calcium-dependent. Calcium influx into the presynaptic terminal triggers the release of glutamate. Therefore, it is most likely that the influx of calcium occurs immediately prior to the release of neurotransmitters.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
