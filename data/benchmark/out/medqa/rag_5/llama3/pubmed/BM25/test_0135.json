["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the primary function of a protein bound to CD8. The relevant documents describe the expression of CD8 on T cells and dendritic cells. There is no mention of complement proteins or endogenous peptides in these documents. However, it is mentioned that CD11b (Mac-1) is expressed by a subset of CD8+ T cells that include both active virus-specific CTL and memory CTL populations.\n\nThis information suggests that the protein bound to CD8 may be involved in cell-cell interactions or immune response. The document about CD11b describes its role in activating and marking certain antigen-presenting DC with a veto function.\n\nGiven this information, it is most likely that the protein bound to CD8 is TCR (T cell receptor) alpha chain from an adjacent T cell. This would enable the CD8+ T cells to recognize antigens presented by MHC class I molecules on the surface of infected cells or tumor cells and execute their effector functions.\n\nThis function aligns with option C: Binds endogenous peptides that have been transported by the TAP channel.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
