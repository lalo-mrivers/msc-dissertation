["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has a connective tissue disorder caused by impaired copper absorption and transport. The patient's hair is tangled and has a dry, brittle texture. This suggests Menkes disease which is an X-linked recessive disturbance of copper metabolism. The molecular basis of the copper disturbance has proven difficult to define and will most likely have to await cloning of the gene. The chromosomal region of interest has now been narrowed down to a sub-band on the long arm of the chromosome (Xq13.3), and positional cloning is in progress in a number of laboratories including our own. Identification of the Menkes gene will be of importance for our understanding of the cellular handling of copper and other trace elements.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
