["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about a 20-year-old healthy man who has just finished exercising on a treadmill. The heart rate increased from 70/min to 130/min, and the blood pressure increased from 114/74 mm Hg to 145/75 mm Hg. This suggests that there was an increase in sympathetic nervous system activity, as this is typically seen during exercise.\n\nThe baroreceptor reflex is a mechanism by which the body regulates blood pressure through changes in vascular resistance and heart rate. However, it is not directly related to the increase in heart rate and blood pressure seen here, as the baroreceptors are primarily sensitive to changes in blood pressure.\n\nVasopressin release from the pituitary gland is not typically involved in short-term physiological responses like exercise.\n\nTherefore, the most likely explanation for the change in his heart rate and blood pressure is an increase in sympathetic nervous system activity.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
