The patient is sexually active with multiple partners and admits to using barrier protection inconsistently. She denies fever, chills, abdominal pain, menorrhagia, or flank pain. Speculum examination reveals vaginal erythema with a profuse, greenish-yellow, purulent, malodorous discharge. The vaginal pH is 5.5.
