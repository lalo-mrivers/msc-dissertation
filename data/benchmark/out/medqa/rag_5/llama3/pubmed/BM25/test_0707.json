["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with vomiting and diarrhea, indicating a possible gastrointestinal issue. The fact that she was initially unable to tolerate any solids or liquids by mouth suggests that the symptoms may be related to excessive fluid loss. With dehydration likely, the patient's blood pressure is low at 120/60 mm Hg, and her heart rate is normal at 60/min. Her physical examination reveals dry mucous membranes and slightly sunken eyes, further supporting the diagnosis of dehydration.\n\nThe question asks about sodium reabsorption in the kidneys, which is relevant to this patient's condition. Sodium reabsorption occurs primarily in the proximal tubule, with a smaller amount reabsorbed in the distal tubule.\n\nGiven the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, it is likely that most of the sodium reabsorption is occurring in the proximal tubule.\", \"answer_choice\": C}"]
