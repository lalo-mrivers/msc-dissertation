["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the maintenance dose, we need to calculate the loading dose first. The target plasma concentration is 15 mg/L, and the desired time to achieve this is every 8 hours. Since the drug half-life is 2 hours, the steady-state plasma concentration will be achieved after 4-5 half-lives, which is approximately 10 hours (2 * 5 = 10). To calculate the loading dose, we need to determine how much of the drug should be administered to achieve the target plasma concentration in 10 hours. Since the volume of distribution is 14.3 liters and the bioavailability is 50%, the total amount of drug absorbed will be 0.5 * (15 mg/L) * 14.3 L = 107.5 mg.\n\nThe loading dose should be enough to achieve the target plasma concentration within the desired time frame, so we'll add some extra to ensure it's reached in 10 hours. Let's assume an extra 20% of the total amount is required (107.5 mg * 1.2 = 129 mg).\n\nNow that we have the loading dose, we can calculate the maintenance dose by dividing it by the dosing interval (8 hours) and then multiplying it by the bioavailability.\n\nLoading dose: 129 mg\nDosing interval: 8 hours\n\nMaintenance dose: (129 mg / 8 hours) * 0.5 = 804 mg\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C: 1200 milligrams\""]
