["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presented with sudden loss of consciousness while pitching in a baseball game. There is no history of injury. Consciousness was regained after cardiopulmonary resuscitation. A prominent A wave on the jugular venous pulse and a double apical impulse are present. An S4 is also audible. The past medical history is negative for any neurological and cardiovascular problems. The patient's physical examination findings suggest that the problem might be related to cardiac function, possibly due to abnormal heart valve dynamics or cardiomyopathy. Upon reviewing the provided documents, I see that Acute Labyrinthine Disorders mention Meniere's disease, vestibular neuronitis, benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, and true labyrinthitis as potential peripheral etiologies, but these conditions do not seem relevant in this case. The patient's symptoms are more related to cardiac function, so I focus on the documents describing Cardiovascular-related topics. Pulse Wave Velocity highlights changes in arterial compliance due to hypertension, but it does not directly apply to this patient's situation. The most likely diagnosis is therefore related to Cardiac dysfunction.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
