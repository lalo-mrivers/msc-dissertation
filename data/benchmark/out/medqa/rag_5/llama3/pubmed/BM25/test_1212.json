The literature suggests that vitamin D intake does not affect stone formation (Renal stones and coronary heart disease). However, it is also known that sodium-potassium citrate can inhibit calcium oxalate crystal growth on to kidney stone fragments obtained from extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (Inhibition by sodium-potassium citrate of calcium oxalate crystal growth on to kidney stone fragments obtained from extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy).

The patient's primary physician should recommend the use of sodium-potassium citrate or a similar medication to help prevent future stone formation.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
