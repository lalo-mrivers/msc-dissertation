["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is diagnosed with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) and presents with symptoms of nausea, vomiting, fatigue, and muscle cramps. His laboratory studies show a leukocyte count of 16,000/mm3, hemoglobin level of 13.4 g/dL, and platelet count of 180,000/mm3. The patient has a history of diet-controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus and is a smoker with a history of using marijuana.\n\nThe key symptom to focus on is the muscle cramps, which are likely related to hyperuricemia (high uric acid levels) due to the patient's AML. This is supported by the elevated uric acid level of 11.2 mg/dL.\n\nIn this scenario, allopurinol would be the most effective treatment for preventing the patient's current symptoms. Allopurinol is a xanthine oxidase inhibitor that reduces the production of uric acid and can help alleviate hyperuricemia-related symptoms such as muscle cramps.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
