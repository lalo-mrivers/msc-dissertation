["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided, we know that the patient is being treated for prostate cancer with an experimental drug (drug X) that blocks the androgen receptor. This suggests that the drug is an anti-androgen agent. We also know that the patient has no significant complaints except for excessive sweating at times, and a small area of tissue around his nipples is enlarged bilaterally. This could be related to gynecomastia, which is a common side effect of anti-androgen therapy. Therefore, we can infer that drug X is likely an anti-androgen agent.\n\nLooking at the potential choices, A: Leuprolide is a GnRH agonist used to treat prostate cancer, but it's not an androgen receptor blocker like drug X. B: Finasteride is a 5-alpha-reductase inhibitor used to treat BPH, but it's not an anti-androgen agent like drug X. C: Flutamide is an androgen receptor antagonist used to treat prostate cancer, which makes it the most likely candidate to belong to the same class as drug X.\n\nD: Anastrozole is an aromatase inhibitor used to treat breast cancer, but it's not related to anti-androgen therapy like drug X. Therefore, based on the information provided and the potential choices, the answer is C: Flutamide.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
