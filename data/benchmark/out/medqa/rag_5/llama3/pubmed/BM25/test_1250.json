["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's CD4 count has decreased and viral load has increased despite ongoing treatment. This suggests that the current regimen is not effective. The new drug being considered acts by preventing viral DNA synthesis without undergoing intracellular phosphorylation. Based on this information, I think step-by-step: First, antiretroviral drugs can induce immunologic improvement in patients with HIV infection, but improvements are often partial and transient. Second, the relationship between CD4 count and mortality risk indicator is important to understand. Third, biological markers for determining progression of HIV infection are crucial for health care decisions. Fourth, rifampin does not block early steps in MVL51 infection, but decreases total amount of parental viral DNA taken up. Fifth, CD4 antibody M-T413 inhibits cellular infection with human immunodeficiency virus after viral attachment to the cell membrane.\n\nBased on these considerations, I think that the most likely drug is one that prevents viral DNA synthesis without undergoing intracellular phosphorylation, such as lamivudine.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: Lamivudine\""]
