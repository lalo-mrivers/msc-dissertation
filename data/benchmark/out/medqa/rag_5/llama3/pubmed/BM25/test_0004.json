["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has itchy, watery eyes and sneezing multiple times a day. He had a similar episode 1 year ago around springtime, which suggests that this is likely an allergic reaction. The patient's iron deficiency anemia and ankylosing spondylitis are not directly related to his symptoms. His current medications include ferrous sulfate, artificial tear drops, and indomethacin, but none of these medications would typically be used to treat the symptoms he is experiencing.\n\nThe conjunctival injection with watery discharge suggests that the patient's eyes are inflamed, which is consistent with an allergic reaction. The pupils being 3 mm, equal, and reactive to light rule out any significant ocular problems.\n\nGiven the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, the most appropriate treatment would be to prescribe an antihistamine or a mast cell stabilizer to help alleviate his symptoms.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
