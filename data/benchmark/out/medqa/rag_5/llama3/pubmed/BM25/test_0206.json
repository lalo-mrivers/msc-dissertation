["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Since the researchers are studying the inheritance pattern of mutations in the CFTR gene, we need to focus on the concepts related to genetic linkage. Linkage is the tendency for two or more genes to be inherited together due to their physical proximity on the same chromosome. A LOD score measures the logarithm of the odds that two loci are linked versus unlinked. A higher LOD score indicates a stronger evidence for linkage. In this case, we are looking for which option most likely suggests that the two loci have a high probability of being closely linked. This means we want to choose the option with the highest LOD score.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C: LOD Score > 3\"\n}"]
