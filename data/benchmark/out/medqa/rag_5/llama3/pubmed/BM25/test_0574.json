["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe changes in glomerular polyanions and ultrastructure induced by protamine in rats. An ultrastructural study of the mechanisms of proteinuria in aminonucleoside nephrosis also describes loss of epithelial foot processes and their replacement by flattened expanses of epithelial cytoplasm. This suggests that the patient may have experienced a loss of polyanions in his glomerular basement membranes, leading to pitting edema and proteinuria. Therefore, I would look for findings that support this diagnosis.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
