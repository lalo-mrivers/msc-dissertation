["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with bilateral pitting pedal and ankle edema, fatigue, and shortness of breath on exertion. The ECG shows a right bundle branch block. The cardiac examination reveals a widely split S2 that varies with respiration. This suggests that the patient may have a cardiogenic cause for their edema.

The etiology is most likely related to increased capillary hydrostatic pressure or decreased plasma oncotic pressure due to cardiac disease.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
