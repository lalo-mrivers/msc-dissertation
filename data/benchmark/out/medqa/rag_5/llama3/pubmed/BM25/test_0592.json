["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has a history of intravenous heroin use, which is associated with hepatitis C viral infection. The therapy initiated for the patient includes interferon-α. Interferon-α is an antiviral agent that works by inhibiting protein synthesis in infected cells. It's likely that the additional drug being used to enhance the effect of interferon-α is ribavirin, which inhibits the enzyme Dihydroorotate dehydrogenase. This enzyme plays a crucial role in the pyrimidine biosynthetic pathway and its inhibition can help to boost the antiviral effects of interferon-α.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
