["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with symptoms of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism. The physical examination shows a tender and mildly swollen left lower leg; dorsiflexion of the left foot causes severe pain in the calf, which is indicative of DVT. The laboratory studies show elevated platelet count, prolonged prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), and positive fibrin split products, which are consistent with a diagnosis of DVT.\n\nThe patient's family history of pulmonary embolism suggests that there may be a genetic predisposition to venous thromboembolic disease.
