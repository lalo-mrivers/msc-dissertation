["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is an 8-year-old girl with a 2-day history of hematuria. Two weeks ago, she had a sore throat that resolved without treatment. The physical examination shows 1+ pitting edema of the lower legs and ankles. Urinalysis shows numerous RBCs and 3+ proteinuria. Her antistreptolysin O titer is elevated. Given these symptoms, it is likely that she has acute post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis. Acute post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis is a condition where the immune system's overreaction to streptococcus infection causes inflammation in the kidneys. The formation of antigen-antibody complexes is likely involved in the underlying mechanism of this patient's symptoms.\n\nThe antigen-specific IgE binding to mast cells, tissue-specific antibodies, and presensitized CD8+ cytotoxic T-cells are not directly related to the pathophysiology of acute post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"]
