["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has transmural myocardial infarction in the posterior 1/3 of the ventricular septum. This suggests that the occlusion is most likely to be in the posterior or inferoposterior region of the left ventricle.

Therefore, the most likely location of occlusion is the left circumflex coronary artery.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
