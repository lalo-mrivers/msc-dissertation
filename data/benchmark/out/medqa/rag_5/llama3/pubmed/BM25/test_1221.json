["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, we can infer that the patient has a history of recurrent idiopathic calcium urolithiasis (RCU) with calcium oxalate dihydrate crystals. The 'folded envelope' appearance of the crystals is consistent with calcium oxalate monohydrate or dihydrate crystals. Since the patient has a history of RCU, we can expect to see an association between crystalluria and stone composition. According to the document 'Crystalluria in idiopathic recurrent calcium urolithiasis', calcium oxalate crystalluria is absent from RCU with pure calcium oxalate stones. Therefore, we can infer that the patient's stone composition is likely to be mixed, containing both calcium oxalate and calcium phosphate.\", \"answer_choice\": B}"]
