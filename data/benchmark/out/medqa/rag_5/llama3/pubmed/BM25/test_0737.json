["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is experiencing irregularly irregular heart rhythm, which suggests atrial fibrillation. The patient's heart rate drops to 85/min after receiving IV digoxin, suggesting that digoxin may be having a slowing effect on the heart rate. According to the documents, digoxin increases myocardial contractility in vitro and has a modest but durable beneficial effect in congestive heart failure due to impaired left ventricular systolic function. However, it also tends to slow down the heart rate in patients with atrial fibrillation. Therefore, the most likely explanation for the effect of digoxin in this patient is C: Vagal stimulation.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
