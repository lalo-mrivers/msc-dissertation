["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is experiencing frequent episodes of chest pain and GERD symptoms despite being on cimetidine. The physical examination shows a healthy male with unremarkable findings. This suggests that the new medication prescribed is likely to be an antacid or a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) to control the patient's symptoms. PPIs work by irreversibly inhibiting H+/K+-ATPase at parietal cells, thereby reducing gastric acid secretion. Cimetidine, on the other hand, works by competitively blocking histamine receptors and is not as effective in controlling GERD symptoms. Therefore, the most likely mechanism of action for the new medication is B: Irreversible inhibition of H+/K+-ATPase at parietal cells.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
