["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks to calculate the loading dose of heparin for a 35-year-old man who weighs 50-kg (110-lb) with suspected pulmonary embolism. The volume of distribution of heparin is equivalent to 60 mL/kg, and the target peak plasma concentration is 0.5 units/mL.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the total dose of heparin required. This can be done by multiplying the weight of the patient in kg with the volume of distribution:\n\nTotal dose = Weight (kg) x Volume of distribution (mL/kg)\n= 50 kg x 60 mL/kg\n= 3,000 mL\n\nNext, we need to calculate the loading dose. This can be done by dividing the total dose by the desired peak plasma concentration:\n\nLoading dose = Total dose / Peak plasma concentration\n= 3,000 mL / 0.5 units/mL\n= 6,000 units\n\nSince the patient weighs 50-kg and the target peak plasma concentration is 0.5 units/mL, a loading dose of 6,000 units of heparin would be the most appropriate.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
