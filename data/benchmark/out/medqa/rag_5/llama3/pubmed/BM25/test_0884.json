["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the location of the ribosome in protein-secreting cells. The relevant documents describe various locations where ribosomes can be found, including rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER), smooth endoplasmic reticulum (SER), and cytosol. However, since protein-secreting cells are involved in synthesis of new proteins that will be secreted outside the cell, it is likely that the ribosomes are located in a region where these proteins can be properly processed and transported to their final destination. The document discussing the role of temperature in crystallization of ribosomes in chick embryos does not provide direct relevance to this question. However, the other documents describe various aspects of ribosome function and structure, but do not specifically address the location of ribosomes in protein-secreting cells.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
