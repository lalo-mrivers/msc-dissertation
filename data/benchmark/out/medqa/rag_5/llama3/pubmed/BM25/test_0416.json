The reason behind these infections is likely due to a defect in the innate immune system. Considering Anna Rose's story about her childhood sexual abuse, it seems unrelated to this patient's condition. Ana√Øs Nin's story about self-injury doesn't seem relevant either. The case of Mrs. A.B.'s euthanasia request also doesn't appear to be related. On the psychology of aging women, depression in late mid-life may not be directly linked to this patient's infection. However, it is worth noting that the patient's use of safe sex practices suggests a history of sexual abuse or trauma, which could be connected to her infection.
