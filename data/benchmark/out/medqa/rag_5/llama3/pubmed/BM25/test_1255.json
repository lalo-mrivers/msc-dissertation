["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with sudden-onset pain and loss of vision in her left eye. Given her history of SLE, I would first consider the possibility of anterior uveitis as a cause of her symptoms. The absence of vision response to light in her left eye suggests that there may be optic nerve damage or inflammation involved.\n\nNext, I would examine her right eye to see if it is also affected by the same condition. Since she has normal visual acuity and pupillary reaction in her right eye, I would expect a normal response when shining a light in this eye.\n\nConsidering the clinical scenario and the patient's history of SLE, I would infer that the optic neuropathy is likely related to the autoimmune disorder rather than radiation-induced damage (as suggested by the previous case report). Therefore, my diagnosis would be anterior uveitis or panuveitis secondary to SLE.\", \n\"answer_choice\": \"B: Miosis of the right eye only\""]
