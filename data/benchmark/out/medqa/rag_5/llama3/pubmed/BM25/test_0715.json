["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about a mother bringing her 6-year-old daughter to the pediatrician due to sleeping troubles. The child has been having episodes where she starts screaming and crying in the middle of the night, lasts for approximately 20 minutes, and then goes back to sleeping comfortably without any recollection of the event the next morning. Considering the age of the child, it's unlikely that the episodes are related to child abuse or later development of a mood disorder. The fact that the child has no recollection of the events suggests that they may be associated with nightmares or sleep terrors.
