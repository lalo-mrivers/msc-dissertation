["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about a 78-year-old woman who has just been diagnosed with pancreatic adenocarcinoma. The patient's daughter requests that the doctor does not share the results of the biopsy with the patient, but instead shares them with her and her brother, the patient's health care proxy. This creates an ethical dilemma for the doctor.\n\nThe relevant documents provided discuss confidentiality, self-care, depression, and factitious illness. However, they do not provide a direct answer to this specific question.\n\nTo think step-by-step, I would first consider the patient's autonomy and the right to know their own diagnosis. I would then consider the patient's daughter's request and the reason behind it. I would also consider the role of the health care proxy in making decisions on behalf of the patient.\n\nBased on these considerations, I would conclude that the best response to the patient's daughter's request is not to reveal the results of the biopsy without the patient's consent. This decision respects the patient's autonomy and the right to know their own diagnosis. It also acknowledges the role of the health care proxy in making decisions on behalf of the patient.\n\nTherefore, I would choose option D: Tell the patient's daughter that the patient must be informed of the diagnosis.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
