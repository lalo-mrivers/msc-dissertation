["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is an 8-year-old girl with respiratory distress, facial edema, and a skin rash after eating a buffet dinner. She has a history of mild allergies, a severe peanut allergy, and asthma. Her vital signs include blood pressure 112/87 mm Hg, heart rate 111/min, respiratory rate 25/min, and temperature 37.2°C (99.0°F). The patient has severe edema over her face and an audible stridor in both lungs. Given these symptoms and the patient's history of a peanut allergy, it is likely that the patient has suffered from an allergic reaction. The most important maneuvers for primary treatment of respiratory emergencies in childhood are securing free airways, providing oxygen, and tranquilizing the child medicamentously. Aspiration of foreign bodies is another possible cause of acute, life-threatening respiratory distress. Treatment requires a systematic examination to achieve temporary improvement until more extensive measures can be performed in the hospital.\", \"answer_choice\": B}"]
