["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the resistance to blood flow in a vessel with an occlusion that has caused a 50% reduction in diameter. According to the simple model of hemodynamic effects of a proximal coronary artery narrowing, a lesion causing a 40-50% obstruction would cause maximum flow obtainable for increased myocardial oxygen demand to begin falling significantly. This means that resistance to blood flow would increase. Since the question asks about a 50% reduction in diameter, it is likely referring to this type of occlusion. Therefore, we can assume that the resistance to blood flow has increased by a factor greater than 4 (since a 25% obstruction would only result in an 8-fold increase in resistance). A more significant reduction in diameter would likely result in a higher increase in resistance.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A: 64\""]
