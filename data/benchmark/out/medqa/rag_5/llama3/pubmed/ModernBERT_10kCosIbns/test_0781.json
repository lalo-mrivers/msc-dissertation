["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the detection of HIF-1a in renal cell carcinoma under normoxic conditions. HIF-1a is a transcription factor that is degraded by VHL protein under normoxia. Since RCC can mimic hypoxia, it's likely that HIF-1a will not be degraded and will remain present. A Northern blot detects RNA expression, while Western blot detects protein levels. Based on this information, the most logical conclusion is that a Western blot will show increased HIF-1Î± compared to a normoxic control.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
