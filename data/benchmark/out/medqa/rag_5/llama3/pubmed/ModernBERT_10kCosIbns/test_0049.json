["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the regeneration of alveolar lining after damage to alveoli occurs. The relevant document is 'Surfactant replacement therapy improves pulmonary mechanics in end-stage influenza A pneumonia in mice.' It suggests that surfactant replacement therapy can improve lung function, which implies that the process involved in the regeneration of alveolar lining might be related to surfactant secretion. Another relevant document is 'Pulmonary mechanics after uncomplicated influenza A infection' which mentions that frequency dependence of RT indicates uneven time constants in airways, which could account for mechanical dysfunction of the lungs.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
