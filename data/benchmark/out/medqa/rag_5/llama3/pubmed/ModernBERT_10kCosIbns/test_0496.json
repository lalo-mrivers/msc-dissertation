["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's laboratory studies show a normal sodium level (148 mEq/L), which does not indicate hypernatremia. However, the patient is experiencing symptoms such as agitation, confusion, lethargy, recurring headaches and visual impairment, which could be related to electrolyte imbalances. Upon reviewing the provided documents, I found that hypernatremia is characterized by an increased osmolar content of both extracellular and intracellular compartments, leading to anatomopathological lesions and clinical symptoms. Given the patient's symptoms and laboratory findings, I suspect that there may be another underlying condition contributing to their symptoms rather than primary hypernatremia.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
