["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking which option would suggest that the two loci (ΔF508 mutation and novel mutation) have a high probability of being closely linked. The relevant information from the provided documents is about the association between the ΔF508 mutation and various DNA polymorphisms, such as KM19/PstI and Met H/TaqI. From these associations, we can infer that when the ΔF508 mutation is present, it is often associated with a specific allele of one of these polymorphisms (e.g., the 6.6 kb allele of KM19/PstI). This suggests that the two loci are closely linked.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
