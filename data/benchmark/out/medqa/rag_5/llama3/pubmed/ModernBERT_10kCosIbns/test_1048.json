["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 32-year-old pregnant woman at her 29th week of gestation. She has flu-like symptoms, including fever, runny nose, mild headache, and achy body. Considering the patient's symptoms and the time in pregnancy, it is likely that she has an acute respiratory infection or diarrheal disease, which are common maternal infections during the last months of pregnancy. As a result, her newborn may be at risk for developing neonatal morbidity. Given that breast-feeding had a protective effect against illness in the study, I will consider this factor as well. However, since the patient is not experiencing symptoms suggestive of urinary tract infection or vaginal infection, I will focus on other potential risks.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
