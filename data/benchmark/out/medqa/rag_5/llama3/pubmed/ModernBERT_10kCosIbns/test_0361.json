["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 6-day-old male newborn with increasing irritability and restlessness over the past 2 days. He has had frequent bowel movements and feeds frequently. His mother has Graves' disease, received propylthiouracil during pregnancy, and has a history of intravenous heroin use. The patient has a firm neck swelling and mild diaphoresis. Considering the clinical presentation and maternal history, I will focus on potential effects of the propylthiouracil and other factors on the newborn's thyroid status and respiratory function. Based on the literature, Pethidine (+ Levallorphane) given to mothers shortly before birth may be related to unexpected fatal apneic spells in newborn infants. Additionally, there is a risk of side effects from drugs administered to expectant mothers being seen later in their infants. The patient's respiratory rate of 50/min and mild diaphoresis suggest potential respiratory distress. Therefore, I will consider the possibility of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) or apnea due to the maternal use of propylthiouracil and Pethidine. Given this information, it is essential to monitor the patient's oxygenation levels and perform further evaluation for RDS.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
