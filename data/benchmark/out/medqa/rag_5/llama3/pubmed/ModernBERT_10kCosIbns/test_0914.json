["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the rigidity observed on the body. The first thing to consider is the time frame given: 2 hours after being bitten by a coral snake until his body was discovered 7 hours later. This suggests that the body has undergone some changes due to death and rigor mortis. Coral snakes are venomous, but they do not cause immediate respiratory failure. Therefore, we can rule out neurotoxins as a cause of muscle contraction. The temperature at which the body was found is given as cold, which rules out low temperature affecting muscle proteins. Now, let's look at the options: option C talks about cross-bridge cycling, but rigor mortis is not directly related to this process. Option D also doesn't seem relevant. This leaves us with B, the effect of low temperature on muscle proteins.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
