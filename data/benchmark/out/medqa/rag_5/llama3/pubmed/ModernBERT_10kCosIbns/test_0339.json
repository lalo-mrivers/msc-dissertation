["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms are consistent with a phobic response to spiders. The patient has a history of conditioning experience (i.e., the trauma of discovering the spider nest), which is supported by the fact that she began screaming and ran out of the house upon seeing the spiders. This is also reflected in her inability to enter the house due to fear of more spiders. Given this, it is likely that the patient's phobia is a result of conditioning experiences rather than modeling or informational learning.\n\nThe study on pathways to spider phobia suggests that conditioning events do not necessarily give rise to phobic fears, but the present case is different as it involves a traumatic event for the patient. Therefore, desensitization, which involves exposure to the feared stimulus in a controlled and gradual manner, may be an effective treatment.\n\nDesensitization has been shown to be effective in treating specific phobias including arachnophobia. The study on defensive responses to phobic stimuli suggests that physiological recordings can be used to monitor the patient's response during exposure therapy. This can help tailor the exposure therapy to the individual's needs and optimize treatment outcomes.\n\nThe other options do not seem relevant or effective for this case. Metoprolol is a beta blocker that may be used to treat anxiety symptoms, but it does not address the underlying phobia. Alprazolam is an anxiolytic medication that can help reduce anxiety symptoms, but it does not target the specific phobic response. Psychotherapy may be useful in addressing other issues, but it does not specifically address arachnophobia.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
