["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the mechanism of action of a weight-loss medication that is likely to cause greasy diarrhea, excessive belching, and flatulence. The symptoms suggest an increase in gut motility or fat malabsorption. The patient also complains of worsening night-time vision, which may be related to changes in hormone levels.\n\nThe provided documents do not explicitly mention the medication used in this case study. However, we can look for clues from the documents about the types of medications that were effective in weight loss.\n\nFrom the 'A review of obesity and its management in 263 cases' document, we see that D-Phendimetrazine bitartrate was an excellent anorexiant for routine use, while Fenfluramine was used as a valuable adjuvant drug for refractory cases. Both medications are appetite suppressants.\n\nFrom the 'Hormonal, metabolic and cardiovascular response to the duration of a combined slimming regimen' document, we see that the study measured various hormone levels before and after a 12-day weight-loss regimen. The results showed statistically significant decreases in serum insulin, growth hormone, triiodothyronine, and cholesterol.\n\nGiven these clues, it is likely that the medication the patient is taking is an appetite suppressant that works by stimulating norepinephrine release.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
