["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with respiratory distress and crackles on physical examination. He does not respond to mechanical ventilation and 100% oxygen, and ultimately dies due to respiratory insufficiency. Autopsy reveals heavy, red lungs. Histology is shown in Image A. The description of the autopsy findings suggests that the patient had Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). This is supported by the fact that he did not respond to mechanical ventilation and 100% oxygen. ARDS is a condition characterized by inflammation and injury to the alveolar-capillary membrane, leading to increased permeability and edema. The 'red' lungs are consistent with this finding.\n\nThe patient's age (58 years) is also relevant. While it is possible for younger patients to develop ARDS, it is more common in older adults, particularly those with significant underlying disease or trauma.\n\nGiven these findings, the most likely diagnosis is Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). The histology shown in Image A would be consistent with this finding, showing diffuse alveolar damage and inflammation. This would also explain the patient's lack of response to mechanical ventilation and 100% oxygen.\n\nThe other options are less likely:\n\n* Diaphragmatic hypertrophy is not a cause of respiratory distress or ARDS.\n* Interstitial edema could contribute to respiratory distress, but it is not a primary cause of ARDS.\n* Large pulmonary embolus could cause respiratory distress, but the patient's lack of response to mechanical ventilation and 100% oxygen suggests that this is less likely. Additionally, an embolus would not typically cause 'red' lungs.\n\nGiven these findings, option B (Interstitial edema) is the most plausible diagnosis.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
