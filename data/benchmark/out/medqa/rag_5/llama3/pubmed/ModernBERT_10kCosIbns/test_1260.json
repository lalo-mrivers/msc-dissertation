["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the mechanism of action of a drug prescribed for a patient with Parkinson's disease. The patient has been diagnosed with Parkinson's disease 4 months ago and treatment was initiated. Based on the patient's symptoms, it is likely that the patient is taking selegiline, which is an MAO-B inhibitor. This is because the patient's wife reports that the patient becomes restless and irritable when his gambling habits are restricted, which could be a sign of increased dopamine levels due to decreased MAO-B activity. Therefore, the most likely drug prescribed for this patient is selegiline.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C: Selective inhibition of monoamine oxidase B\""]
