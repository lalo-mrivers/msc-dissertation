["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with shoulder pain and weakness after helping his son move. He initially thought the pain was due to being out of shape but symptoms worsened with weightlifting. The physical exam reveals prominent weakness in external rotation, 1/5 strength for abduction, and the patient dropping their arm when lowering it from overhead. This suggests a shoulder instability issue, possibly related to subluxation. Given the patient's age and previous medical history, spinal cord injury or stroke can be ruled out. The most likely etiology of this patient's symptoms is shoulder instability due to trauma (helping his son move) or recurrent anterior subluxation.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
