["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is an 18-month-old girl with vaginal bleeding. The mother denies trauma, frequent nosebleeds or easy bruising. Physical exam shows multiple hyperpigmented patches on the trunk, bilateral breast enlargement without pubic hair. A radiograph of the left lower leg shows patchy lytic bone and sclerosis in the femoral metaphysis. Given these findings, the most likely diagnosis is likely to be related to precocious puberty or a local lesion. The patient's age and physical exam findings suggest that this is not a case of physiologic vaginal bleeding in newborns. Precocious puberty could be a possibility but the mother's report of limb pain and abnormal radiograph findings suggest a more localized cause.\", \"answer_choice\": D}"]
