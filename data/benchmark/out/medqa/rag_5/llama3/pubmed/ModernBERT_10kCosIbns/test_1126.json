["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has a massive intracranial bleed and is unresponsive. Given the presence of an intracranial bleed, it's likely that the brain injury is severe and may have caused irreversible damage to the brain. The clinical findings suggest apnea (unresponsiveness to noxious stimuli), absent pupillary response, and absent corneal reflex. Based on these findings, the diagnosis of brain death is possible. In this situation, electroencephalography (EEG) would be the most appropriate next step in diagnosing brain death.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
