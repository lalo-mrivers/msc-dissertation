["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with double vision (diplopia) which can be caused by various conditions. The history of type I diabetes mellitus and recent hemoglobin A1c level of 7.4% suggest that the patient's underlying condition may be related to her visual symptoms. Additionally, her family history of Sjogren's syndrome and carotid dissection suggests a possible autoimmune or vascular component. Given these factors, it is likely that the patient's diplopia is caused by an optical problem rather than a neurological one.
