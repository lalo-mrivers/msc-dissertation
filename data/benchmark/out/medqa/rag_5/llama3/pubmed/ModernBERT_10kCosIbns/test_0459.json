["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with severe right hip and knee pain. The pain is non-radiating, sharp, and aching in character, and is localized to the right hip and knee joints. The physical examination reveals limited range of motion in the right hip, with strength being 4 out of 5 at the right hip joint and 5 out of 5 elsewhere. The laboratory tests are unremarkable. The plain radiographs of the right hip joint show displacement of the right femoral head inferoposterior off the femoral neck. Given these findings, it is likely that the patient has a slipped upper femoral epiphysis (SUF), which is a common condition in adolescents. SUF is characterized by the gradual slippage of the capital femoral epiphysis away from its metaphyseal junction.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
