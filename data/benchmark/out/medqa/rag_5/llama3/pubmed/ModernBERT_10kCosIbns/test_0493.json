["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the effects of aerosol ipratropium bromide and salbutamol on exercise tolerance in chronic bronchitis. The boy has asthma and presents with shortness of breath after prolonged exposure to cold air. He declines nebulized albuterol due to a history of palpitations and the physician prescribes nebulized ipratropium bromide, which results in significant clinical improvement. This suggests that ipratropium bromide is effective in improving lung function in asthma patients, particularly those who may not respond well to beta-agonists like albuterol. In comparison studies, ipratropium bromide and salbutamol have similar effects on forced expiratory volume and vital capacity, but salbutamol has a greater effect on 12-minute walking distance. The dose-effect study suggests that high doses of ipratropium bromide do not cause significant changes in hemodynamic parameters or blood gases.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
