["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The problem is to calculate the number needed to treat (NNT) for the primary endpoint of death from cardiac causes. The p-value is 0.03 which indicates that medication 1 has a statistically significant effect compared to medication 2. To calculate NNT, we need to know the absolute risk reduction (ARR). Since the study reported an outcome rate, we can estimate ARR as follows: ARR = Risk of death from cardiac causes in Medication 2 - Risk of death from cardiac causes in Medication 1. From the data, we get ARR = 210/1500 - 134/1500 = 76/1500. Now we need to calculate the relative risk reduction (RRR). Since the p-value is 0.03, it's reasonable to assume that RRR is close to 100%. Therefore, RRR ≈ 1. Then we can estimate ARR as follows: ARR = RRR * Base Rate, where base rate is the risk of death from cardiac causes in Medication 2. Plug in the values: ARR ≈ 1 * (210/1500) = 76/1500. Now we can calculate NNT using the formula: NNT = 1 / ARR. NNT ≈ 1/(76/1500) ≈ 16.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
