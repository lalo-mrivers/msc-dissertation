The inspiratory crackles over the lung bases on physical examination indicate a possible interstitial lung disease or chronic bronchitis. Given the patient's history of idiopathic arrhythmia and taking amiodarone daily, we should consider the effects of this medication on pulmonary function tests. Spirometry is a useful tool in office practice to distinguish among different types of ventilatory impairment and detect small-airway disease at an early stage.\n\nThe combination of inspiratory crackles and cough for 3 months suggests chronic bronchitis as a possible diagnosis. Chronic bronchitis often presents with decreased FEV1 (forced expiratory volume in one second) and FVC (forced vital capacity), which would affect the ratio of FEV1/FVC.\n\nGiven these findings, we should expect the spirometry to show...\",\n\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
