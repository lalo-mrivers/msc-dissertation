["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for the patient's most likely DEXA scan result. We know that the patient has osteopenia. According to the relevant documents, osteopenia corresponds to an abnormally low bone density. It is accompanied by an increased risk of fractures. Although it remains asymptomatic, therapeutic intervention may nevertheless be justified.\n\nWe can look at the document '[Evaluation of osteodensitometry]' which defines normal curves for DEXA measurements. According to this document, a T-score of -1 or less indicates osteoporosis, while a T-score between -1 and -2.5 indicates osteopenia.\n\nGiven that the patient has osteopenia, we can infer that her T-score is likely to be around -1 to -2.5.\n\nWe also know that the patient's mother had osteoporosis, which may indicate a family history of osteoporosis.\n\nHowever, we do not have enough information to determine the patient's exact DEXA scan result. We can only provide a possible range for her T-score based on the definition of osteopenia in the relevant document.\", \n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
