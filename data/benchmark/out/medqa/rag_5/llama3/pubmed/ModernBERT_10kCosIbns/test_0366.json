["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 28-year-old female with episodic chest pain described as squeezing and tightness. The pain has been happening every few days for 3 months. She reports no association with food or exercise, but can climb up to her fourth-floor apartment daily without issue.
