["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks to recommend an aldosterone receptor antagonist for a 62-year-old man with hypertension despite multiple medication use. The patient is concerned about side effects like impotence and gynecomastia. After reviewing the relevant documents, I found that spironolactone is a competitive aldosterone antagonist with marked anti-aldosterone activity. It is also mentioned in another document as a beta-blocker with similar efficacy to sympathetic inhibitory drugs and methyldopa.

Therefore, I will choose an alternative aldosterone receptor antagonist that does not have these specific side effects.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
