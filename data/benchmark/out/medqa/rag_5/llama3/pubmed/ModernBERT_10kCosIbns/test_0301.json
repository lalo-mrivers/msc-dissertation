["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the embryological structure from which the tissue is derived. The patient has a left-sided abdominal mass on the kidney, and histological examination shows primitive blastemal cells and immature tubules and glomeruli. This suggests that the tumor is of renal origin. Wilms' tumors are a type of pediatric kidney cancer that typically occur in children under 5 years old.
