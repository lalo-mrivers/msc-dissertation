["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the increased expiratory flow rate. The patient has chronic lung disease, which suggests COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease). In the study 'Effect of pulmonary hygiene measures on levels of arterial oxygen saturation in adults with chronic lung disease', it is mentioned that subjects with moderate-to-severe COPD showed no clinically significant changes in SaO2 levels during pulmonary hygiene measures. This information does not directly relate to expiratory flow rate, but it gives an idea about the patient's condition. The other studies mentioned do not seem to be directly relevant to this question.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
