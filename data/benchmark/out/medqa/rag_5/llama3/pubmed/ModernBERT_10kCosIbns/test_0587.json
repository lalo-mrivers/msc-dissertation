["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about a 33-year-old G2P1 woman with poor diabetic control and a family history that is non-contributory. She's currently at 18 weeks gestation and has had an abdominal ultrasound ordered. We're looking for the most likely congenital abnormality shown on the ultrasound.\n\nFrom the relevant documents, we know that in previous pregnancies of women with gestational diabetes, the incidence of congenital abnormalities was 13.6%. This suggests that there may be a higher risk of congenital abnormalities in this patient population.\n\nGiven that the patient has type 1 diabetes and not gestational diabetes, it's unlikely that the congenital abnormality would be related to gestational diabetes. However, we do know that women with type 1 diabetes are at increased risk for certain congenital abnormalities, including cardiac defects.\n\nBased on this information, we can infer that the most likely congenital abnormality shown on the ultrasound is a cardiac defect.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
