["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has severe chest pain, shock from a recent loss, and physical examination findings of an S3 heart sound and rales in the lower lung lobes. The ECG shows no significant findings. Considering the possibility of life-threatening causes of acute chest pain, such as myocardial infarction, dissecting aneurysm, and pulmonary embolism, it is important to consider the cause as 'myocardial infarction until proved otherwise'. However, given the patient's recent loss and the lack of significant ECG findings, another diagnosis should be considered.

Based on this information, the most likely diagnosis is not an arrhythmia or pericarditis, but rather a cardiomyopathy.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: Restrictive cardiomyopathy\"\n}"]
