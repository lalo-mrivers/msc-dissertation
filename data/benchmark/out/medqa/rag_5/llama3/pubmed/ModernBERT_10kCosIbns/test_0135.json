["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the primary function of a protein bound to CD8. Based on the provided documents, it can be seen that CD8 binds to MHC class I molecules and also has adhesion properties. The study mentioned in document 1 shows that CD8 can bind to HLA-G, a nonclassical MHC class I molecule expressed by cytotrophoblast cells. This suggests that the protein bound to CD8 may be an MHC class I molecule. Document 2 further supports this idea as it shows that human CD8 can interact with the alpha 3 domain of murine class I molecules, indicating that CD8 can bind to different MHC class I molecules.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
