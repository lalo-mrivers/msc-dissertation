["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 65-year-old man with HIV infection who presents with painless swelling of the neck, intermittent fevers, and severe night sweats. He has a history of smoking but no alcohol or recreational drug use. The physical examination shows multiple non-tender swollen lymph nodes in the neck, axillary, and inguinal regions. Laboratory studies show anemia, normocytic anemia with elevated LDH levels, and normal kidney function. These findings suggest that the patient likely has HIV-related lymphoma, which is a common complication of HIV infection.\n\nThe next diagnostic step should be to perform a biopsy of the lymph nodes to confirm the diagnosis of lymphoma.
