["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has been taking digoxin for 1 year, and recently verapamil was added to prevent migraine headaches. The patient's serum digoxin level is 3.7 ng/mL, which is above the therapeutic range of 0.8-2 ng/mL. This suggests that the patient may have digitalis toxicity. According to the provided documents, the mean SDC for patients with digitalis-induced arrhythmias was 3.07 ng/ml, compared to 1.02 ng/ml for patients with normal Ecg's and 1.01 ng/ml for patients with rhythm disturbances of other origin. Taking 2.0 ng/ml as the lower limit of digitalis intoxication, a more than 85% coincidence was found between the diagnosis based on serial Ecg's and on SDC levels. No signs of cardiac toxicity were found in patients with SDC's less than 1.6 ng/ml, some patients however showed normal Ecg's despite SDC's up to 4.5 ng/ml.\n\nThe patient's symptoms include nausea, vomiting, palpitations, and dizziness, which are consistent with digitalis toxicity. The electrocardiogram shows paroxysmal atrial tachycardia with block, which is also a symptom of digitalis toxicity.\n\nTherefore, the mechanism most likely explaining the development of digitalis toxicity in this patient is the elevated serum digoxin level, which is above the therapeutic range and consistent with the patient's symptoms and electrocardiogram findings.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
