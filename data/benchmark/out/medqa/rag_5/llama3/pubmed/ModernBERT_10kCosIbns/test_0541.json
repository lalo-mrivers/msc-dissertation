["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The study does not provide direct information about the relationship between young age MI and educational status. However, we can make an inference by comparing our question with the existing literature. One of the studies mentioned that men with little education (eight years of schooling or less) who had complex ventricular premature beats in the monitoring hour had over three times the risk of sudden coronary death found among better educated men with the same arrhythmia. This suggests that low educational status might be a risk factor for MI, especially when combined with other risk factors. Given the computed odds ratio of 2.1 and confidence interval of 0.9-9.7, we can infer that there is some association between low education and the risk of MI.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
