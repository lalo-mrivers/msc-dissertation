["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with intermittent vertigo, vomiting, and complete hearing loss in the left ear. The otoscopy reveals a suppurative, erythematous, bulging tympanic membrane, which is immobile. Pure-tone audiometry testing confirms hearing loss across all frequencies in the left ear. Given the symptoms and physical examination findings, it appears that there is an otologic cause of vertigo. The patient's history of uterine fibroids and use of mifepristone may be relevant, but they do not seem to be directly contributing to the current symptoms. The patient's laboratory results show normal electrolyte levels, which suggests that there is no life-threatening condition present. Based on the presentation and examination findings, the most likely diagnosis is an inner ear disorder, possibly labyrinthitis or otosclerosis, given the presence of hearing loss and immobile tympanic membrane.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
