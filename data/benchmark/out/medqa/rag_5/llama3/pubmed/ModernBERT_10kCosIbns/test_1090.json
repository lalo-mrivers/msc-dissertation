["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the relevant documents, particularly 'Common sexual problems of children and adolescents', it is clear that the physician should be aware of their own sexual attitudes to avoid bias and work with the patient's family. Since the patient is an adolescent, they are likely to have conflicts over sexual identity and may not admit to problems. Considering this, a sensitive and non-judgmental approach is necessary.\n\nGiven the patient's embarrassment and avoidance of eye contact, it is likely that he feels uncomfortable discussing his behavior. Therefore, rather than directly addressing the issue, the most appropriate next step would be to reassure the mother and work with her to develop a trusting relationship with the adolescent.\n\nThe documents also emphasize the importance of considering the child in the context of their family, peers, and own growth and development. In this case, it is crucial to assess the situation further before making any decisions or recommendations.\n\nFurthermore, 'Reaching emotionally disturbed children: 'judo' principles in remedial education' suggests that the often destructive behavior of adolescents may be viewed as potential strength to be channeled. This approach could be helpful in addressing the patient's concerns and developing a plan for his well-being.\n\nIn light of these considerations, it is clear that advising the patient to stop masturbating (A) or prescribing sertraline (D) would not be appropriate without further assessment and discussion with the patient and his mother. Measuring serum testosterone level (B) may also not be relevant in this situation, as there are no indications of any underlying hormonal abnormality.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
