["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is an 18-month-old boy who was born at 37 weeks' gestation and spent one night in the neonatal intensive care unit for respiratory distress. He started walking independently at 12 months but stopped walking and appears weaker than he was a few months ago, with brief convulsive episodes over the past week. The patient has muscle rigidity and diffuse muscle wasting, unable to stand or sit up straight, with absent patellar, Achilles, and brachioradialis reflexes. A urine sample demonstrates metachromic granules.\n\nIn 'Dissociated motor development--developmental patterns, clinical characteristics, causal factors and outcome, with special reference to late walking children', it is mentioned that some patients have muscle wasting and hypotonia. In the same document, it is stated that girls are overrepresented among idiopathic late walkers, and complete normalization was more common in this group.\n\nIn 'Establishing standing and walking behavior in a physically handicapped, retarded child', it is discussed how a physical therapist used an attendant staff to work on target behaviors in a two-and-one-half month treatment program.\n\nFrom these documents, I can conclude that the patient's condition is related to his muscle wasting and hypotonia, which are characteristic features of late walkers. The presence of metachromic granules in the urine sample suggests a lysosomal storage disorder. Considering these findings, I believe that the defect lies in an enzyme responsible for breaking down glycolipids or mucopolysaccharides.\n\nThe patient's clinical presentation and laboratory results are consistent with Fabry disease, which is caused by a deficiency of alpha-galactosidase A. Therefore, I conclude that the patient's condition is caused by a defect in this enzyme.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
