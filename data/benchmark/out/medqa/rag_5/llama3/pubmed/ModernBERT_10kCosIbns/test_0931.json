["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has numbness and burning over both feet, an unsteady gait, and decreased sensation to light touch extending from the soles of the feet to the mid-shin bilaterally. This is likely related to his treatment with an antimycobacterial drug for a positive tuberculin skin test. The symptoms suggest peripheral neuropathy, which is a common side effect of certain medications used to treat tuberculosis. Based on this information, I would eliminate options A and D as they do not relate to the patient's symptoms or medication regimen. Option B could potentially cause similar symptoms, but it is unlikely given the patient's treatment for tuberculosis. Therefore, the most likely cause of this patient's current symptoms is C: Segmental demyelination of peripheral axons.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
