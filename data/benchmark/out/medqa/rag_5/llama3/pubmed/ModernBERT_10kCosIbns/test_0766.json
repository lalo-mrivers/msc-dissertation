["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a healthy 16-year-old female who has not had a menstrual period. She has normal female external genitalia and pubic hair, but an absent uterus on ultrasound. Serum testosterone levels are within the normal range for females. This suggests that the patient may have some degree of masculinization. The absence of a uterus and presence of testosterone at normal female levels points to a karyotype of 46XY.

Therefore, the most likely cause of this patient's condition is D: Failure of paramesonephric duct development.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
