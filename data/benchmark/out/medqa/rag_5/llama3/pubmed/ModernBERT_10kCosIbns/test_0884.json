["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the location of ribosomes that play an important role in protein-secreting cells. We need to look for information about where ribosomes are located and how this relates to protein synthesis and secretion. The documents provided describe the structure and function of ribosomes, but do not explicitly mention the location of ribosomes in different cell types. However, we can infer that the rough endoplasmic reticulum is likely involved based on its role in protein synthesis and secretion.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
