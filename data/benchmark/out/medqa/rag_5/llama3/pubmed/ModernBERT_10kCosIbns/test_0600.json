["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking why capsular polysaccharides are conjugated to protein carriers like tetanus toxoid during vaccine development. The relevant documents mention that T cell-dependent properties are enhanced in conjugates of smaller saccharides, and the conformational epitope of the native polysaccharide may be better expressed in conjugates of larger saccharides. This suggests that conjugation can improve the immunogenicity of capsular polysaccharides. Additionally, the documents mention that IgG antibodies, which are thought to reflect T cell dependence, are more prominent in response to shorter chain length conjugates. This implies that conjugation with a protein carrier can generate an IgG dominant antibody response.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
