["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the events that occur immediately prior to the release of neurotransmitters. Based on the provided documents, we know that glutamate is an excitatory amino acid and its release is believed to be a key factor in delayed neuronal death after transient forebrain ischemia. We also know that NMDA receptor binding showed no change in all brain regions until 10 days after cerebral ischemia, but decreased in the hippocampus to 50% after 21 days. Additionally, inhibition of glutamate release by kynurenic acid did not protect CA1 cells from forebrain ischemia.\n\nFrom these findings, we can infer that the events occurring immediately prior to the release of neurotransmitters are related to the activation of NMDA receptors and the influx of calcium. This is because delayed neuronal death appears to be a result of the prolonged activation of NMDA receptors and the subsequent influx of calcium into presynaptic nerve terminals.\n\nThe correct answer is therefore D: Influx of calcium.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
