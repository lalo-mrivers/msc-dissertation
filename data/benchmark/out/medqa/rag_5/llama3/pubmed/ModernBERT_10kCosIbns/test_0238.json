["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The study explores the relationship between incidence and prevalence rates of SLE. Incident cases are those that occur at the initial diagnosis in the hospital database, while prevalent cases are those that maintain their diagnosis until death. Shorter time periods would capture more incident cases, as patients would not have had as much time to develop SLE or have it diagnosed yet. Longer time periods would capture both new incident cases and existing prevalent cases. This means that incidence rates would be higher in shorter time periods.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
