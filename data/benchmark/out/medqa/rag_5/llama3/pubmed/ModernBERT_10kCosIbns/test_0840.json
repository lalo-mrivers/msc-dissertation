["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The given question describes a delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction. Based on the clinical scenario, a raised, slightly hardened area at the injection site suggests an inflammatory response. Since Candida is injected, it's likely that T cells are involved in the immune response. The presence of germ tubes (observed in most Candida strains) also points towards a cell-mediated response.\n\nType IV hypersensitivity reaction is characterized by delayed onset and involves CD4+ T cells. This type of reaction often leads to granuloma formation, which is consistent with the described clinical presentation.\n\nThe other options can be ruled out: Type I hypersensitivity typically presents as an immediate allergic reaction, and eosinophils are involved in this type of response. Type III hypersensitivity is characterized by immune complex-mediated damage and doesn't fit the described clinical scenario. Mast cells are not directly involved in a delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction.\n\nBased on these findings, the correct answer choice is likely to be related to Type IV hypersensitivity.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
