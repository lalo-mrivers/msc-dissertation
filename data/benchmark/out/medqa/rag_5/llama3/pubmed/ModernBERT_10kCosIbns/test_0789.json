["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has a history of hypertension and is currently being treated for pneumonia. He has no chest pain or dizziness, but he does experience sudden onset of palpitations leading to syncope. Telemetry shows polymorphic ventricular tachycardia with cyclic alteration of the QRS axis. This suggests that the patient's syncope is likely caused by a cardiac arrhythmia. The patient's medications include lisinopril and metformin, which are both commonly used to treat hypertension and diabetes respectively. However, these medications would not typically cause polymorphic ventricular tachycardia. Therefore, we should focus on other possible causes of cardiac arrhythmias such as Brugada syndrome or prolonged QT interval.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
