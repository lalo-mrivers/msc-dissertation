["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is given prophylactic labetalol and magnesium sulfate. Examination shows absent deep tendon reflexes bilaterally. This suggests that the patient has developed muscle relaxation due to the magnesium sulfate. Magnesium can cause neuromuscular blockade, which may lead to absent deep tendon reflexes. Labetalol, a beta blocker, is unlikely to be related to the absent deep tendon reflexes. Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management would be to stop the magnesium sulfate and provide calcium gluconate to counteract the effects of magnesium.\",\n\"answer_choice\": A"]
