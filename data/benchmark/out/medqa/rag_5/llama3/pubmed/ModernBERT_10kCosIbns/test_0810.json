["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's laboratory results show a normal hemoglobin level, but an increased reticulocyte count suggesting hemolysis. The presence of spherocytes on the peripheral blood smear is consistent with autoimmune hemolytic anemia. The Coombs test being negative suggests that the hemolysis is not immune-mediated. Considering the scleral icterus and moderate splenomegaly, cholelithiasis or a biliary obstruction could be contributing to the hemolysis. However, the ultrasound examination would reveal the presence of gallstones or bile duct obstruction. Ultrasonography was found to be accurate in 92.5% of cases in the previous study.
