["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has a connective tissue disorder caused by impaired copper absorption and transport. The question is asking about the gene mutation responsible for this disorder. After reviewing the provided documents, we can see that all of them are related to copper deficiency or its effects on various tissues. In particular, the first document discusses hypomyelination in copper-deficient rats, while the second and third documents describe skeletal changes and abnormalities associated with copper deficiency in humans and animals, respectively. The fourth document describes heart involvement in a different condition, but it does not provide any relevant information about the present case. Therefore, we need to look for a specific mutation that is known to cause impaired copper absorption and transport. This leads us to ATP7B, which is the gene responsible for Menkes syndrome, a rare genetic disorder characterized by impaired copper absorption and transport.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: ATP7B\""]
