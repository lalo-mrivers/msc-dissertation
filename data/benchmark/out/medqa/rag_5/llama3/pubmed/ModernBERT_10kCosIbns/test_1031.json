["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has a painless mass in the left testicle. The tumor markers are elevated, with AFP at 350 ng/mL (normal value < 10 ng/mL) and hCG at 0.4 IU/L (normal value < 0.5 IU/L). The biopsy shows glomeruli-like structures with a central capillary within a mesodermal core, lined by flattened layers of germ cells.
