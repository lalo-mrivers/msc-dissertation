["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's temperature is normal, but his oxygen saturation is low (73%). His arterial blood gas analysis shows a respiratory acidosis with a PCO2 of 33 mm Hg. This suggests that the patient has acute respiratory failure likely due to respiratory depression or hypoxemia. The patient was extubated too soon after surgery and developed respiratory distress. Given this scenario, reintubation is the best next step to provide positive pressure ventilation and improve oxygenation.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
