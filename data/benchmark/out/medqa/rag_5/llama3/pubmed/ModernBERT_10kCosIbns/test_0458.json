["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking which physiological response is most likely responsible for the change in heart rate and blood pressure. Initially, the man's heart rate was 70/min and his blood pressure was 114/74 mm Hg. After stopping his run, his heart rate increased to 130/min and his blood pressure increased to 145/75 mm Hg. This is a common response seen after intense exercise, where there is an increase in sympathetic nervous system activity. The baroreceptor reflex helps regulate blood pressure by adjusting cardiac output and peripheral resistance in response to changes in blood pressure. However, this would not necessarily cause a large increase in heart rate and blood pressure as observed here. Vagal nuclei activation could potentially decrease heart rate but not increase it as seen in this case. Vasopressin release from the pituitary gland is not directly related to heart rate or blood pressure changes after exercise. Therefore, based on the physiological responses observed, the most likely cause of the change in heart rate and blood pressure is sympathetic nervous system activation.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
