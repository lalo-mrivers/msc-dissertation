["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with itchy, watery eyes for the past week, which is a common symptom of allergic conjunctivitis. The fact that he had a similar episode 1 year ago around springtime suggests an allergic cause. His profession as an elementary school teacher also increases the likelihood of allergies. Given his iron deficiency anemia and ankylosing spondylitis, other causes such as conjunctival inflammation or uveitis are less likely.
