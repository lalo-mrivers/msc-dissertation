["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 16-year-old female who has never had a period and is experiencing headaches with photosensitivity and nausea. She has a family history of migraine headaches and bipolar disorder. The laboratory studies show normal electrolytes, renal function, and liver function. The FSH level is elevated, while the estrogen level is normal for her age. The abdominal ultrasound shows a normal uterus and ovaries. Considering these findings, it's likely that the patient has polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), which is characterized by irregular menstrual cycles, insulin resistance, and other hormonal imbalances. However, since the patient has never had a period, PCOS is unlikely. Instead, the most likely diagnosis is delayed menarche due to PCOS or another underlying endocrine disorder.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
