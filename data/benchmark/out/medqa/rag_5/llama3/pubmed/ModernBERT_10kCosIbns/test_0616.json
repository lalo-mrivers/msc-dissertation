["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has fever, chills, and night sweats, which suggests an inflammatory process. The development of proteinuria (4+ protein in urine) shortly after the lymph node biopsy suggests a possible allergic reaction or inflammation in response to the procedure. Given the patient's age and the lack of other symptoms suggesting a specific kidney disease, I would look for findings that suggest an acute inflammatory process.
