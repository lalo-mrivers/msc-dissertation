["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The splenic artery is ligated at its origin from the celiac trunk. The collateral hemodynamics measured during splenic artery occlusion showed that the mean collateral splenic perfusion pressure was 34.3 +/- 9.4 mmHg. This suggests that the short gastric arteries, which are part of the spleno-mesenteric circuit, will supply blood to the spleen. Therefore, the left gastric artery, which is also part of this circuit, will not be hypoperfused.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
