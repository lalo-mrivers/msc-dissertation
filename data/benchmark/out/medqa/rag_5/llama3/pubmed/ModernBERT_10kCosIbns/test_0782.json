["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 25-year-old primigravida admitted to the hospital at 36 weeks gestation after a generalized tonic-clonic seizure. She complains of a headache that started 2 hours prior to the seizure, and her physical examination shows leg and perineal edema. The neurologic examination is significant for symmetric upper and lower extremity hyperreflexia and ankle clonus. These findings are consistent with preeclampsia or eclampsia, which can cause seizures in pregnant women. Therefore, I would expect to see laboratory findings consistent with this diagnosis.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
