["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has a history of coronary artery disease, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. His current medications are aspirin, simvastatin, metformin, and enalapril. He has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 33 years. On arrival, his pulse is 136/min and irregular, respirations are 20/min, and blood pressure is 85/55 mm Hg. The lungs are clear to auscultation. Cardiac examination shows no abnormalities. An ECG is shown.\n\nThe patient's symptoms are severe retrosternal chest pain necessitating from one to seven hospital admissions per patient for 'suspect myocardial infarction'. However, the electrocardiogram and serum enzyme changes did not prove this diagnosis. Abnormal resting electrocardiograms were present in 7 of the 11 patients.\n\nGiven these findings, the most likely cause of his chest pain is esophageal disease rather than coronary artery disease. Therefore, the next step would be to evaluate for esophageal disease, such as hiatus hernia or disordered motored activity of the esophagus, which could reproduce his chest pain.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B: Intravenous esmolol\""]
