["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"After a T cell progenitor leaves the bone marrow, it passes through several stages during its maturation. The question asks when positive selection takes place. According to the documents, thymocytes undergo positive selection, which is dependent upon recognition of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules on thymic stroma. This suggests that this process occurs after the pre-T cell stage, as it requires the presence of MHC molecules. The document also mentions that immature CD4+8+ T cells differentiate into CD4+8- cells in response to antigen and nonthymic antigen-presenting cells, indicating that positive selection likely occurs during the double-positive T cell stage.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
