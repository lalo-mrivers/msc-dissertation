["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has a history of asthma with worsening shortness of breath. She has experienced 4 episodes of pneumonia in the last 3 years and often suffers from \\\"random\\\" bouts of excessive coughing and wheezing. The vital signs show normal blood pressure, pulse rate, respiratory rate, and temperature. On physical exam, the patient appears frail-looking and in moderate respiratory distress with inspiratory crackles in the right lung base and coarse breath sounds in the bilateral upper lung lobes. Chest radiograph reveals atelectasis in the right lung base and \\\"glove-finger shadows\\\" which suggest a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The patient's symptoms, physical exam findings, and chest radiograph are consistent with COPD. Her elevated IgE levels also support this diagnosis. Therefore, the most appropriate therapy is steroids to reduce inflammation in her airways.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: Prednisone\"\n}"]
