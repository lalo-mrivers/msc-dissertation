["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is experiencing episodic neck stiffness and pain that lasts for approximately 25 minutes. During the last episode, he was able to relieve the stiffness by lightly touching his jaw. He has received six doses of haloperidol for auditory hallucinations since his admission. The patient's neck is rigid with limited range of motion. The relevant documents discuss cervical muscle strengthening and exercises in relation to chronic neck pain. However, in this case, the patient's symptoms are acute and episodic, suggesting a different approach is needed. The patient has received haloperidol for auditory hallucinations, which may be related to his neck stiffness and pain. Given the patient's history of substance-induced psychosis, it is possible that his symptoms are exacerbated by anxiety or other psychological factors.\n\nConsidering these factors, it appears that the most appropriate therapy for this patient's symptoms would focus on reducing his anxiety and addressing any potential movement-related exacerbations. Benztropine, a medication used to treat extrapyramidal symptoms such as akathisia and dystonia, may be helpful in managing the patient's neck stiffness and pain.\n\nBenztropine is also commonly used to treat Parkinsonian symptoms, which are sometimes related to anxiety or other psychological factors. Given the patient's history of substance-induced psychosis and his current symptoms, it seems reasonable to consider benztropine as a potential treatment option.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
