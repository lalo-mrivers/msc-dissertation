["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents suggest that splenectomy is associated with an increased risk of infections, particularly in children. The literature highlights the importance of prophylactic antibiotics in preventing infections after splenectomy. In this case, the patient has sickle-cell disease and a history of jaundice, joint and bone pain since he was 5 months old. This suggests that the patient's condition is likely to be exacerbated by the removal of the spleen, which would increase the risk of infection.\n\nThe picture shows a slide obtained from the resected portion of the patient's spleen, which indicates that the dysfunction of zone marked with number 1 predisposes the patient to infections. This is supported by the literature which suggests that the infecting organism is predominantly pneumococcus and the course is fulminating and the mortality high.\n\nThe prophylactic vaccines provided against Neisseria meningitidis, Haemophilus influenzae, and Streptococcus pneumoniae are also relevant as they suggest that the patient's infection risk is increased due to the absence of their spleen.\", \"answer_choice\": D}"]
