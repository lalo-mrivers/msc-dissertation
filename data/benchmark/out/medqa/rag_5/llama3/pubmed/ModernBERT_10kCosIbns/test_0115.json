["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking which step in cross-bridge cycling will be blocked when a drug that selectively inhibits phosphate release by the myosin head is given to human muscle tissue. This drug would affect the myosin head's ability to release phosphate groups, which are necessary for the cross-bridge cycle. Therefore, we need to look at the steps in cross-bridge cycling and see where phosphate release occurs.\n\nThe key point here is that phosphate release by the myosin head occurs during the power stroke (step D). This is because the power stroke is when the myosin head uses the energy from ATP hydrolysis to generate force, which involves releasing phosphate groups. Therefore, the drug would most likely block step D, the power stroke.\", \n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
