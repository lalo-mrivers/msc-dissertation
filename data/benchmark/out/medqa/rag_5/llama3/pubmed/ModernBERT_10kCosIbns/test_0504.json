["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 3-year-old boy with difficulty understanding his speech, failure to respond when called by name, and inability to follow one-step instructions. He has a history of recurrent ear infections treated with antibiotics since birth and currently presents with conductive hearing loss on both sides. The otoscopic examination shows retracted tympanic membranes bilaterally that are immobile on pneumatic otoscopy, indicating middle ear effusion.
