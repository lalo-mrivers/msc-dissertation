["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about a 12-year-old girl who has difficulties making friends and exhibits specific behavioral characteristics. Based on the provided documents, it seems that the most relevant information is from the study on sociometric status and academic, behavioral, and psychological adjustment. This study suggests that children classified as rejected or controversial tend to fare more poorly on indices of long-term adjustment than do children classified as popular, neglected, or average. The girl in this question has not made any friends since starting middle school last year, which is a characteristic often seen in rejected sociometric status. Additionally, her teachers describe her as 'easily distracted' and 'easily upset by change', which could be indicative of some sort of developmental disorder.\n\nConsidering the other symptoms mentioned such as intense eye contact, flat affect, and concrete thought process, it seems that this girl's difficulties are not solely due to social or environmental factors but may also have an underlying psychological or neurodevelopmental basis. The most relevant study in this regard is [Nonpsychotic neuropsychic disorders as a basis for abnormal behavior in younger schoolchildren]. This study suggests that behavioral abnormalities are often related to borderline residual organic disorders, which could be contributing to the girl's difficulties.\n\nIn conclusion, considering all these factors, it seems that the disorder affecting this child is likely to be some sort of neurodevelopmental or psychological disorder rather than a purely social one. Therefore, it does not fit any of the common age ranges for typical neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism spectrum disorder (typically 2-5 years) or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (typically 3-7 years).\", \"answer_choice\": B}"]
