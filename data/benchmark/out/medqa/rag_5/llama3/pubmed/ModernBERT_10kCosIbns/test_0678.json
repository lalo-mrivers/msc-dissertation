["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the type of study. The researcher is randomizing patients to different treatment groups, which suggests that this is a between-group comparison study. The fact that there are multiple treatment arms and measured outcomes also supports the conclusion that this is not just a simple between-patient comparison. Therefore, we can eliminate option C.
