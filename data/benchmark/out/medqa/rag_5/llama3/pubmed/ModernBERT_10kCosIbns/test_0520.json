["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to the provided documents, mutations in the ATP2A1 gene result in loss of function of the calcium ATPase pump. This pump is responsible for regulating cytosolic Ca2+ concentrations and release of Ca2+ from the sarcoplasmic reticulum during muscle contraction. With a defective pump, it's expected that cytosolic Ca2+ concentrations would increase, leading to prolonged muscle contraction and relaxation time. The prolonged activation of skeletal muscle leads to fatigue due to reduced Ca2+ release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, which is also relevant in this context.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A: Muscle relaxation time: decreased, cytosolic calcium concentration: increased\""]
