["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with progressive pain and blurry vision in his right eye. He is struggling to open this eye because of the pain. The visual acuity in the left eye is 20/25, which is normal. In the right eye, he can only count fingers at 3 feet. This suggests a sudden onset of eye problem, possibly related to a inflammatory or infectious process.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe patient has bronchial asthma treated with inhaled salbutamol, but this is not directly relevant to his eye symptoms. He works as a kindergarten teacher, which may be important for the calculation of loss of earning capacity if needed.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe photograph of the right eye shows an abnormal pupil, which suggests acute glaucoma or iritis. However, the patient's description of pain and blurry vision is more consistent with iritis.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe presence of contact lenses may also be relevant, but it is not clear how this would affect the diagnosis.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
