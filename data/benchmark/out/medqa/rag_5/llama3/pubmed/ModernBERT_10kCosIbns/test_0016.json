["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about a 7-year-old boy with asthma who has seasonal symptoms worse during springtime. He is being considered for an experimental therapy that attenuates the activity of certain mediators which cause his asthmatic attacks. The targeted mediator favors the class switching of antibodies. Based on the information provided, we can infer that the mediator is involved in allergic responses and antibody production. From the documents, we know that asthma is an inflammatory disease and that inflammation plays a role in its pathogenesis. We also know that childhood asthma constitutes the same kind of chronic inflammatory processes as adult asthma and that its treatment should include anti-inflammatory drugs. Therefore, it is likely that the targeted mediator is involved in the allergic response and antibody production.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: IL-4\"\n}"]
