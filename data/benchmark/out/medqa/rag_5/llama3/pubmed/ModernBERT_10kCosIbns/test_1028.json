["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has a painless swelling over his right leg that was initially ignored but is now increasing in size. The surgeon performs a surgical resection of the tumor and sends the tissue for histopathological examination, which reports the tumor to be a liposarcoma rather than a lipoma. Liposarcomas are malignant tumors of adipose tissue, whereas lipomas are benign. Since the patient has a family history of lipomas, it is likely that his tumor is not metastatic. The question asks about an enzyme that shows increased activity in the cells of this patient's tumor. Considering the histopathological report and the patient's clinical presentation, we can rule out enzymes that are typically associated with malignancy or metastasis. Therefore, we need to focus on enzymes that are relevant to adipose tissue or liposarcoma.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
