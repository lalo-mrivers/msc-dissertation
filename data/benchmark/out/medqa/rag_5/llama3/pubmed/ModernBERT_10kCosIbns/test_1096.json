["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with red scaly plaques over both ears, which is an unusual presentation. The patient recently received a pair of silver earrings as a birthday present. This information suggests that the reaction may be related to the earrings. Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome (SSSS) is mentioned in one of the documents, and it is caused by certain phage group 2 staphylococci. However, this condition is typically seen in early childhood, and the patient is a 7-year-old woman. The document on SSSS also mentions that the lower incidence of SSSS in adults is primarily due to a superior capacity to metabolize and excrete the toxin, as well as more efficient immune capabilities.
