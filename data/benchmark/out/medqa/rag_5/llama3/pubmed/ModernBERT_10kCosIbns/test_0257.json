["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a male neonate with a serum phenylalanine concentration of 44 mg/dL. He was started on a special diet and the hyperphenylalaninemia resolved. The patient has persistent head lag, blue eyes, pale skin, blonde hair, and generalized hypotonia at a routine well-child examination 4 months later. His serum prolactin level is markedly elevated. Based on these symptoms, it appears that the patient has congenital hypopituitarism due to maternal phenylketonuria.\n\nAccording to the relevant documents, maternal phenylketonuria can cause fetal damage leading to reduced brain growth and cardiac malformations probably occurring within a few weeks of conception.\n\nThe patient's symptoms also suggest a possible genetic disorder. Phenylalanine is an amino acid that requires conversion to tyrosine for proper metabolic function. In the presence of maternal phenylketonuria, this conversion may be impaired, leading to hyperphenylalaninemia and subsequent fetal damage.\n\nGiven these findings, it appears that supplementation with Tyrosine would be most likely to prevent further complications in this patient's condition.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
