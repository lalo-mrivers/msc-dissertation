["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with an intermittent throbbing headache that started 3 weeks ago. The pain is bilateral, 'band-like', and extends to the neck. It's worsened by coughing or laughing, but not accompanied by nausea, vomiting, photophobia, or phonophobia. She has a history of hypertension and stable angina pectoris, and currently takes several medications. Her physical examination reveals S2 accentuation that is best heard in the second intercostal space at the right sternal border, and palpation of the paranasal sinuses is painless. The neurologic exam shows no focal symptoms, no pain on palpation of the trigeminal points, and no meningeal symptoms.

However, the fact that her headache is worsened by coughing or laughing suggests an external compression-type headache.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
