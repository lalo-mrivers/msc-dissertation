["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question describes a patient who sustained burns over 45% of her body. She develops tarry black stools 20 hours later. This symptom is likely related to the burn itself rather than any underlying gastrointestinal condition.

This suggests that her death may be related to sepsis rather than gastrointestinal bleeding.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
