["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the effects of cilostazol on peripheral vascular disease. In the first document, it is mentioned that cilostazol increases digital skin temperatures and blood flow to the digits. This suggests that cilostazol has a vasodilatory effect. In the second document, it is stated that cilostazol increased the cross-sectional area of the a. dorsalis pedis and the a. dorsalis pedis blood flow index. This further supports the idea that cilostazol has a vasodilatory effect. The third document does not provide direct information on the mechanism of action of cilostazol, but it suggests that cilostazol may have potential to prevent initiation and progression of atherosclerosis by interfering with the proliferation of arterial smooth muscle cells.\n\nTherefore, based on the available information, it can be concluded that cilostazol is a phosphodiesterase inhibitor, which increases cAMP levels and has a vasodilatory effect.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
