["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the patient's history of two normal vaginal deliveries at term and no reported complications, it is likely that she has a normal reproductive system. The patient is seeking elective abortion and does not have any specific medical conditions or complications that would require a particular method of termination. Therefore, I will consider the available options for elective termination of pregnancy.\n\nThe patient's previous menstrual cycles were regular, occurring every 28-35 days consistently, which suggests that she is at term or near term. This information helps to rule out manual uterine aspiration as an option, as this procedure is typically performed earlier in pregnancy (up to 12 weeks).\n\nOxytocin-induced labor may be a viable option for termination of pregnancy, but it requires a longer gestational age and is often used in situations where the patient is not far along in their pregnancy.\n\nDilatation and evacuation (D&E) is a common procedure for elective abortion and can be performed at any gestational age. It is a safe and effective method, with a low complication rate.\n\nOral mifepristone + misoprostol is a medication regimen that is used for medical abortion up to 49 days of gestation. Since the patient's last menstrual period was 4 weeks ago (suggesting she is around 16-17 weeks pregnant), this option would not be suitable.\n\nConsidering all these factors, I believe that D&E is the most appropriate procedure for elective termination of pregnancy in this patient.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
