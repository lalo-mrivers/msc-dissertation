["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with itchy blisters in his axilla, which he attributes to a poor diet. The physical examination reveals tense axillary bullae that do not rupture with light, gloved touch. Direct immunofluorescence shows linear C3 and IgG deposits along the basement membrane. Given these findings, we can rule out Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome as it does not typically present with blisters in the axilla. Pemphigus vulgaris is also unlikely given the tense bullae without rupture. Cicatricial pemphigoid may be a possibility but linear deposits on immunofluorescence are more consistent with Bullous pemphigoid.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
