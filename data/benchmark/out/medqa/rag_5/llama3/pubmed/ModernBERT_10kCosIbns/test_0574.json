["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks for a finding that confirms the diagnosis of loss of polyanions in glomerular basement membranes. We know from the given documents that proteinuria is related to changes in epithelial cell foot processes and podocytic detachment from the glomerular basement membrane. This suggests that there may be an issue with the integrity of the glomerular basement membrane, which is supported by the finding of mixed glomerular/tubular proteinuria in a patient without other underlying conditions. Therefore, we are looking for a finding that confirms this diagnosis. Upon reviewing the given documents, we find that thin glomerular basement membrane disease (TGBMD) is mentioned as one condition that can cause mixed glomerular/tubular proteinuria. We also know from another document that fusion of glomerular epithelial cell foot processes was present in all biopsies performed when the child had proteinuria, and the number of slit pores increased progressively towards normal after remission. This suggests that changes in the glomerular basement membrane may be related to proteinuria. Given this information, we can infer that a diagnosis of TGBMD would confirm our suspicion of loss of polyanions in the glomerular basement membranes.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
