["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has a transmural myocardial infarction in the posterior 1/3 of the ventricular septum. We can eliminate options B (diagonal perforators) and C (septal perforators) because they are not related to the posterolateral location of the infarction. The ECG returned to a near normal pattern on the 5th day, suggesting that the infarction was likely due to a coronary thrombus, which might have been caused by plaque rupture or erosion in a patient with only slight arteriosclerotic changes in their coronary arteries. This is supported by the document [Coronary angiographic findings in 308 patients with the clinical diagnosis of intramural myocardial infarction (author's transl)]. Therefore, option A: Left circumflex can be eliminated because it does not match the posterolateral location of the infarction and because the patient had only slight arteriosclerotic changes. The most likely scenario is that the right main artery was occluded.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
