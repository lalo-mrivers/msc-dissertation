["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with a sharp right-sided chest pain that worsens with deep inspiration, which is a common symptom of pulmonary embolism. Given the low risk of pulmonary embolism in this patient, we should start by ruling out other possible causes of his symptoms. The patient's history of gout, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and diabetes mellitus type 2 suggests that he may have a underlying condition that could be contributing to his chest pain. However, the sudden onset of his symptoms and the worsening with deep inspiration suggest that pulmonary embolism should still be considered.\n\nThe ECG is a reasonable first step in ruling out pulmonary embolism because it can help identify other possible causes of his symptoms, such as coronary artery disease or pericarditis. A V/Q scan would also be a good option because it can provide more information about the patient's lung function and potential for pulmonary embolism. D-dimer is not a reasonable first step in this case because it is a blood test that may not accurately diagnose pulmonary embolism, especially in low-risk patients.\n\nCT pulmonary angiogram with IV contrast would be the best option because it can provide high-quality images of the patient's lungs and pulmonary arteries, which could help identify or rule out pulmonary embolism. However, this test should only be ordered if the ECG and V/Q scan do not suggest an alternative explanation for the patient's symptoms.\", \"answer_choice\": D}"]
