["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with chronic diarrhea, malodorous stools, stunted growth, abdominal cramps, itchy rash, and oral aphthous ulcers. The symptoms developed around 2 years ago. The patient was exclusively breastfed until 7 months and then supplementary feeding started with non-starchy vegetables, followed by starchy vegetables, meat, fish, eggs, and bread. Bread and cookies were the last products to be introduced at 12 months. The mother tried to withdraw dairy products but it did not help. The patient has pale skin, papulovesicular rash on abdomen and back, oral aphthous ulcers, distended abdomen, and no tenderness or hepatosplenomegaly. Immunological assay shows positive anti-transglutaminase and anti-endomysial antibodies.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe key features of this patient are chronic diarrhea, stunted growth, rash, and immunological abnormalities (positive anti-transglutaminase and anti-endomysial antibodies). This suggests a diagnosis of celiac disease. Villous atrophy is a common finding in intestinal biopsy specimens of patients with celiac disease.\\r\\n\\r\\nTherefore, based on the patient's symptoms and laboratory findings, I would most likely expect to see villous atrophy on intestinal biopsy.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
