["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about a 76-year-old man who has been diagnosed with gastric adenocarcinoma and refuses life-prolonging treatment. The patient requests palliative care without significant healthcare costs. To determine the patient's eligibility for hospice care, we need to assess his terminal status. According to the relevant documents, a patient is considered terminally ill when they have advanced cancer, weight loss of 10 kg or more plus cognitive failure (Mini-Mental State Questionnaire less than 24) plus dysphagia to solids or liquids.
