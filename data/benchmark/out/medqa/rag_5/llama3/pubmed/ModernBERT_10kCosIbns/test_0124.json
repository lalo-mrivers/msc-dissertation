["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the signs and symptoms that would NOT be expected to be observed in a child with congenital hypothyroidism caused by inadequate maternal iodine intake. The relevant documents mention neonatal hypothyroidism, which can occur due to iodine deficiency. This condition is characterized by elevated TSH levels. Hypotonia (muscle weakness) and umbilical hernia are common signs of hypothyroidism in newborns. Diarrhea is not a typical symptom of congenital hypothyroidism. Macroglossia (enlarged tongue) can be seen in cretinous patients, but it's less relevant to neonatal hypothyroidism caused by maternal iodine deficiency. Therefore, the answer would NOT include diarrhea.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
