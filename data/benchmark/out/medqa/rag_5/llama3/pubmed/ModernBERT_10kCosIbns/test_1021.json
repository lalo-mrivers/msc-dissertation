["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient had a fever and chills two hours after elective cholecystectomy. She received cephalexin for antibiotic prophylaxis and one unit of packed red blood cells during the procedure. The presence of fever and chills is concerning, but considering her recent history of hysterectomy and hypertension treated with lisinopril, it's unlikely to be related to malignant hyperthermia or adverse effect of medication. Her temperature is 39.5°C (102.3°F), which is not extremely high, ruling out the possibility of a severe infection like sepsis.
