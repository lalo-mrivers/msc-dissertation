He has a history of general illness for the past week and is known to be hypertensive but noncompliant with medications for the last 20 years. The physical examination reveals dry skin, ecchymoses, and conjunctival pallor. His blood pressure is 180/99 mm Hg, heart rate is 89/min, and respiratory rate is 17/min. The initial laboratory results are remarkable for hemoglobin of 10 g/dL, mean corpuscular volume of 90 Î¼m3, platelet count of 200,000/mm3, blood urea nitrogen of 29 mg/dL, and creatinine of 2.1 mg/dL.
