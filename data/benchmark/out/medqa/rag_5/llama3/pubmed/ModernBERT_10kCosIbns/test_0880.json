["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 21-year-old woman with sudden onset of high blood pressure. She has no family history of hypertension or metabolic syndromes. On examination, her blood pressure is 145/92 mm Hg, which is already elevated. There is also mention of her face getting red at times while at work, and she uses blankets to cover her feet even on warm days. This suggests that psychosocial factors may be playing a role in her hypertension.

Given these findings, I think that psychosocial factors are likely contributing to her condition.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
