["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 6-year-old boy with abdominal distention, fatigue, night sweats, post-prandial fullness, recurrent nonbilious vomiting, pale appearance, hepatosplenomegaly, shifting dullness, mild tenderness to palpation, and multiple nonblanching maculae. A CT scan shows mesenteric and retroperitoneal lymph node enlargement and nodular thickening of the omentum. The biopsy specimen from an enlarged mesenteric lymph node is examined with immunohistochemical staining showing a high proliferation index (> 99%). This suggests a rapidly proliferating population, which is consistent with a diagnosis of neoplasia. Additionally, the patient's age and clinical presentation are more suggestive of childhood cancer rather than reactive changes or infectious causes.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
