["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 7-day-old infant boy presenting with poor feeding, decreased wet diapers, and stooling. He had been breastfeeding well until 24 hours ago when mom noticed he started having trouble latching. In the last 12 hours, he has completely refused to feed. This is not related to an infectious organism as initial screening bloodwork is normal. The patient's symptoms are more related to a potential failure-to-thrive syndrome. He has increased tone, clenched jaw, no head lag, and clenched hands on exam, which suggests that the problem may be related to his feeding habits. One of the documents mentions a study about selected behaviors of both mother and infant during feeding being predictors of weight gain during the 1st month of life. Another document talks about infants who attend infant welfare clinics being accurately weighed and their progress carefully recorded on weight charts, which could help detect this problem earlier.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
