["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided, we know that ovarian cancer can metastasize to various sites including the diaphragm, retroperitoneal lymph nodes, omentum, and peritoneal fluid. Since this patient has stage IV disease with confirmed distant metastases in the lungs and brain, it is likely that the malignancy spread through the lymphatic system. According to [Pathology of the malignant ovarian tumours (author's transl)], early development of metastases to the diaphragm seems to have a particular bearing on the spreading of ovarian cancers. Given this information, we can infer that the malignancy may have followed a similar route. Considering the anatomical location of the brain and the fact that most ovarian cancer metastasizes to the lung first, it is likely that the malignancy spread through the thoracic duct.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
