["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the management of a newborn infant delivered to an HIV-infected mother who received triple antiretrovural therapy during pregnancy. The mother's viral load was 678 copies/mL one week prior to delivery, indicating that the treatment was effective in reducing the viral load. Since the mother received triple antiretroviral therapy, it is likely that the infant will be positive for HIV-antibody at birth, as reported in the relevant document about infants born to HIV-infected mothers. However, the question does not ask about the diagnosis of HIV infection but rather the management of the newborn.\n\nThe next step in the management of this infant would be to test its DNA or RNA to determine whether it is infected with HIV. Since zidovudine (option A) is a medication used for prevention of mother-to-child transmission, it is not the most appropriate option. Reassurance and follow-up (option D) are important, but they are not the primary step in managing this infant.\n\nTherefore, options B and C both refer to HIV DNA or RNA testing, which would be the most appropriate next step in the management of this infant.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
