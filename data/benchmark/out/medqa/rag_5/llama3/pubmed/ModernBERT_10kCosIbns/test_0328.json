["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with severe pelvic pain and is admitted in active labor. The cervix is 100% effaced and 10 cm dilated. She has a history of gestational diabetes, but her vital signs are within normal limits. After epidural anesthesia, the patient's symptoms improve, but she develops dizziness with a blood pressure reading of 90/60 mmHg. Considering these findings, the most likely underlying cause of the patient's hypotension is not acute pulmonary hypertension or aortocaval compression, as there are no signs of respiratory distress or cardiac complications. Sympathetic block due to epidural anesthesia could be a possibility, but given the patient's history and current condition, hypovolemia seems more likely.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
