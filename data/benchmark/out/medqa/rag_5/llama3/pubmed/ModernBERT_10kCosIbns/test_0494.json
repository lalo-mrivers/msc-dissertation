["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the pregnancy of a 23-year-old woman who had no prenatal care. The two newborns have different weights (2050g vs 2850g) and hematocrit levels (42% vs 71%). This suggests that they may be twins, possibly with a difference in growth rates.

However, we need more information to determine the type of twinning.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
