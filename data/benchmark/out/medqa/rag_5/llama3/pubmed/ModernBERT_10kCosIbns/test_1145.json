["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 33-year-old woman with a painless mass in her right breast that has not increased in size. Physical examination shows a rubbery, mobile mass in the upper outer quadrant of the right breast. A biopsy shows rounded contour with overgrowth of fibrous and glandular tissue. Given this information, we can eliminate options B (Normal pregnancy-related changes) and C (Fat necrosis), as they do not match the physical characteristics of the mass. We are left with options A (Fibroadenoma), D (Phyllodes tumor). Fibroadenomas are benign tumors that typically present as a solitary, mobile mass in young women. The patient's age and the physical examination findings support this diagnosis.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
