["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The new experimental drug increases incretin levels by preventing their degradation at the endothelium. This further increases glucose-dependent insulin production. Incretins are hormones that stimulate insulin secretion. Sitagliptin is an inhibitor of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4), which prevents the degradation of incretins such as GLP-1 and GIP, allowing them to stimulate insulin secretion for a longer period. This mechanism is similar to the experimental drug's action. Therefore, the answer is A: Sitagliptin.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
