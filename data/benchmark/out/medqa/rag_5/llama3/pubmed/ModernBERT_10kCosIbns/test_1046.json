["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Given a normal distribution of hemoglobin concentration with a mean concentration of 17 g/dL and a standard error of 0.1 g/dL, we can calculate the probability that a subject will have a hemoglobin concentration greater than 18 g/dL. First, we need to find the z-score corresponding to a hemoglobin concentration of 18 g/dL: (18 - 17) / 0.1 = 1. This means our desired hemoglobin concentration is 1 standard deviation above the mean. Since the probability of any value occurring within 1 standard deviation of the mean is approximately 68%, we can infer that approximately 32% of values will be more than 1 standard deviation away from the mean, which includes values greater than 18 g/dL.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
