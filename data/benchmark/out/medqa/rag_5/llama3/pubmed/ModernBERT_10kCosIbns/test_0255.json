["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question describes a known mutation in the Kozak sequence of the Beta-globin gene that leads to thalassemia intermedia. Thalassemia is characterized by decreased or absent production of hemoglobin, which affects the morphology of red blood cells. Since the mutation does not abolish translation but decreases it, we can expect a mild reduction in hemoglobin production. This would lead to microcytic (smaller than normal) and hypochromic (decreased hemoglobin content) red blood cells, consistent with the typical findings in thalassemia.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
