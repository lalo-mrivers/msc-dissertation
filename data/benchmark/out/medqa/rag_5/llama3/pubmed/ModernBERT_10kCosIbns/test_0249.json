["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine how the positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) of the diagnostic test will be affected when the prevalence of CMV retinitis decreases due to increased access to antiretroviral therapy, we need to analyze the relationship between the prevalence of CMV retinitis and the PPV and NPV of the test.\n\nFrom the literature provided, we know that a T-cell ratio less than 0.11 is a good screening index for early CMV retinitis (Screening indices for cytomegalovirus retinitis in patients with human immunodeficiency virus). This indicates that the prevalence of CMV retinitis is related to the immune function of the patient.\n\nWhen the prevalence of CMV retinitis decreases due to increased access to antiretroviral therapy, it means that the immune function of the patient has improved. Therefore, the T-cell ratio will be higher than 0.11 for most patients, and the PPV will decrease because more true negatives (patients without CMV retinitis) will be detected.\n\nOn the other hand, the NPV will increase because fewer false positives (patients with a negative test result but actually having CMV retinitis) will be detected. This is because the T-cell ratio will be higher than 0.11 for most patients, and only those with a lower T-cell ratio will have CMV retinitis.\n\nTherefore, when the prevalence of CMV retinitis decreases due to increased access to antiretroviral therapy, the PPV will decrease and the NPV will increase.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
