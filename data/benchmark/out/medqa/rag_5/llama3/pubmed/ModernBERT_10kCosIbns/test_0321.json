["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is experiencing breathlessness and chest pain, which could be related to respiratory or cardiac issues. The absence of significant findings on physical examination and the normal chest X-ray make a pneumothorax unlikely. The patient's symptoms are more consistent with a pulmonary embolism (PE). Given his history of recent knee replacement surgery, PE is a possible diagnosis. The ECG showing sinus tachycardia also supports this theory.\n\nConsidering the patient's stable vital signs and the absence of other significant findings on physical examination, the best course of management at this time would be to rule out or confirm the presence of a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in his right leg. This could be achieved through a lower extremity doppler ultrasound, which is the most relevant and effective investigation at this point.\n\nThe other options do not provide an adequate solution for addressing the patient's symptoms and concerns. Subcutaneous fondaparinux may be considered as part of further management if a DVT is confirmed, but it is not the primary step in managing the patient's current condition. An inferior vena cava filter would also be considered later if a PE is diagnosed, but it does not provide immediate benefits for this patient's symptoms. A ventilation-perfusion scan may be useful in diagnosing a PE, but it is a more complex investigation that should only be performed after a DVT has been ruled out or confirmed.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
