["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is 28 years old, gravida 2, para 1 at 40 weeks of gestation. She has had an uncomplicated pregnancy with regular prenatal appointments and no history of serious illness. Her first child was delivered via normal vaginal delivery. Cervical examination shows 100% effacement and 10 cm dilation, indicating that the patient is in active labor.\n\nGiven these circumstances, the most important consideration is to ensure the well-being of both the mother and the fetus. Since there are no contraindications to vaginal delivery, the initial step should be to support the patient's natural progress towards delivery.\n\nA cardiotocograph (CTG) is used to monitor the fetal heart rate. However, without further information about the CTG tracing, it cannot be determined whether there are any concerns that would warrant more immediate intervention.\n\nIn this scenario, the most appropriate initial step in management is to provide reassurance and support to the patient while monitoring her progress. This approach allows for a natural progression towards delivery while minimizing the risk of complications.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C: Reassurance\"\n}"]
