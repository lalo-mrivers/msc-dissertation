["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has a severe fear reaction to seeing dogs after moving into a new suburban neighborhood. She has always had an irrational and excessive fear of dogs but was able to avoid it for most of her life while living in the city. The fact that she is having trouble coping with this phobia despite avoiding dogs suggests that avoidance may not be effective in reducing symptoms. Considering the patient's fear began in childhood, and dog-fearful adults reported many other fears in addition to their fear of dogs, it seems likely that this phobia has a long history. The fact that most adults reported that their fear began in childhood also suggests that childhood experiences may have played a role in the development of this phobia. Given the patient's avoidance behaviors and severe symptoms, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is a good starting point for treatment.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: Cognitive behavioral therapy\""]
