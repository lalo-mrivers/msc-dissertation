["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's ultrasound shows a hypoechoic nodule with a size of 2 cm. The histological examination of the fine needle biopsy reported a likely suspicion of neoplasia, which could be malignant. Considering this, we need to think about potential metastatic sites. Malignancy was present in 88 cases (12.27%) and mainly occurred in the 3rd and 5th decade of life. The most common types of malignancy were papilliferous tumours, follicular, Hurthle-cell, and anaplastic. According to 'Aetiology and diagnosis of malignant tumours of the thyroid gland', small doses of irradiation in childhood may induce a papillary or follicular carcinoma. Considering this, we can assume that our patient's tumor is likely to be one of these types. The most common metastatic sites for thyroid cancer are bones and/or lungs. Therefore, the most likely initial metastatic site in this patient is either bone or lung.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B: Cervical lymph nodes\"\n}"]
