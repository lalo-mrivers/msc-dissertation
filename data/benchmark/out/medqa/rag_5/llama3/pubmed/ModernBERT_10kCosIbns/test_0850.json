["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient was struck by a high-voltage power line on his right arm. He is experiencing pain bilaterally in the flanks as well as in his right arm where contact with the power line occurred. This suggests that the electrical current may have passed directly through his heart, causing ventricular fibrillations. The presence of a 6 cm burn on the right arm also supports this theory. Therefore, I would first consider conducting an EEG to assess for any cardiac irregularities or signs of ventricular fibrillation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
