["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, I did not find any information directly related to a kidney biopsy specimen or histologic examination findings. However, since we are dealing with recurrent urinary tract infections and bilateral dilation of the renal pelvis, I will consider the possibility of hydronephrosis or other urinary tract malformations. Since voiding cystourethrography showed retrograde flow of contrast into the ureters during micturition, it is likely that the patient has vesico-ureteric reflux (VUR) which can lead to recurrent UTIs and kidney damage.
