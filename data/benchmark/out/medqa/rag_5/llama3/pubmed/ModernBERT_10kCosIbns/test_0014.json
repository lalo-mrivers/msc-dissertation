["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking which type of virus can undergo a process where two viruses from the same family infect a host cell simultaneously, resulting in the production of new genome segments that are packaged into a novel and viable virus particle. According to the provided documents, RNA viruses have high error frequencies due to their replicase enzymes, leading to rapid evolution. This suggests that RNA viruses may be more likely to undergo this process. DNA viruses tend to replicate inside cell nuclei with low error frequencies, making it less likely for them to produce new genome segments and form novel virus particles.\", \"answer_choice\": B}"]
