["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) and presents with left eye pain and reduced vision. She has no additional symptoms. The vital signs are normal. On exam, she has no vision in her left eye but 20/30 visual acuity in her right eye. When shining a light in her left eye there is no response. This suggests an optic nerve problem or damage to the retina. Since SLE can affect the eyes, it's likely that the patient's symptoms are related to SLE. The patient's right eye is normal, so we should expect a normal response when shining a light in her right eye.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
