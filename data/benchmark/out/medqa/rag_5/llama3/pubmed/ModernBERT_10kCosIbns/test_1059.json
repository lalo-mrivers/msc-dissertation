["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about a patient who is an opioid abuser undergoing emergency surgery. He reports intense pain 6 hours after the conclusion of the surgery despite being on PCA for postoperative pain management. The risk of developing postoperative hyperalgesia in this case is high due to his opioid tolerance. To reduce this risk, the agent that could have been given intraoperatively is one that would provide analgesic and/or sedative effects without increasing the patient's respiratory depression risk. \n\nThe answer lies in understanding that opioids are not the best choice for this patient. The text states that opioid agonist analgesics can mask postoperative complications, and opioid tolerance means that the usual dose of opioid may not be effective. Therefore, an alternative agent is needed to reduce pain.\n\nLooking at the available options, ketamine could have been given intraoperatively as it provides analgesic effects without increasing respiratory depression risk. It has been shown to be effective in reducing postoperative pain and can also help reduce the risk of developing postoperative hyperalgesia.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
