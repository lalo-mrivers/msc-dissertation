["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about a 3-month-old girl with central cyanosis, severe pulmonary outflow obstruction, right ventricular hypertrophy, a ventricular septal defect, and an overriding of the aorta. The condition is tetralogy of Fallot. We need to identify which statement is true about her condition.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe question mentions no signs of respiratory distress or heart failure, so we can rule out option D (Refractory heart failure is a common complication of tetralogy of Fallot).\\r\\n\\r\\nOption A refers to bacterial endocarditis in uncorrected tetralogy of Fallot, which is not relevant to this girl's condition since she will have an elective primary surgical repair.\\r\\n\\r\\nOption B talks about normal hemoglobin in patients with tetralogy of Fallot not ruling out iron deficiency anemia. While this is a possible complication, it does not directly relate to the girl's condition.\\r\\n\\r\\nOption C mentions cerebral arterial thrombosis being more common than cerebral venous thrombosis. This option seems unrelated to the girl's condition.\\r\\n\\r\\nBased on the given information, the only option that directly relates to the girl's condition is the hemostatic defects in cyanotic congenital heart disease document, which talks about deficiencies in vitamin K-dependent factors (prothrombin, factors VII and IX) and factor V. This indicates that Cerebral arterial thrombosis could be a complication.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
