["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the most effective way to prevent transmission of a picornavirus that preferentially infects hepatocytes. The given documents provide information on various viruses and their resistance to chemico-physical decontamination methods. The picornavirus is not specifically mentioned in these documents, but we can use our knowledge of virology to answer the question. We know that picornaviruses are a group of viruses that include enteroviruses, which were mentioned as being relatively stable in the 'Variations in resistance of viruses from different groups to chemico-physical decontamination methods' document.\n\nHowever, we can infer that a disinfectant capable of inactivating influenza A virus, which was mentioned as having low resistance, could also be effective against our picornavirus. Sodium hypochlorite is a virucidal substance that was tested for its effectiveness against various viruses and showed good results. Therefore, it is the most likely disinfectant to inactivate our picornavirus.\n\nIn addition, the documents do not mention any specific study on the resistance of picornaviruses to chemico-physical decontamination methods or their susceptibility to inactivation by different disinfectants. However, based on our knowledge of virology and the information provided, we can infer that Sodium hypochlorite is the most likely disinfectant to inactivate this virus.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
