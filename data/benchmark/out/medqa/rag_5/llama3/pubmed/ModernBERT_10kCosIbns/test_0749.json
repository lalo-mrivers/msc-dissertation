["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Upon reviewing the patient's symptoms, including a severe headache, pain in his jaw that is worse when he chews, tenderness over the scalp, jaw, and temporal area, and taking alprazolam for insomnia, I would consider the possibility of muscle contraction headache (also known as tension headache) or cervicogenic headache. Given the presence of headache symptoms consistent with muscle contraction headache and the patient's past medical history of insomnia, which may be related to anxiety or depression, I think a more likely cause is muscle contraction headache. The patient's report of jaw pain that worsens when chewing suggests possible TMJ involvement, which could contribute to the headache.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
