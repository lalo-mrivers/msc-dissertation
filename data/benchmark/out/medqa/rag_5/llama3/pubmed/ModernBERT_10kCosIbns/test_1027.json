["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the provided documents, we can see that heparin is absorbed from the lung, causing significant changes in coagulation parameters. The studies suggest a prolonged moderate anticoagulant state with intrapulmonary heparin. For doses of 8-20 mg/kg, there was a corresponding increase in the area under the response curve.\n\nIn this case, we are considering intravenous heparin administration. From the document 'Heparin kinetics in venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism', we can see that the heparin regimen consisted of an initial injection of 70 units per kg, followed by a maintenance dose of 400 units per kg per 24 hours.\n\nWe are trying to calculate the most appropriate loading dose for this patient. The volume of distribution of heparin is equivalent to 60 mL/kg, and the target peak plasma concentration is 0.5 units/mL.\", \"answer_choice\": A}"]
