["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with a 6-month history of progressive pain and stiffness of the fingers of her right hand. The symptoms are worse at the end of the day. Physical examination shows swelling, joint-line tenderness, and decreased range of motion of the first metacarpophalangeal joint and the distal interphalangeal joints of the right hand. Discrete, hard, mildly tender nodules are palpated over the 2nd and 4th distal interphalangeal joints of the right hand. An x-ray of her right hand shows narrowing of the interphalangeal joint spaces with subchondral sclerosis and osteophytes.\n\nThe patient's history of working as a typist for 28 years suggests an occupational soft tissue disorder of the hand and forearm, which may be related to repetitive strain injury or tendinitis.
