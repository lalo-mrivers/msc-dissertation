["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The woman's brother has mild developmental delay, pale complexion, and requires a diet limiting phenylalanine due to a genetic disorder. Since the woman is healthy, we can assume she doesn't have the condition. However, her brother could be affected with an autosomal recessive disorder or an X-linked dominant disorder. Autosomal recessive disorders typically follow Mendel's laws of inheritance, so if the brother is affected and has no similar symptoms in their parents, it suggests that both parents are carriers of the recessive allele. The woman, being the sibling of the affected brother, could be a carrier of the recessive allele as well. Therefore, we should assess her carrier status for the disease affecting her brother.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B: 100%\""]
