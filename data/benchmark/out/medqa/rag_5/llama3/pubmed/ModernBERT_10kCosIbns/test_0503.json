["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, we are looking for normal values for right ventricular pressures. In the first document, 'The evaluation of incremental positive end-expiratory pressure on right ventricular hemodynamics as determined by the thermodilution technique', it is mentioned that at 15 cmH2O PEEP, RVEF, RVEDVI and RVESVI were comparable with the baseline, while right arterial pressure increased significantly compared with the baseline. However, this document does not provide specific values for normal right ventricular pressures.\n\nIn the second document, 'Pulmonary artery compliance: its role in right ventricular-arterial coupling', it is mentioned that Ea increased significantly as mean pulmonary artery pressure rose, but Ees remained linear and constant. This suggests that the right ventricle operates at maximum efficiency and submaximal work output under normal conditions.\n\nIn the third document, 'Myocardial perfusion and function during acute right ventricular systolic hypertension', it is mentioned that the right ventricular systolic pressure approached 90 mmHg, but this was during a state of acute pulmonary hypertension. This does not provide information about normal right ventricular pressures.\n\nFinally, in the fourth document, 'Right ventricular diastolic pressure in coronary artery disease', it is mentioned that abnormal right ventricular filling pressures occurred only in patients with an abnormal right ventricular systolic pressure or an abnormal left ventricular end-diastolic pressure. This does not provide information about normal right ventricular pressures.\n\nConsidering these documents, the cardiology fellow's recording of a pulmonary wedge pressure of 10 mmHg suggests that the patient's right ventricle is functioning normally. Therefore, we can infer that the normal values for right ventricular pressures are likely to be similar to those recorded.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C: 10/0 mmHg\""]
