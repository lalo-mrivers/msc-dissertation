["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with symptoms of fatigue, weight loss, blurred vision, headache, and memory impairment. The physical exam is notable for anemia and general weakness. Laboratory studies reveal elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate and a sharp, narrow spike of monoclonal IgM on serum protein electrophoresis. Given the presence of monoclonal IgM, Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia is a possible diagnosis.

This suggests that multiple myeloma may also be a possibility.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
