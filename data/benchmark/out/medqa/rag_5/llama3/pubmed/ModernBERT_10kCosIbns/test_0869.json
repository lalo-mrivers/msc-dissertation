["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, we need to determine the total number of people with GERD in the town. The data shows that out of 600 participants (200 alcoholics + 400 non-alcoholics), 30 developed GERD. This is a fixed number, and it doesn't depend on whether people drink or not. The fraction of people with GERD is therefore 30/600.\n\nNext, we need to determine the number of people who would have GERD if everyone in the town continued drinking. We can assume that the rate of GERD among non-alcoholics (30/400) is the same as the overall rate of GERD (30/600). This gives us 30/400.\n\nNow, we need to determine the number of people who would have GERD if everyone in the town stopped drinking. We can assume that the rate of GERD among alcoholics (30/200) is the same as the overall rate of GERD (30/600). This gives us 15/300.\n\nFinally, by subtracting the number of people who would have GERD if everyone stopped drinking from the total number of people with GERD, we can determine the number of cases that could be prevented. The difference is 30/600 - 15/300 = (30/200) / (30/400).\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
