The result shows an indefinite uterus pattern, which is commonly associated with diagnostic error. Therefore, I will look for relevant information in the documents about the uterine size and its changes during the menstrual cycle.

Given that the patient's menses are 4 weeks overdue, it is possible that she may be in the latter part of her menstrual cycle or even post-menopausal. The document 'The atrophic postmenopausal uterus' suggests that after 65 years of age, the uterus typically appears atrophic.
