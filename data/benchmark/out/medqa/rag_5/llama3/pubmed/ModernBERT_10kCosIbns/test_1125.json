["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 15-year-old female with severe menstrual cramping. Her cycles became regular every 28-35 days after an irregular period for two years, suggesting that her reproductive system has matured. She reports some periods being 'really heavy' and requiring superabsorbent pads, but this does not limit her activities. The patient's symptoms suggest dysmenorrhea, which is a common problem in family practice populations. The study on A case control survey and dysmenorrhea in a family practice population suggests that menstrual pain can be severe enough to cause temporary disability. Given the patient's Tanner IV breasts and pubic hair, it is likely that she has reached menarche and her reproductive system is functioning normally. Considering the patient's symptoms and physical exam findings, the best next step would be to recommend over-the-counter NSAIDs (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) such as ibuprofen or naproxen, which are commonly used to treat menstrual cramps.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
