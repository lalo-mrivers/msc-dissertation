["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has symptoms of heart failure with a history of hypertension. The lab results suggest an elevated B-type natriuretic peptide, which is consistent with left ventricular dysfunction. The echocardiogram reveals an enlarged left atrium and an ejection fraction of 55%. Given the patient's condition, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) are likely to be effective in managing his symptoms. Valsartan is an ARB, but considering the novel drugs listed, Sacubitril is a combination of sacubitril and valsartan and is more likely to benefit the patient.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C: Sacubitril\""]
