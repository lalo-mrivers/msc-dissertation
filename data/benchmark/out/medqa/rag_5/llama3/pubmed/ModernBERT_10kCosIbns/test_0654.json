["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is 18 years old and has not menstruated yet. The physical examination shows breast development, pubic hair at Tanner stage 5, and axillary hair, indicating that the patient is going through puberty. The lab results show FSH levels of 7 mIU/mL, which are in the follicular phase range. Estradiol levels are also within the normal range for the mid-follicular phase. Testosterone levels are slightly elevated but still within the normal range. Given these findings, it is unlikely that the patient has a hormonal disorder such as hyperprolactinemia or androgen insensitivity.\n\nThe patient's physical examination suggests that she is going through puberty normally, and her lab results support this. The presence of breast development, pubic hair, and axillary hair indicates that the patient's gonads are functioning normally.\n\nThe only abnormal finding is the absence of menstruation. Menstrual irregularity or amenorrhea can occur due to various reasons such as delayed menarche, which is common during adolescence. Given the patient's physical examination and lab results, it is likely that she has a condition that is causing her menstrual delay.\n\nMuellerian agenesis is a rare congenital disorder where the Mullerian duct does not develop. This would explain the absence of menstruation, but it is unlikely given the patient's normal pubertal development.\n\nTurner syndrome is a genetic disorder characterized by short stature, webbed neck, and amenorrhea. The patient's physical examination does not show any features of Turner syndrome.\n\nAndrogen insensitivity is a rare genetic disorder where the body does not respond to androgens, which can cause hyperandrogenism (masculinization). This would explain the patient's normal pubertal development but delayed menarche.\n\nGiven these findings, I think that the most likely diagnosis is delayed menarche, which is a common condition during adolescence.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
