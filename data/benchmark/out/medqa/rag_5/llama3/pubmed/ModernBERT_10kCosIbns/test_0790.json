["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks for the dosage of amoxicillin that should be administered at each dosing interval to maintain a steady state. The target plasma concentration is 2 mg/L, and the oral bioavailability is 75%. This means that the amount of drug absorbed into the bloodstream will be 0.75 x dose.\n\nFrom the pharmacokinetics study, we can see that the absorption rate constant is 1.3/h for a 250 mg dose and 0.7/h for a 1000 mg dose. Since the dose we are looking for is not explicitly given in the question, we will need to calculate it based on the target plasma concentration.\n\nLet's start by calculating the amount of drug absorbed into the bloodstream. This can be done using the following equation: Amount = Bioavailability x Dose\n\nWe know that the bioavailability is 0.75 and the target plasma concentration is 2 mg/L. To find the dose, we need to divide the target plasma concentration by the bioavailability: Dose = Target Plasma Concentration / Bioavailability\n\nDose = 2 mg/L / 0.75 = 266.67 mg\n\nSince the question asks for a twice-daily dosing interval, the total daily dose would be twice the calculated dose: Total Daily Dose = 2 x 266.67 mg = 533.34 mg\n\nTo maintain a steady state, the half-life of the drug needs to be taken into account. The half-life is not given in the question, but we can assume it is around 1 hour based on similar antibiotics.\n\nThe formula for calculating the dosing interval is: Dosing Interval = -ln(0.5) / (0.693 x Half-Life)\n\nWe don't have the exact half-life, but we know that the absorption rate constant is 1.3/h for a 250 mg dose and 0.7/h for a 1000 mg dose. This suggests that the half-life might be around 1 hour.\n\nUsing this value, we can calculate the dosing interval: Dosing Interval = -ln(0.5) / (0.693 x 1 hr) = 2 hours\n\nSince the question asks for the dosage at each dosing interval, we need to divide the total daily dose by the dosing interval: Dosage per interval = Total Daily Dose / Dosing Interval\n\nDosage per interval = 533.34 mg / 2 hours = 266.67 mg/hour\n\nThis is equivalent to approximately 267 mg every 2 hours.\n\nComparing this value with the given options, we can see that the closest match is B: 480 mg.\", \n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
