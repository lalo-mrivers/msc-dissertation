["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has a 1-week history of yellowish discoloration of his skin and generalized pruritus. The examination shows jaundice of the skin and scleral icterus. Urinalysis shows an elevated concentration of bilirubin and a low concentration of urobilinogen. This suggests that there is an issue with bile excretion or absorption, rather than hemolysis (since urobilinogen levels are low). Considering the documents provided, we can rule out Absent UDP-glucuronosyltransferase activity as it would not cause jaundice and pruritus. Increased intestinal bilirubin reabsorption is also unlikely given the urinalysis results. Defective hepatic bile excretion is a more plausible explanation, especially in light of the skin manifestations described in [Skin manifestations in patients with renal chronic renal failure on regular hemodyalysis], which mentions jaundice and pruritus as common symptoms.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
