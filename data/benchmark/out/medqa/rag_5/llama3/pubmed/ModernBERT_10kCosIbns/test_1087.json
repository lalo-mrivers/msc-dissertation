["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 39-year-old man who has experienced syncope at work. He also complains of increasing shortness of breath while exercising over the past 6 months. His vital signs are normal except for a harsh systolic ejection murmur on cardiac examination, which is accentuated by forceful expiration against a closed airway. This suggests that he may have structural heart disease, possibly hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. The presence of a harsh systolic ejection murmur at the left lower sternal border and 2 closely spaced pulses in the carotid artery during systole are consistent with this diagnosis. Syncope is a common problem in patients with cardiac syncope, and ventricular tachycardia is a common cause. Therefore, EP testing would be useful to exclude ventricular tachycardia as the cause of his symptoms.\", \"answer_choice\": C}"]
