["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about substances released locally to increase coronary blood flow during exertion. The relevant documents mention exercise electrocardiogram (EXECG), maximal rate pressure product (MAXRPP), and exercise chest pain (EXCP) as parameters that contribute unique predictive information with the emergence of two interactions involving EXCP. The presence or absence of chest pain wasn't valuable markers in the differential diagnosis of true and false positive ST segment depression. Frequency of three-vessel disease was significantly higher in patients who had significant ST segment depression during exercise stress test either with or without anginal pain. This information doesn't directly answer the question about substances released locally to increase coronary blood flow during exertion.\n\nHowever, we can refer to another document that discusses systolic time intervals before and after maximal exercise treadmill testing for evaluation of chest pain. The study found that patients with chest pain and abnormal findings on coronary arteriograms had at least a 10-msec prolongation in the left ventricular ejection time index (LVETI) after exercise, whereas patients without heart disease or with normal findings on coronary arteriograms did not have such prolongation. This information doesn't directly answer the question either.\n\nAnother document discusses acute chest pain and outlines a diagnostic strategy. The causes of acute chest pain include myocardial infarction, dissecting aneurysm, and pulmonary embolism, which are life-threatening conditions that require immediate attention. However, this document does not provide information about substances released locally to increase coronary blood flow during exertion.\n\nThe last document discusses exercise stress testing in patients with chest pain and normal coronary arteriography. It found that 24% of patients had positive studies on treadmill electrocardiography, while 12% had incomplete tests. This information doesn't directly answer the question either.\n\nAfter reviewing all the documents, we can conclude that the question is not directly answered by any of the provided information. However, we can refer to other resources or texts that discuss physiological responses during exercise and cardiovascular physiology. According to these sources, one substance released locally to increase coronary blood flow during exertion is Adenosine.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
