["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is 19 weeks pregnant with a history of childhood murmur. She complains of dizziness and dyspnea on exertion which has increased during pregnancy. Vital signs show blood pressure 125/60 mm Hg, heart rate 81/min, respiratory rate 13/min, and temperature 36.7°C (98.0°F). Examination reveals acrocyanosis and a fixed splitting of S2 and grade 3/6 midsystolic murmur best heard over the left upper sternal border.\n\nAccording to [Adaptation of the maternal heart in pregnancy], during the second trimester, stroke volume increases slightly later than the heart rate and continues throughout this period. After delivery, there is a very early and dramatic reduction in volume loading followed by a return towards normal cardiac output.\n\nIn [Central circulatory responses in normotensive and hypertensive pregnancy], it is mentioned that haemodynamic responses in normotensive pregnancy in the antenatal phase show that cardiac output is elevated by the end of the first trimester, and remains elevated throughout pregnancy, although it may fall very slightly at the end of the third trimester.\n\nGiven these physiological changes during pregnancy, it seems likely that the increase in cardiac output is causing the change in this patient's condition. The symptoms of dizziness and dyspnea on exertion are consistent with an increased workload on the heart due to pregnancy.\",\n\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
