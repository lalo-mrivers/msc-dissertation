["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 39-year-old man with personality changes over the past year, becoming increasingly irritable, loud, aggressive, and impulsive. His wife also reports jerky movements of his limbs and trunk for the past few months. The patient appears restless with irregular movements of the extremities and twitching of the face and tongue. Mental status examination shows impaired memory.\n\nGiven the symptoms presented, it is unlikely that this patient has dementia or a degenerative condition typical of old age, as described in [The physical and behavioural complex of dementia]. However, the patient's family history with his father having dementia in his mid-40s raises the possibility of an inherited condition.\n\n[Abnormal involuntary movements in the elderly and their treatment] describes abnormal involuntary movements in the elderly, including tremors and dyskinesias. The patient's symptoms, such as jerky movements of the limbs and trunk, twitching of the face and tongue, are consistent with dyskinesias.\n\n[Clinico-epidemiologic study of the mental state of a group of elderly persons from the general population] highlights that not all mental disorders of old age come into contact with a psychiatrist. However, this patient is 39 years old, which means he is still relatively young and his symptoms are more likely related to an underlying neurological condition.\n\n[Disturbances of consciousness of old people from internal view (author's transl)] emphasizes the importance of immediate medical intervening in cases of unconsciousness, but it does not provide specific information about the patient's condition.\n\nGiven the patient's age, family history, and symptoms, the most likely diagnosis is Huntington's disease, which is an inherited disorder characterized by abnormal involuntary movements, personality changes, and cognitive decline. MRI changes associated with Huntington's disease include atrophy of the striatum (D).\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
