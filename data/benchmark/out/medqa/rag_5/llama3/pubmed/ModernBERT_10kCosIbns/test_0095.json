["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has a 10-year history of hypertension that remains poorly controlled on maximum doses of medications. He has flank masses bilaterally which suggests a possible renal issue. The creatinine level is elevated at 2.5, indicating kidney damage or disease. Given the family history of kidney problems and the patient's own symptoms, I suspect renovascular or renal parenchymal hypertension. Renal ultrasound was already ordered and the results are shown. To further screen for additional complications, I would focus on tests that could detect any underlying renal issues or systemic diseases. Given the high cost and low yield of some tests mentioned in the diagnostic evaluation article, I would not recommend routine investigations like IVU or renography at this point. Instead, I would consider laboratory tests that could provide more information about the patient's kidney function and potential underlying causes of hypertension.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
