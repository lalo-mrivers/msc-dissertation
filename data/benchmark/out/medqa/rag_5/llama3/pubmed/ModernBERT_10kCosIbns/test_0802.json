["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for the ages of three children based on their developmental milestones. The first child can lift his head and chest while prone, track an object with his eyes to the midline, and has yellow stools. This suggests an age around 1-2 months (based on the article 'Stabilization of the sick infant or child'). The second child can roll from supine to prone, transfer her rattle from hand to hand, but cannot yet say words. This suggests an age around 4-6 months. The third child has started taking independent steps at home and recognizes objects, but cannot follow a direction. This suggests an age around 9-12 months.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
