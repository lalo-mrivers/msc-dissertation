["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has a 2-month history of symptoms consistent with active tuberculosis, including cough, night sweats, and weight loss. The chest x-ray shows an opacity in the right upper lobe, and sputum analysis confirms the presence of acid-fast bacilli. However, the tuberculin skin test is negative. This suggests that the patient may be experiencing protein depletion due to their illness, which can impair lymphocyte function and lead to a false-negative reaction. This finding is supported by the documents 'Further observations on tuberculin reactions in active tuberculosis' and 'Stability of positive tuberculin tests: are boosted reactions valid?'.\n\nThe other possible causes listed (A-D) are not directly related to the patient's symptoms or test results, so it is unlikely that they are the cause of the negative tuberculin skin test.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
