["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has a shattered right calcaneus, which is treated with surgery and 11 screws. The relevant document [Fractures of the calcaneus. Orthopaedicotechnical management and long-term results following surgical or conservative first treatment (author's transl)] states that there was no difference in functional results between surgically treated and conservatively treated patients. However, it also emphasizes the importance of orthopaedicotechnical possibilities being utilized more often.\n\nThe patient has a lumbar fracture as well, which is relevant because [Lumbar spine fractures] suggests that early mobilisation in compressive lumbar spinal fractures can lead to good results.\n\nGiven these findings, the long-term post-surgery outcome for this patient will likely involve rehabilitation and physical therapy to regain mobility and strength in his foot. Therefore, we should look at the options related to the function of the foot.\", \n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
