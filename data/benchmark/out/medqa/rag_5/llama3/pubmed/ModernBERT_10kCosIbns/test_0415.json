["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Since we have a robust clinical trial with 100 subjects comparing the new screening test against the gold standard, we can calculate the sensitivity (True Positive Rate) and specificity (True Negative Rate). The table shows that out of the 45 subjects who have the disease, 45 tested positive. This is a high rate, indicating good sensitivity. On the other hand, out of the 35 subjects without the disease, 15 tested positive. This is a relatively low rate, indicating poor specificity. We can use these values to calculate the statistical power of the screening test.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
