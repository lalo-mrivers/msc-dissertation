["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is an 18-month-old girl with a cough that started this afternoon. She has a runny nose, low-grade fever, hoarseness, and a rough-sounding cough. She also has inspiratory stridor that worsens when she starts to cry. The frontal X-ray of the upper chest airways shows abnormalities. Considering the patient's symptoms and radiograph findings, I think the best step in management is to suspect an acute airway obstruction due to foreign body aspiration or a congenital anomaly. Therefore, the next step should be to get anterior-posterior and lateral radiographs of the neck (A) to rule out any anatomical abnormalities that may be causing the inspiratory stridor.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
