["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with symptoms consistent with rubella infection, such as a rash, nasal discharge, and mild knee pain. Her serology results show that she was previously infected with rubella and had IgG titers of 1:128 one year ago, which have decreased to 1:64 currently. However, her IgM levels are still negative, indicating that this is likely a secondary infection rather than primary infection. The patient's IgG avidity remains high, suggesting that she has developed immunity to rubella. Given the patient's symptoms and serology results, it is likely that she is experiencing reinfection with rubella. Therefore, the proper next step in management would be to diagnose and confirm the current infection through a fourfold or greater increase in IgG titer or demonstration of specific IgM antibodies.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
