["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has a history of diet-controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus. The laboratory studies show hyperuricemia (Uric acid 11.2 mg/dL) and hyperphosphatemia (Phosphorus 8.9 mg/dL). These findings suggest that the patient is at risk for developing acute tumor lysis syndrome (ATLS), a condition characterized by rapid release of intracellular contents, including uric acid, phosphates, and other substances from leukemic cells. The symptoms the patient is experiencing, such as nausea, vomiting, fatigue, and muscle cramps, are consistent with ATLS.\n\nThe most effective treatment for preventing ATLS would be to lower the patient's uric acid levels. Allopurinol is a xanthine oxidase inhibitor that can help reduce uric acid production and prevent its accumulation in the blood. Therefore, the correct answer is C: Allopurinol.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
