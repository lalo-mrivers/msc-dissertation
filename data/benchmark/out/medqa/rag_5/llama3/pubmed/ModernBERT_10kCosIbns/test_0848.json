["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient was camping outdoors in Texas with her two young children. She was awoken by something crawling on her hand and then noticed a wound on her hand that became painful over several hours. The lesion turned blue with a blackish discoloration at the center, suggesting a deep tissue injury. Given the physical examination findings of a bluish plaque with central necrosis surrounded by erythema at the dorsum of the right hand, it is likely that the patient was bitten by an animal that causes such injuries. According to the relevant document 'Hand injuries: incidence and epidemiology in an emergency service', 61.5% of patients presenting to the surgical section of our Emergency Services with chief complaints involving the hand had lacerations, and 5.2% were bites, with 8 of those being human bites. However, considering the patient's outdoor activity and the characteristics of the wound, it is more likely that the bite was caused by a non-human animal. Among the options provided, the brown recluse spider is known to cause necrotic lesions at the site of its bite.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
