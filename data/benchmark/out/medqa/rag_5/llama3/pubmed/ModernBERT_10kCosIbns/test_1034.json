["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has been recovering well from a rhinoplasty procedure. The whistling noise is present when she respieres through her nose. This suggests that the nasal airflow may be altered. The external rhinoplasty approach provides enhanced exposure for surgery of both soft tissues and supportive architecture of the nose, which indicates that the nasal septum and valve areas were likely affected during the procedure. Acoustic rhinometry can measure cross-sectional areas of the upper airway, including the nasal cavity. It is possible that a deviated septum has been straightened or corrected during the procedure, leading to altered nasal airflow and the whistling noise.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
