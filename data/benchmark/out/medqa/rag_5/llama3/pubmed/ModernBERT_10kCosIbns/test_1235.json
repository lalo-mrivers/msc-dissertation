["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the probability of the child having the disease of interest. The mother has a disease that leads to recurrent upper respiratory infections throughout her life. The father does not have this disease phenotype and comes from a population where the prevalence is 1/100. Since the father does not have the disease, we only need to consider the risk from the mother.\n\nThe question can be rephrased as: What is the chance that the child inherits the recessive allele from the mother? The mother has two alleles for the disease gene (one from each parent). Let's call one 'd' and the other 'D'. She inherited the 'd' allele from her parents. So, she has a genotype of 'dd'.\n\nThe father is not affected by the disease, so he can be either 'DD', 'Dd', or 'dd'. Since the father does not have the disease phenotype, we assume he is either 'DD' or 'Dd'. If the father is 'DD', then the child will always inherit a 'D' allele from him. So, if the mother is 'dd' and the father is 'DD', the child will be 'Dd'.\n\nIf the father is 'Dd', then the child can either inherit a 'D' or 'd' allele from him. In this case, the child can have a genotype of 'Dd' or 'dd'. Since the mother has two 'd' alleles, the child will always have at least one 'd' allele.\n\nSo, considering only the mother's contribution, the possible genotypes for the child are 'Dd' and 'dd', both having at least one 'd' allele. The probability of the child having the disease is equivalent to the probability of inheriting two 'd' alleles (which is 1/4) or one 'd' and one 'D' allele (which is 2/4), which equals 3/4.\n\nThe correct answer choice is A: 9/100. However, please note that the given choices do not accurately reflect the probability calculated.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
