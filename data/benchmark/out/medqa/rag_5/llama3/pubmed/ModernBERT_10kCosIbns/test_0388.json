["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is an 8-week-old male who has been breastfed since birth. He regurgitates breastmilk through his nose and mouth after some feeds, which has reduced in frequency after the mother limited the volume of each feed. The patient's physical exam is normal with no signs of infection or malnutrition.
