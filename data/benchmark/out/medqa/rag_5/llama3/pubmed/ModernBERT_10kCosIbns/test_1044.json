["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the development of naïve T cells (TH0) into a specific subset due to infection. We need to analyze the relevant documents. The first document compares immune responsiveness in different mouse strains and does not provide information related to human T cell subsets or pediatric health. The second document characterizes human T cells repopulating SCID mice, which is also not relevant to this question. The third document provides age-normal values for T-cell subpopulations in pediatric healthy children, but does not discuss infections or the development of specific T-cell subsets. The fourth document discusses extrathymic T cell tolerance due to differential expression of self antigen, which is not related to this patient's condition. Therefore, we need to focus on the last document, which investigates genetic 'risk' for atopy and its association with delayed postnatal maturation of T-cell competence.\n\nThe study finds that in normal children, gamma IFN-producing capacity of CD4+ T-cell clones is high, while IL-4 production is moderate. However, in genetically at-risk children, both capacities are low. Since the patient in this case has a positive scotch tape test and mebendazole is prescribed for pinworms, it suggests that the infection is likely due to pinworms.\n\nConsidering that the child is 4 years old, it is more likely that his immune system is still maturing, which may be influenced by the genetic 'risk' factor. Therefore, we can infer that the naïve T cells (TH0) are developing into TH2 cells, as this subset is associated with allergic responses and is less mature than TH1 cells.\n\n\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
