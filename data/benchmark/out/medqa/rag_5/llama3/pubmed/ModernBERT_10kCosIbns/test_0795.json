["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the most likely explanation for decreased concentrations of arginine in vascular endothelial cells. We can look at the relevant documents to find information on arginine and its role in the vasculature.\n\nIn 'Dilator actions of arginine in human peripheral vasculature', we see that L-arginine is the physiological precursor for the formation of endothelium-derived nitric oxide. This suggests that decreased concentrations of arginine may be related to a decrease in nitric oxide production.\n\nIn 'Nitric oxide participation in renal hemodynamic effect of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor lisinopril', we see that NG-nitro-L-arginine (NArg) reversed the increase in renal blood flow caused by lisinopril, suggesting that NO plays an important role in the renal hemodynamic effect of lisinopril.\n\nIn 'Effect of an arginine analogue on acetylcholine-induced coronary microvascular dilatation in dogs', we see that L-NMMA constricted small arterioles and partially inhibited the vasodilatation caused by ACh, suggesting that NO is involved in the regulation of blood flow.\n\nBased on this information, it seems likely that decreased concentrations of arginine may be related to a decrease in nitric oxide production, which could affect blood flow and pressure.\", \n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
