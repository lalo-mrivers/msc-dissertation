["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Since the patient reported significant neck pain, it's essential to consider potential spinal cord injuries. The most relevant studies suggest that seat belts can reduce the severity of injuries. However, the current case doesn't provide information about whether the patient was wearing a seat belt or not. Nevertheless, in motor vehicle accidents, penetrating eye injuries are less common after the introduction of compulsory seat belt use (1972). This indicates that the injury patterns might be influenced by the presence and proper usage of seat belts. Given this uncertainty, a thorough assessment is required to determine the patient's best course of action.\n\nThe provided studies indicate that correctly used seat belts can prevent up to 70% of head injuries, which are often mortal. Injuries to the thorax, abdomen, and extremities also occur frequently. Considering the patient's reported neck pain, it's essential to evaluate potential cervical spine injuries.\n\nA lateral cervical film is necessary to assess the integrity of the spinal cord. This is the most appropriate next step upon presentation to the emergency room.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
