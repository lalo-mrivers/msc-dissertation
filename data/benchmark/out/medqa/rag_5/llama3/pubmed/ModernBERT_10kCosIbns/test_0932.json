["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with bilateral knee pain that worsens with activity and is alleviated by rest. He has minimal morning stiffness, tenderness on palpation of the medial aspect of both knees, crepitus, decreased range of motion, cool joints to touch, and bony enlargement. This suggests an inflammatory process or degenerative joint disease. Given the patient's age and symptoms, radiographic knee osteoarthritis (OA) is a likely possibility. The studies done in 'Correlates of knee pain among US adults with and without radiographic knee osteoarthritis' suggest that nonradiographic correlates of self-reported knee pain are independent of whether a person has radiographic knee OA. Therefore, further work-up would focus on the knee joint rather than systemic causes.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
