["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"After reviewing the relevant documents, I see that monoclonal plasma cells are a type of B cell. In 'Stimulating capacity of human lymphoid cell subpopulations', it is mentioned that B cells were found to be strongly stimulatory. This suggests that monoclonal plasma cells, as B cells, should have similar characteristics. In 'Functional analysis of lymphoid cells from mouse bone marrow in vitro', pre-B cells are described as responding to LPS but having no ADCC activity. As monoclonal plasma cells are a type of B cell, they would likely behave similarly. Therefore, the immune cells that lyse abnormal cells without the need for opsonization, priming, or prior activation would be Natural Killer (NK) cells, which are responsible for eliminating abnormal cells. This is further supported by the fact that class I major histocompatibility molecules are downregulated in these monoclonal plasma cells, as NK cells recognize and target cells with altered MHC I expression.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
