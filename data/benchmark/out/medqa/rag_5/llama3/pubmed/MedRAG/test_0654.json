["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is an 18-year-old girl who has not menstruated yet. She has no previous medical records. Her physical examination reveals breast development, pubic hair, and axillary hair at Tanner stage 5, which suggests normal puberty. However, her FSH levels are low (7 mIU/mL), indicating a lack of ovulation. The estradiol level is also low (28 pg/mL). The testosterone level is within the normal range (52 ng/dL). Considering these hormonal values and physical examination findings, it's likely that this patient has a primary amenorrhea rather than a secondary amenorrhea. The most plausible cause of primary amenorrhea in this case is probably Muellerian agenesis.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
