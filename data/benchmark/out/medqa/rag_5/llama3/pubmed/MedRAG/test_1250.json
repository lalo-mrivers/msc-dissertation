["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's CD4 count has decreased despite ongoing treatment. This suggests that the current regimen is not effective in controlling HIV replication. The new drug should target viral DNA synthesis without undergoing intracellular phosphorylation, which is a characteristic of zidovudine (ZDV). We know from the relevant documents that ZDV does not decrease the levels of HIV DNA in PBMCs and has been used as part of combination antiretroviral therapy to treat early HIV infection. Therefore, the most likely drug to be added to the patient's regimen is a drug that acts by preventing viral DNA synthesis without undergoing intracellular phosphorylation, such as ZDV.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
