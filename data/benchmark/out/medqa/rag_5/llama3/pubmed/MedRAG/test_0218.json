["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient develops type I hypersensitivity-mediated histamine release, resulting in pruritic wheals on the skin. This is a classic presentation of urticaria. Urticaria is characterized by a rapid onset of edema and redness of the skin, often accompanied by itching. Histamine released from mast cells leads to vasodilation and increased permeability of blood vessels, causing the characteristic wheal lesions. Given this information, we can focus on the relevant documents about urticaria. The first document mentions allergic contact dermatitis, drug eruption, urticaria, and erythema multiforme as examples of how the epidermis reacts to foreign antigens. Urticaria is one of these reactions. The second document discusses a patient who developed an immediate urticarial reaction to cinnamaldehyde. This reaction was also observed in three out of eight control persons. Laboratory investigations revealed cinnamaldehyde to have a histamine liberating effect. The fourth document describes a case of episodic angioedema with eosinophilia, which is characterized by the presence of urticarial papules. Given these findings, we can conclude that the patient's lesions are likely to show histologic changes in the dermis.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
