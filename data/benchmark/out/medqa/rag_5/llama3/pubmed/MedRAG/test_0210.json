["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The retinoblastoma (Rb) gene product regulates progression through the G1 phase of the cell cycle. When Rb is phosphorylated in mid-G1 phase, it inhibits progression into S phase. Since drug X activates cyclin-dependent kinase 4, which phosphorylates Rb, we can infer that Rb will be phosphorylated and progress into S phase. Therefore, the distribution of cell cycle phase measured after 1 hour would show an increase in cells in G1 phase.\",\n\"answer_choice\": A"]
