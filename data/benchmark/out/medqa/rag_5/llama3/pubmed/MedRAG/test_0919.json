["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with radiating leg pain, which is a common symptom of nerve compression. The fact that the pain travels down his leg and feels 'electrical' suggests that this may be a neurological problem.

The choice that is most likely to help confirm the diagnosis is B: Straight leg raise.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
