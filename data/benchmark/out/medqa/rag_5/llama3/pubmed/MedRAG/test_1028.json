["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with a painless swelling over his right leg, which is well-circumscribed and non-tender. The swelling has been increasing in size over the last 6 months. Given the benign nature of lipomas, it's unlikely that this patient's tumor would be a lipoma. The pathologist reports that the tumor is actually a liposarcoma. Liposarcomas are rare tumors that can arise from adipose tissue, and they can have different histopathologic types (well-differentiated, myxoid, round-cell, or pleomorphic). Since the patient's tumor is a liposarcoma, we should focus on identifying enzymes that are commonly found in these tumors. Telomerase is an enzyme that is often overexpressed in cancer cells, including those of liposarcomas.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: Telomerase\"\n}"]
