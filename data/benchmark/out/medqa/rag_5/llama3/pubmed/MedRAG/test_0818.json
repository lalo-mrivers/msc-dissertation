["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has a history of recurrent fetal loss (4 miscarriages) and systemic lupus erythematosus with previous DVTs and pulmonary embolism. This increases the risk of thrombotic events during pregnancy. The question asks about treatments to prevent fetal loss. Aspirin is often used in combination with heparin or warfarin to prevent clotting. Rivaroxaban is an oral anticoagulant that may be used for DVT prevention, but it's not commonly used in pregnancy due to concerns about embryonic development and birth defects.\n\nConsidering the patient's history of recurrent miscarriage and thrombotic events, the most appropriate management would be to use a combination of aspirin and heparin (A or B) to prevent clotting and reduce the risk of fetal loss.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
