["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The primary endpoint is death from cardiac causes. From the study results, we see that there were 134 deaths in the medication 1 arm and 210 deaths in the medication 2 arm. The p-value is 0.03, which suggests a statistically significant difference between the two groups. To calculate the NNT, we need to divide the number of patients needed to show an effect by the absolute risk reduction (ARR). In this case, the ARR is the proportion of deaths in the medication 2 arm minus the proportion of deaths in the medication 1 arm. We can estimate the ARR as follows: (210 - 134) / 1500 = 0.038 or approximately 3.8%. To calculate the NNT, we need to divide the absolute risk reduction by the p-value. This gives us a rough estimate of the number needed to treat.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
