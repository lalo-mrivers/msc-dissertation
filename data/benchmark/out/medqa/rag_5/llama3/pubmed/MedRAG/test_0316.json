["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has a history of depression, binge eating and purging behavior, which may indicate a risk factor for suicide. However, there is no evidence of suicidal ideation at present. We need to consider the patient's past experience with therapy and potential side effects of medications.\n\nReviewing the documents, we find that one of them discusses drug-induced depression and attempted suicide. This suggests that some medications may have a negative impact on patients who are already prone to depression or have experienced depression in the past.\n\nAnother document discusses problems in family practice: the suicidal patient. It highlights the importance of viewing suicide as a final common pathway of system dysfunction at any or all major levels, including biological, psychological, sociocultural, and emphasizes that persons depressed for any significant length of time are potentially suicidal.\n\nConsidering these points, we need to choose a medication that is unlikely to induce depression or worsen existing depressive symptoms. One option stands out: trazodone, which is not typically used as an antidepressant but rather as a sleep aid or anti-anxiety medication. This suggests that it may be the safest choice for this patient.\n\nTherefore, we should avoid treatment with Trazodone (D).\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
