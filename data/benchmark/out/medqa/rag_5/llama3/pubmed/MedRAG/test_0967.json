["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 16-year-old girl who came to the emergency department with left wrist pain and swelling after falling on an outstretched hand while playing basketball. The initial thought is that it could be a traumatic injury or possibly a ligament sprain. Since X-rays show no abnormalities, further evaluation is needed. Considering the patient's age, the most likely cause of wrist pain in this scenario is probably a Scaphoid fracture.
