["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has a 2-year history of pelvic pain, irritative voiding symptoms, and occasional frank blood in his semen with painful ejaculation. He has been evaluated by several practitioners, who have all prescribed antimicrobial therapy without improvement. The physical examination is unremarkable except for a mildly tender prostate. Additionally, the patient has recurrent abdominal pain, periods of constipation and diarrhea, and fatigability. The urine test shows white cells in the expressed prostatic secretion but not in the mid-stream urine. This suggests that the inflammation is localized to the prostate. Considering these symptoms and findings, benign prostatic hyperplasia can be ruled out as it typically presents with a palpable prostate nodule or mass. Interstitial cystitis can also be excluded as it typically presents with frequency, urgency, and pelvic pain without evidence of blood in the semen. Chronic prostatitis by resistant Escherichia coli is unlikely given that antimicrobial therapy has not provided relief. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is chronic non-bacterial prostatitis.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
