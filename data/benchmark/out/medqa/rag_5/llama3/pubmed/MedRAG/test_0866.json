["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is an 11-month-old male infant who was born vaginally at 39 weeks. He has met developmental milestones and is up to date on vaccinations. His mother reports that he had an injury 2 days ago, which led to swelling and bruising of his right leg. The patient is now unable to stand or crawl and cries when putting weight on the affected leg. Physical examination reveals blue-grayish discoloration of the sclerae, joint hypermobility, and decreased tone in both upper and lower extremities. X-ray shows an incomplete fracture of the right tibial diaphysis. The patient's vital signs are abnormal with a blood pressure of 80/40 mm Hg, heart rate of 137/min, respiratory rate of 25/min, and temperature of 36.7°C (97.0°F). Respiratory, cardiovascular, and abdominal examinations are within normal limits for his age.\n\nConsidering the patient's history, physical examination findings, and laboratory results, the most likely cause of the patient's symptoms is adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to a lung injury, which was exacerbated by the recent trauma to the right leg. This is supported by the abnormal vital signs, particularly the low blood pressure and tachypnea.\n\nThe other options are not directly related to the patient's symptoms or laboratory results:\n\n* Option A refers to insufficient production of procollagen type 1, which is a condition typically seen in Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) patients. While EDS can cause joint hypermobility and skin hyperextensibility, it is unlikely to cause ARDS.\n* Options B and C are genetic conditions that can cause connective tissue disorders, but they are not directly related to the patient's symptoms or laboratory results.\n\nTherefore, the most likely cause of the patient's symptoms is adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to a lung injury.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
