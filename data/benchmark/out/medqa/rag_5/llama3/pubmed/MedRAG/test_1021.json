["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient had a fever and chills two hours after an elective cholecystectomy. She received cephalexin for antibiotic prophylaxis and one unit of packed red blood cells during the procedure. Her medical history includes hypertension treated with lisinopril and a hysterectomy 9 years ago. The examination shows a mildly tender abdominal wound without erythema, clear lungs, and no cardiac abnormalities. Considering the patient's symptoms and history, I think step-by-step that it is unlikely to be an adverse effect of medication, as cephalexin is typically well-tolerated. Malignant hyperthermia is also unlikely, as there are no reported cases of this condition occurring in this context. The presence of fever and chills suggests a possible infection, but the abdominal wound examination does not suggest erythema or significant inflammation, making urinary tract infection less likely. Given that the patient received blood transfusion, a transfusion reaction is a plausible possibility.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
