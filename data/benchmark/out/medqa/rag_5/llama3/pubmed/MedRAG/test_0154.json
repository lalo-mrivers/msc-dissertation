["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 4-year-old boy with a generalized rash for 3 days, severe itching, fever, headache, and muscle pain. He recently returned from a camping trip and attends a daycare center. The skin examination shows macules, papules, crusted lesions, and fluid-filled vesicles over the face, trunk, and extremities. Given the patient's symptoms and physical findings, we can consider infections that are common in children. Measles is unlikely due to the lack of cervical lymphadenopathy. Urushiol-induced dermatitis is also less likely given the rash's characteristics. Rubella is a possibility but it usually causes a more severe fever and arthralgias. Chickenpox, also known as varicella, is a common childhood infection that typically presents with a generalized rash, fever, headache, and itching. The patient's symptoms and physical findings are consistent with chickenpox.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
