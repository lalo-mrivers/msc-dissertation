["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Since the patient's fasting blood glucose level is 120 mg/dL which is higher than normal range (normal fasting blood sugar levels can be achieved and maintained in many, possibly most, diabetics who need insulin by basing dosage on currently available clinical-laboratory and home-monitoring techniques), it implies that she may have impaired carbohydrate tolerance. Also, her two-hour post 75g glucose load blood glucose level is 190 mg/dL which suggests some degree of glucose intolerance. Therefore, the patient's condition can be considered as prediabetes or at risk of developing diabetes. Insulin sensitivity needs to be increased in this patient. Among the options, Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARÎ³) is known to increase insulin sensitivity.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
