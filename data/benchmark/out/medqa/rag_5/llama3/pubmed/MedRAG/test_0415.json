["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to calculate the sensitivity and specificity of the new screening test. The table provided gives us the number of true positives (45), false positives (15), true negatives (35) and false negatives (5). From these numbers, we can calculate the sensitivity as TP / (TP + FN) = 45 / (45 + 5) = 0.9. We can also calculate the specificity as TN / (TN + FP) = 35 / (35 + 15) = 0.697. Since the prevalence of the disease is not explicitly stated, we cannot directly calculate the statistical power of the test. However, we can say that if the sensitivity or specificity of the test were increased, the statistical power would also increase. Therefore, options C and D are correct. Option A is incorrect because increasing the sensitivity or specificity of the test would indeed affect its statistical power.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C/D\"}"]
