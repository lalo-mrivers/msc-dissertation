["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's behavior suggests avoidance of social interactions, making excuses to avoid parties and gatherings, despite a strong desire for a relationship. This indicates a significant anxiety or fear response to social situations. Considering the patient has been out of the house only a few times in several years, it is likely that her primary concern is avoiding overwhelming social situations. Given this information, we should look for a disorder characterized by avoidance behaviors and significant distress.\n\nThe medical history reveals essential hypertension, which could be contributing to her anxiety and avoidance behaviors.

Antisocial personality disorder can be ruled out as it involves disregard for others and a lack of empathy, which is not evident in this patient.\n\nAvoidant personality disorder is characterized by significant distress caused by fear of rejection or criticism, leading to avoidance behaviors. This best fits the patient's behavior, so we should choose avoidant personality disorder as the most consistent diagnosis.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
