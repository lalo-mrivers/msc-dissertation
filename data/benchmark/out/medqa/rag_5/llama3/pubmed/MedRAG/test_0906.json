["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with intermittent chest pain, palpitations, dyspnea on exertion, and weight loss. The physical examination shows an irregularly irregular rhythm, a grade 3/6 mid-diastolic murmur, diffuse wheezing, and bilateral rales in the lung bases. The echocardiogram reveals a left-ventricular ejection fraction of 40% and a mass in the left atrium. Given these symptoms and findings, it is likely that the patient has congestive heart failure with normal ejection fraction (diastolic dysfunction). The presence of a mass in the left atrium suggests that this may be due to mitral valve tumor or thrombus. The biopsy of the mass would likely show nonencapsulated groups of well-differentiated skeletal muscle cells, which is consistent with cardiac rhabdomyoma.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
