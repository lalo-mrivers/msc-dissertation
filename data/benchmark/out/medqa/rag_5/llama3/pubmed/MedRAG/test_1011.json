["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presented with symptoms of acute ischemic stroke, specifically global aphasia, right homonymous hemianopia, and hemisensory loss. The diagnosis was confirmed by non-contrast CT scan, brain MRI, and catheter cerebral angiogram. Tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) was given within 3 hours of presentation as treatment for the acute ischemic stroke.
