["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 3-week-old newborn with symptoms of poor feeding, irritability, and frequent vomiting. The vomitus is greenish in color and smells strange. He has small, low-set ears, a broad and flat nasal bridge, and a large space between the first and second toes bilaterally. The abdomen is distended. A rectal exam shows an explosive release of stool from the patient's rectum after removing the finger. An x-ray of the abdomen shows a section of dilated colon followed by a segment of colon without stool or air. Considering these symptoms, I suspect that the patient has a gastrointestinal condition. The case resembles a description in one of the documents: 'Frequency and weight of normal stools in infancy.' This document provides data on stool weights and frequency at different ages in infancy. Based on this information, I think the diagnosis is likely related to constipation or an abnormal bowel movement pattern. To confirm the diagnosis, I would focus on examining the rectum and colon more closely.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: Rectal suction biopsy\"\n}"]
