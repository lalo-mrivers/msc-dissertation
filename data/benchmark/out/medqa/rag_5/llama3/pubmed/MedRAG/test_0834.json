["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the most likely general anesthetic responsible for massive hepatic necrosis. The relevant documents mention deaths during operations or under anesthesia. One document mentions a study of 114 fatal cases due to intravenously administered narcotics, which could be related to general anesthesia. Another document reports on the incidence of deaths associated with anesthesia at Royal Prince Alfred Hospital from 1963-72. It's mentioned that more than half of these deaths occurred in association with major cardiovascular and neurosurgical procedures.\n\nGiven this information, we can focus on general anesthetics that were commonly used during this time period (1960s-1970s). Halothane is a general anesthetic known to cause liver damage and necrosis. It was widely used during this time period and had been associated with cases of massive hepatic necrosis.\n\nLidocaine, Midazolam, and Desflurane are not typically associated with liver damage or necrosis.\n\nTherefore, the most likely general anesthetic responsible for massive hepatic necrosis is Halothane.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
