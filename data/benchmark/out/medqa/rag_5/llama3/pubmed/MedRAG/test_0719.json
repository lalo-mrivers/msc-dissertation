["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the enzymes that would be absent in a subset of normal human cells with an elevated intracellular concentration of bisphosphoglycerate mutase. The bisphosphoglycerate mutase is related to purine and pyrimidine metabolism, as mentioned in the paper 'Purine and pyrimidine metabolism: pathways, pitfalls and perturbations'. This suggests that we should look for enzymes involved in these metabolic pathways. None of the options seem directly related to this pathway. However, one option stands out - Î±-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase. The paper 'Electrophoretic heterogeneity of 5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate synthetase within and among humans' mentions that different organs have unique electrophoretic mobilities, which is similar to the concept of enzymes being absent or present in certain cell types.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
