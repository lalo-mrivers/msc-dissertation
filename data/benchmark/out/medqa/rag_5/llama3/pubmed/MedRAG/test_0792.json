["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with difficulty initiating sleep and frequent nighttime awakenings. She also reports daytime fatigue, mistakes at her office job, and inability to concentrate. These symptoms suggest that the insomnia may be related to a psychiatric or physical condition rather than just being due to primary sleep disorder. The treatment of insomnia is essentially that of the primary condition. Since the patient's symptoms also include daytime impairment, which is not typically seen in primary sleep disorders, it is likely that her insomnia is related to an underlying condition. Therefore, hypnotics have a limited role and their use should always be carefully considered.
