["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has been involved in a shooting and presents with multiple abrasions over the arms and thorax. The patient is intubated and mechanically ventilated. There are no abnormalities on cardiopulmonary examination, but there is mild opacification of the right lower lobe on chest X-ray. Given that the patient has respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) due to a gunshot wound, it is likely that the RDS is not caused by adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
