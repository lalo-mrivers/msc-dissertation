["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 22-year-old woman with severe headache, transient vision loss, blurry vision, and tinnitus. She has had episodic headaches before but this one is different due to the visual symptoms and tinnitus. Considering her past medical history of headaches, obesity, polycystic ovarian syndrome, and constipation, it's unlikely that the headache is related to those conditions. The initial head CT was normal, so a structural brain abnormality is less likely. The patient's age and clinical presentation suggest that the headache could be due to a vascular or neurological disorder. The patient's symptoms are concerning for a possible subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). SAH can cause severe headache, visual disturbances, and tinnitus.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C\n}"]
