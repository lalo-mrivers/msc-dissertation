["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has type 2 diabetes and was previously diagnosed with numbness in both hands and feet. His HbA1C is 8.5% and serum glucose is 240 mg/dL, indicating that his current treatment regimen (metformin and lifestyle modifications) is not effectively controlling his blood sugar levels. Based on the patient's symptoms and lab results, adding a sulfonylurea could be considered as an option. However, according to the document 'Oral hypoglycemic agents', sulfonylureas are indicated for symptomatic maturity-onset diabetes or excessive hyperglycemia--fasting blood sugar over 300 mg per 100 ml--in the elderly patient who cannot or will not take insulin. Since this is a 57-year-old patient with asymptomatic maturity-onset diabetes, adding a sulfonylurea may not be the best option.\", \"answer_choice\": C}"]
