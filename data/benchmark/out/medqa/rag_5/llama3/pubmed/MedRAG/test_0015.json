["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with severe abdominal pain, back pain, nausea, and vomiting. Her past medical history is significant for recurrent abdominal pain due to cholelithiasis, and her father died of abdominal cancer at age 60. The CT scan shows a calcified mass near the gallbladder. Given these symptoms and findings, acute cholecystitis is a likely possibility. However, we need to consider other potential causes of abdominal pain in this patient. Abdominal wall tenderness is a useful sign in the acute abdomen, but the physical exam is unremarkable. The patient's history does not suggest any relation to food or intra-abdominal cause that would require immediate surgical intervention. Given her previous history of cholelithiasis and the CT scan findings, we should exclude gallbladder cancer as a possibility.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
