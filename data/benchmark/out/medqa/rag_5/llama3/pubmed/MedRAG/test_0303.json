The presence of headaches with photosensitivity and nausea every few months suggests that there might be an underlying hormonal imbalance. Ibuprofen relieves her symptoms, which is consistent with estrogen-related headaches. Additionally, the patient's family history of migraine headache in her mother and bipolar disorder in her sister does not suggest any specific diagnosis.\n\nReviewing the laboratory results, we see normal electrolyte levels, renal function tests, liver function tests, and normal hormone levels (FSH and estrogen) for a 16-year-old female.

PCOS is a common condition that can cause menstrual irregularities, acne, hair growth, and other symptoms. The elevated Ca2+ level might be a secondary finding in PCOS.\n\nThe patient's age, physical examination findings, and laboratory results do not suggest any of the options A, B, or C.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
