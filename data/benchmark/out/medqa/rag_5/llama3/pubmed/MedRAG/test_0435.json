["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with acute-onset shortness of breath, fever, and diffuse wheezes on chest X-ray. Based on the clinical presentation, it is likely that the patient has Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). The patient does not have a history of asthma or respiratory symptoms, but rather developed symptoms while repairing a plowing tractor, which suggests an acute insult to the lungs.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe patient's oxygen saturation is 97%, which is within normal limits. However, his fever and diffuse wheezes on chest X-ray are concerning for ARDS.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to the relevant documents, ARDS is a common respiratory problem with a wide array of precipitating causes and an overall mortality rate of more than 50%. Signs on physical examination tend to be nonspecific as do laboratory findings associated with the syndrome.\\r\\n\\r\\nBased on this information, it appears that the patient has acute-onset ARDS. The most important factors in treatment are early recognition and early institution of therapy.\\r\\n\\r\\nGiven the patient's diffuse wheezes on chest X-ray, it is likely that his primary issue is related to gas exchange rather than bronchospasm. Therefore, bronchodilators such as albuterol may not be the most effective treatment.\\r\\n\\r\\nInstead, the focus should be on providing supportive care and using mechanical ventilator support if necessary. Inhaled ipratropium and oxygen may also be useful in helping to improve gas exchange.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
