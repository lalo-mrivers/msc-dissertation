["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The problem is about finding the fraction of GERD that can be prevented if alcohol consumption stops. First, we need to find the total number of people with GERD (both alcoholics and non-alcoholics). This is 30 + 30 = 60. Then, we need to find out how many of these cases are due to alcohol consumption. This is 30/200. Finally, by dividing this fraction by the total number of people with GERD, we can get the fraction of GERD that can be prevented.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
