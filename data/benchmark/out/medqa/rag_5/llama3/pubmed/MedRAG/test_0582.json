["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about a patient with severe abdominal cramping and bloody diarrhea after consuming undercooked ground beef. The relevant documents are the ones about gold-induced enterocolitis, symposium on diarrhea, possible mechanisms of action of antimicrobial agent-associated gastrointestinal symptoms, and pseudomembranous enterocolitis in adults. None of these documents seem to match the patient's symptoms, except for the possibility that it might be related to an infection or antimicrobial agent-associated gastrointestinal symptom. Considering this, we should look at the remaining options: Depolymerization of actin filaments in gastrointestinal mucosal cells, leading to mucosal cell death (A); Increased pH of gastrointestinal lumen resulting in reduced mucosal absorption (B); Increased intracellular cAMP in gastrointestinal mucosal cells, resulting in decreased absorption and increased secretion in the digestive tract (C); Inhibition of the 60S ribosomal subunit, resulting in decreased protein synthesis in gastrointestinal mucosal cells (D).\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
