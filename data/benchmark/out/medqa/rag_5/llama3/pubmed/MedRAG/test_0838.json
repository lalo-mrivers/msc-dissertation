["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 50-year-old woman with finger pain on her left hand. She is confused and can't remember when the pain started. Her daughter reports that the pain has been present for one month, and she also mentions worsening nausea for several months.

Hyperparathyroidism is more likely considering the X-ray findings, which show brown tumors and osteolysis.\",\n\"answer_choice\": A"]
