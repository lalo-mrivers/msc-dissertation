["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about a patient who has had a rhinoplasty procedure 3 months prior and now presents with a whistling noise when breathing through her nose. The relevant documents mention various procedures including rhinoplasty, resection of inferior nasal turbinates, secondary rhytidoplasty, and office evaluation of nasal obstruction. Rhinorrhea is also mentioned as a symptom that can be overlooked if an immediate crisis of airway obstruction is present. Considering the timeframe since the procedure (3 months), it's unlikely to be post-operative swelling or excessive columellar show. A septal hematoma causing a perforation is also not likely, as it would have been detected earlier. Therefore, the most plausible cause is the retraction of the nasal turbinates due to altered nasal airflow.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
