["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is presenting with neck stiffness and locking, which could be a sign of upper airway obstruction. The patient's past medical history includes asthma, which might make me think about acute wheezing. However, the patient's symptoms are more related to neck stiffness than respiratory issues.
