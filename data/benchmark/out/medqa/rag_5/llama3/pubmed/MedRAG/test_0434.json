["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with a 3-year history of increasing forgetfulness, initially mild but progressing to significant difficulties such as getting lost and forgetting his granddaughter. He is oriented only to person on mental status examination, suggesting a decline in cognitive function. The patient's daughter reports memory lapses, sleep disturbances, and social withdrawal.
