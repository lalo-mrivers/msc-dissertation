["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with bilateral joint pain, fatigue, subjective fever, and a sunburn on her face. She is an immigrant from Spain and works as an office assistant. The physical exam reveals bilateral redness over the maxillary prominences. Considering the clinical history and physical findings, acute rheumatic fever should be part of the differential diagnosis. Rheumatic fever is characterized by polyarthritis, carditis, and chorea, and it is commonly seen in individuals who have had streptococcal pharyngitis or scarlet fever.

The patient's fever and fatigue also support this diagnosis.\n\nThe other options do not fit well with the patient's clinical presentation.

The patient should be further evaluated to confirm this diagnosis.\",\n\"answer_choice\": A"]
