["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is experiencing insomnia with restlessness in her legs, which worsens at night. The symptoms resolve when she gets up and walks around or moves her legs. She has tried an over-the-counter sleep aid that contains diphenhydramine, which worsened her symptoms. Considering the history and physical examination findings, the main concern is probably related to exercise-induced leg pain rather than a primary sleep disorder. The patient's brother also has similar symptoms, suggesting a possible familial tendency.\n\nThe relevant documents suggest that somatic symptoms are common in medical patients, and in most cases, the diagnosis can be made using clinical methods without special investigations. Exercise-induced leg pain is a possibility, which may be related to psychological factors such as stress.\n\nPramipexole is a dopamine agonist commonly used for restless leg syndrome (RLS), which is characterized by an uncontrollable urge to move one's legs due to uncomfortable sensations. Given the patient's symptoms and the fact that her brother also has similar symptoms, RLS seems like a plausible diagnosis.\n\nThe other options are less likely: Amitryptiline is typically used for depression or anxiety rather than sleep disorders or exercise-induced leg pain. Codeine is an opioid analgesic not usually prescribed for insomnia or RLS. Escitalopram is an SSRI antidepressant that may be helpful in treating some somatic symptoms, but it is unlikely to be the primary treatment for this patient's condition.\n\nTherefore, Pramipexole seems like the most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient's symptoms.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
