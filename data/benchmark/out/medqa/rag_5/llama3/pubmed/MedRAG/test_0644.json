["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the mechanisms that contribute to changes seen at point D in the graph. The graph shows pH of stomach contents and rate of stomach acid secretions measured over 4 hours after eating a meal. Point D likely corresponds to the peak gastrin response, which was mentioned in the first document as being similar for three different meals, but larger with the largest meals. This suggests that point D is likely due to an increase in gastric acid secretion, which was also mentioned in the first document as being primarily related to feedback mechanisms controlling gastrin release.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
