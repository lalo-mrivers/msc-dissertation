["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms suggest an acute confusional state, possibly related to his previous medical history. The combination of confusion, memory loss, paranoia, hallucinations, myoclonus, and ataxia points towards a possible underlying neurological condition. Considering the patient's age, previous car crash, and corneal degeneration, I will rule out infectious causes like prions (C).
