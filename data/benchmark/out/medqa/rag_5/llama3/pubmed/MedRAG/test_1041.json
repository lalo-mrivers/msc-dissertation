["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms are concerning for a genetic disorder. The presence of intellectual disability, hyperactivity, aggressive behavior, and joint stiffness suggest a possible diagnosis of fragile X syndrome. Additionally, the physical exam findings of coarse facies, short stature, and joint stiffness also support this diagnosis. Since the patient has already been referred to a geneticist for further evaluation, we can focus on the molecular aspects of fragile X syndrome. The hallmark feature of fragile X syndrome is an expansion of a trinucleotide repeat in the FMR1 gene, which leads to the hypermethylation and silencing of this gene. This results in the accumulation of FMRP (fragile X mental retardation protein) precursor molecules. Therefore, the substance that would most likely accumulate in the cells of this patient is...\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: Sphingomyelin\"\n}"]
