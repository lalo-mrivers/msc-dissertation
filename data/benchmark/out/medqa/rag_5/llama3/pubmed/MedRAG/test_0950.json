["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the type of epithelium lining follicles in a normal thyroid gland. The provided documents mention several types of epithelial cells, including cuboidal cells, mucous cells, and ciliated cells. However, none of these are found in the given description of the thyroid follicles, which are lined by a single layer of cube-like cells with large central nuclei. This type of epithelium is similar to that found in the endometrium, as described in the document on cyclical variation in the percentage of ciliated cells in the normal human endometrium. Therefore, it is likely that the same type of epithelium is also found in another part of the female reproductive tract.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"]
