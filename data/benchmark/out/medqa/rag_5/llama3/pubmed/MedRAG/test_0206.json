["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the inheritance pattern of mutations in the CFTR gene. The presence of a novel mutation in addition to the commonly found Î”F508 mutation suggests that researchers are studying linkage between two loci. LOD score measures the logarithm of the odds ratio, which is used to determine the probability of two loci being linked. A higher LOD score indicates a stronger association between the two loci.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
