["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with pruritic rash on the left thigh, pubic region, and perineum, sparing the scrotum. Erythematous patches are a common feature of many skin conditions. The relevant documents suggest that cutaneous clues can be helpful in determining an accurate diagnosis.
