["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 65-year-old man who presents with changes in behavior over the past few months. He exhibits inappropriate behavior, memory loss, and difficulty caring for himself. His physical exam shows an elderly man who laughs inappropriately and has word finding difficulty. Given his age and symptoms, I think about possible causes of dementia. The patient's blood pressure is elevated at 162/103 mmHg, but there are no other clear signs of hypertension or related conditions.

Based on the symptoms and physical exam, I consider frontotemporal dementia as a possible diagnosis.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B\n}"]
