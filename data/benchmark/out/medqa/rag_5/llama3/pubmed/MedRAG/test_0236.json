["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 7-month-old male infant who develops severe sunburns every time he is exposed to sunlight. The condition is exacerbated by the child's corneas appearing irritated and erythematous, suggesting an ocular manifestation of a systemic disease. Considering the relevant documents, specifically 'Ocular manifestations of systemic childhood diseases', it is likely that the patient has a condition which affects the older population but can also be present in children. This would explain why common sunscreens do not provide relief. The child's symptoms are similar to those described in 'Fixed long ultraviolet eruption' where exposure to long ultraviolet radiation (UV) precipitates an itchy, erythematous, papular eruption with indistinct margins localized to particular areas on the exposed surface of the face. Given that the patient is a young infant and does not have facial lesions, it is more likely that the condition affects other areas of the body or has ocular manifestations.\n\nThis condition is also consistent with the 'Acropustulosis of infancy' where pruritic pustules are found primarily on the extremities of infants. The combination of sunburns and ocular irritation suggests a systemic disease rather than a primary skin condition.\n\nTherefore, it is likely that the patient has impaired nucleotide excision repair (A) which is a pathway responsible for repairing DNA damage caused by ultraviolet radiation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
