["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The laboratory is studying whether the ribosome can recognize a mischarged amino acid and still be incorporated into the growing peptide. The mischarged tRNA has valine instead of lysine. The mRNA sequence only contains codons for lysine, so the ribosome should expect to find lysine attached to the tRNA. However, it will actually find valine instead. According to the 'Leftward ribosome frameshifting at a hungry codon' document, when there is limitation of certain aminoacyl-tRNA species, phenotypic suppression can occur through ribosome reading frame shift. In this case, the ribosome may read the triplet overlapping the codon from the left or 5' side, followed by continued normal translation in the new, shifted reading frame. This would allow valine to be incorporated into the peptide despite being mischarged.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
