["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question describes a 23-year-old woman with a history of episodic headaches associated with dizziness, nausea, and vomiting. The MRI shows isolated dilation of the left lateral ventricle. This dilatation is most likely caused by blockade of a structure that affects cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow.

Therefore, it is likely that the dilatation is caused by blockade of arachnoid villi.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
