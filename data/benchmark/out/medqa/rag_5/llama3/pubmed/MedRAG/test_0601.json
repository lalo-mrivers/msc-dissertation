["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the pattern of glutamate release from presynaptic nerve terminals. We know that long-term potentiation (LTP) is a process where the strength of synaptic transmission is increased after repetitive stimulation. LTP can occur through postsynaptic mechanisms, such as increased NMDA receptor function or altered synaptic plasticity. However, we also know that glutamate release from presynaptic terminals plays an important role in LTP.\n\nOne of the papers provided discusses the regulation of glutamate binding by cations, including calcium ions. It suggests that certain divalent cations, such as calcium, can enhance Na-independent glutamate binding. This is relevant to our question because we know that LTP involves an influx of calcium into presynaptic terminals.\n\nAnother paper discusses quantal analysis and the release probability of neurotransmitters. We know that the initial setting of the presynaptic release mechanism determines the relative importance of pre- and postsynaptic changes in LTP.\n\nThe third paper discusses glutamate-induced long-term potentiation of miniature synaptic currents in cultured hippocampal neurons. It suggests that postsynaptic induction can lead to enhancement of presynaptic transmitter release, which is relevant to our question because we know that LTP involves an increase in neurotransmitter release from presynaptic terminals.\n\nPutting all these pieces together, it seems likely that the accumulation of calcium ions (D) is the event most likely to occur immediately prior to the release of neurotransmitters.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
