["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 4-week-old female newborn with increasing yellowing of her eyes and skin for 2 weeks. The mother has noticed that the girl's stools have become pale over the past week after switching from breastfeeding to formula feeds. Serum studies show total bilirubin of 15 mg/dL, direct bilirubin of 12.3 mg/dL, alkaline phosphatase of 2007 U/L, AST of 53 U/L, ALT of 45 U/L, and γ-glutamyl transferase of 154 U/L. The patient appears healthy with no focal neurologic findings. Considering the clinical presentation and laboratory results, we can rule out breast milk jaundice as it would have been present at birth or shortly after. The liver function tests suggest liver disease, but they are not specific enough to diagnose a particular condition. The patient's age and the presence of scleral icterus and jaundice point towards a neonatal hepatitis. Crigler–Najjar syndrome is an inborn error of bilirubin metabolism that typically presents with kernicterus, which is not seen here. Galactosemia can cause jaundice, but it would also be expected to cause other clinical features such as failure to thrive and neurodevelopmental delay. Biliary atresia is a possible diagnosis considering the patient's liver function test results and the presence of scleral icterus and jaundice.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
