["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with bright red blood in his stool, which occurred 2 times this week. He denies fever, weight loss, pain, pruritus or urinary symptoms. The clinical diagnosis of the causes of diarrhea is facilitated by considering three principal determinants: onset (acute or chronic), infection or absence of infection, and presence of blood or mucus in the stool. In this case, the patient has acute onset and presents with blood in the stool, but no mucus. Based on the clinical correlation of diffuse pulmonary opacities, patients can be classified into those with fever; those with no symptoms; those with cough, malaise and loss of weight, but no fever; and those with dyspnea as the main symptom. The patient does not present with fever or any other symptoms except for abdominal distension.
