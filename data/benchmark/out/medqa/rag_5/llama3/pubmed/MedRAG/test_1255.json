["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has a history of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) and presents with complaints of left eye pain and reduced vision. The patient's medical history is unremarkable except for SLE, which increases the likelihood of ocular manifestations. Given the sudden onset of left eye visual loss and the lack of any additional symptoms, I would focus on potential ocular complications of SLE. The article 'Rheumatic diseases and the eye' highlights that many systemic diseases have ocular findings that can be seen with flashlight illumination or a direct ophthalmoscope.
