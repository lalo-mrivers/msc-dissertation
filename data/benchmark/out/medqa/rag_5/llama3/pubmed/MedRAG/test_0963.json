["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's age is above 65 years, which indicates that he may have isolated systolic hypertension. The blood pressure of 90/60 mmHg suggests decreased total peripheral resistance and possibly increased cardiac output. The ejection fraction can be estimated based on the end-systolic volume of 80 mL and systemic vascular resistance of 35 mm Hg Ã— min/L. Comparing this information with the hemodynamics of elevated blood pressure in young hypertensives, we see that established hypertension is associated with an elevated total peripheral resistance, which is not present in this patient. Therefore, the ejection fraction will likely be higher than normal.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
