["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about preventing bias in the conclusions. The relevant documents are case-control studies that focus on screening activity in cases that occurs during an interval prior to diagnosis in which the cancer is believed to be detectable and still curable, and to a corresponding time period in controls. This approach places a heavy burden on the investigator to estimate accurately the period during which the tumor ought to be detectable using the test in question and to sort out reliably tests done in response to signs or symptoms of the cancer from screening tests per se. Therefore, we should focus on estimating the period during which the adrenal cancer is believed to be detectable.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
