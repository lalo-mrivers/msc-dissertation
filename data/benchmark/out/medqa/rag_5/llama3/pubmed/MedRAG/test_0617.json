["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The provided documents describe antibiotic resistance mechanisms for aminoglycosides. The scenario describes the isolation of Escherichia coli colonies after exposure to ciprofloxacin. Since ciprofloxacin is a fluoroquinolone antibiotic, it targets DNA gyrase. Therefore, we can infer that the surviving colony may have developed resistance through mutation of DNA gyrase.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
