["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To calculate the number needed to treat (NNT), we need to find the difference in cure rates between the study treatment group (Group 1) and the control group (Group 2). The cure rate for Group 1 is 190/250 = 76% and for Group 2 it is 165/250 = 66%. To find the NNT, we need to divide the difference in cure rates by the absolute risk reduction (ARR), which is the difference between the two groups. ARR is calculated as 0.10 (76-66). The NNT is then calculated as 25.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A: 25/250\"\n}"]
