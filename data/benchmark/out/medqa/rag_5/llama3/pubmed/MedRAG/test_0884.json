["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to the 'Distribution of newly formed ribosomal proteins in HeLa cell fractions' document, most of the newly formed ribosomal proteins are concentrated 10- to 50-fold in the nucleolus and two- to fivefold in the nucleoplasm. This suggests that the ribosome is primarily located in the nucleus or nucleolus. Additionally, since protein-secreting cells require targeted transport of proteins to the cell surface, it is likely that the ribosomes involved in glycoprotein synthesis are also found in the rough endoplasmic reticulum.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
