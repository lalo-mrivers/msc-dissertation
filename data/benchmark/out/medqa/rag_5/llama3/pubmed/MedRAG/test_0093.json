["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's past medical history includes mental retardation, hypertension, and diabetes. The physical exam is notable for symmetric swelling and deformities of the patient's hands bilaterally, as well as new onset spasticity with 3+ reflexes and a positive Babinski sign. Additionally, there is a 'clunk' when posterior force is applied to the head while anterior force is applied to the cervical spine. The abnormal head positions due to ocular problems are not directly relevant to this patient's condition. Upper airway obstruction is also unlikely given the unremarkable HEENT exam and normal facial features. Respiratory distress syndrome in adults is a possibility, but it would require further information about the patient's lung function and oxygenation status. However, considering the patient's mental retardation and physical deformities, adult respiratory distress syndrome is less likely.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
