["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms are episodic abdominal pain that lasts for a few hours, located in the epigastrium and radiating to his back. This is an unusual pattern of pain that does not suggest a surgical emergency or a typical cause of acute abdominal pain. The patient's mother is concerned about hereditary factors because his older sister has congenital heart disease. Given this information, I think it's unlikely that the patient has a life-threatening condition. Instead, I will focus on the patient's symptoms and look for congenital conditions that could explain his abdominal pain.\n\nThe patient's symptoms are consistent with hypertrophic pyloric stenosis, which is a common cause of abdominal pain in children. The pain is typically located in the epigastrium and can radiate to the back. Hypertrophic pyloric stenosis is a congenital condition that can be inherited, and it would explain the patient's symptoms.\n\nI will also consider other congenital conditions that could explain the patient's symptoms, such as biliary cyst or pancreas divisum. However, these conditions are less likely to cause episodic abdominal pain in an otherwise healthy child.\n\nGiven the patient's symptoms and the fact that he is otherwise healthy, I think hypertrophic pyloric stenosis is the most likely diagnosis.\",\n\"answer_choice\": A"]
