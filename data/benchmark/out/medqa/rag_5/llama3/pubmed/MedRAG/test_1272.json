["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with shortness of breath, productive cough, and radiographic signs of pulmonary hyperinflation. Given the history of heavy smoking, I will focus on lung function abnormalities. The FEV1 is 48%, FVC is 85%, and FEV1/FVC ratio is 56%. According to the documents, chronic airflow obstruction (COPD) is characterized by gradual decline in FEV1 over a lifetime, and even with cessation of smoking, lung function does not recover. Furthermore, COPD is often associated with decreased breath sounds and increased resonance to percussion on physical exam, which aligns with the patient's findings. Therefore, I believe the most likely diagnosis is Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD).\", \"answer_choice\": C}"]
