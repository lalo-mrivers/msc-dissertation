["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient experienced an acute drop in blood pressure during surgery with ST elevations noted in multiple leads. This resolved with adequate fluid resuscitation and numerous blood transfusions. The patient remained sedated after surgery and had relatively stable vital signs until his third day in the ICU, when he experienced an oxygen desaturation of 85% despite being on a respirator with 100% oxygen at 15 breaths/minute. Auscultation revealed air entry bilaterally with crackles, and a Swan-Ganz catheter showed CVP: 4 mmHg, RVP: 20/5 mmHg, PAP: 20/5 mmHg, PCWP: 5 mmHg. The patient died soon after this episode. The combination of hypoxia, bilateral crackles on auscultation, and Swan-Ganz catheter readings suggest a diagnosis of diffuse alveolar damage.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
