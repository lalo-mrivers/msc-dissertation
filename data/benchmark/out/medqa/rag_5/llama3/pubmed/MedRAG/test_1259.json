["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has fallen from his bicycle and presents with severe pain in the right shoulder, nausea, and limited range of motion. The examination shows swelling and tenderness over the clavicle, which suggests a possible musculoskeletal injury or trauma to the shoulder area. There is no neurological deficit or numbness in the upper limb, which further supports the idea that this is not an entrapment neuropathy. Given the acute nature of the presentation and the lack of clear radiological evidence, it's unlikely that imaging studies such as MRI would be useful at this stage. Surgical interventions like tension banding or arteriography are also not indicated in this situation. A simple shoulder sling can help alleviate some discomfort and provide stability to the affected area.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
