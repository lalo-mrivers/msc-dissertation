["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 26-year-old nullipara at 18 weeks gestation with complaints of fatigability and depressed mood. The thyroid profile shows TSH level of 0.3 mU/L, Total T4 of 160 nmol/L, and Free T4 of 13 pmol/L. These values suggest that the patient is euthyroid (normal thyroid function).
