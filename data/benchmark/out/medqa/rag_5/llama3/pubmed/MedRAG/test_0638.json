["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about preventing transmission of a gram-positive, anaerobic rod pathogen. According to the document 'Anaerobic infections', the treatment of anaerobic infection requires recognition of clinical signs and institution of antibiotics that are likely to be appropriate before culture results become available. This suggests that the pathogen is anaerobic. Therefore, sterilization with an agent that is effective against anaerobic organisms is required. According to the document 'Anaerobic infections', the treatment of anaerobic infection will be improved by having a high index of suspicion of anaerobic bacteria in all infections and institution of antibiotics that are likely to be appropriate before culture results become available. This suggests that the agent used for sterilization should be an antibiotic or an antimicrobial agent that is effective against anaerobic organisms.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
