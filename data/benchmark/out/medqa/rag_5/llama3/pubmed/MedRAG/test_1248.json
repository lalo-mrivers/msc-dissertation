["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with fatigue, fever, weight loss, and a non-productive cough. The physical examination shows mild wheezing and enlarged lymph nodes. A biopsy specimen of the cervical lymph node shows organized epithelioid histiocytes and multinucleated giant cells without focal necrosis. Based on these symptoms and findings, it is likely that the patient has a disease that causes diffuse pulmonary opacities visible on chest X-ray. The most common diseases that cause this are sarcoidosis, atypical mycobacterial infection, tularemia, and tuberculosis. Since the biopsy shows histiocytes and giant cells without necrosis, it is more likely to be sarcoidosis or atypical mycobacterial infection. Given the benign nature of sinus histiocytosis with massive lymphadenopathy, this can also be ruled out. Therefore, the most probable diagnosis is either sarcoidosis or atypical mycobacterial infection. The initial treatment should include a drug that is commonly used for these conditions.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: Prednisone\""]
