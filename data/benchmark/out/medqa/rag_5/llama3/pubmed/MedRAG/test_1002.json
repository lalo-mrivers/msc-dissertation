["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is 28 years old and has no previous history of medical problems. He presented with symptoms of dizziness and palpitations, which started 2 days ago after attending a bachelor party where he lost several drinking games. The ECG shows an abnormality. Given the age and lack of prior medical issues, coronary heart disease or ischaemic heart disease are unlikely. Ventricular tachycardia is possible but not the most likely diagnosis considering the patient's young age. Sick sinus syndrome can cause dizziness and palpitations, but it is also less likely in a 28-year-old man. Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation is the most plausible diagnosis given the symptoms and age.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
