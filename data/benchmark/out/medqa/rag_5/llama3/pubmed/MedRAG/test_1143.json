["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's brother died of heart failure at age 13, and his nephew has severe muscle weakness. Since the mother is not a carrier of the responsible mutation, this suggests that the disease is likely to be inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. The patient's being asymptomatic with no history of serious illness implies that he might be a carrier or have incomplete penetrance. Given the presence of cardiomyopathy and muscle weakness in his family members, it is unlikely that the patient would not be affected due to maternal uniparental disomy or gonadal mosaicism. Therefore, the most likely explanation for the patient not being affected is variable expressivity or incomplete penetrance.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
