["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has congestive heart failure with decreased ejection fraction. The patient's blood pressure is 80/50 mm Hg, which suggests that the diuretic Furosemide would be a good choice to treat the congestive heart failure. However, the guidelines suggest that in patients with normal ejection fraction, abnormal diastolic indexes should not be interpreted as diagnostic of diastolic dysfunction and are not an indication to treat. In this case, the patient's decreased ejection fraction is likely due to systolic dysfunction, so treatment for diastolic dysfunction would not be indicated. Therefore, the drug that should not be given to this patient is Digoxin, which is typically used in patients with normal ejection fraction.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
