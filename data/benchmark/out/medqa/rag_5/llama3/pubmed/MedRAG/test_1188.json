["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to the documents, TCR signals can inhibit the differentiation of precursor thymocytes into CD4+CD8+ cells. This suggests that selection might occur earlier than thought. Negative selection occurs before the CD4+CD8+ stage of differentiation. Positive selection is an important process during maturation of T lymphocytes and ensures the preservation of self-MHC-restricted T cells. The documents state that positive selection allows the maturation of only those T cells capable of restricted antigen recognition in the context of the host's MHC alleles. Therefore, it seems that positive selection occurs after negative selection and before single-positive CD4+ or CD8+ stages.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
