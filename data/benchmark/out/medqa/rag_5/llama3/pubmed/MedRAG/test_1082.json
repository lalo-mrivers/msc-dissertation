["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with itchy blisters in his axilla, which is an unusual location for most skin infections. The patient attributes the condition to a poor diet, but also mentions starting new medications. On physical examination, tense bullae are noted that do not rupture with light touch. Direct immunofluorescence shows linear C3 and IgG deposits along the basement membrane.\n\nGiven these findings, it is likely that the patient has an autoimmune blistering disorder rather than a bacterial or viral infection. The fact that the patient recently started new medications suggests that drug-induced hypersensitivity could be a possible cause.\n\nConsidering the location of the lesions, tense bullae that do not rupture easily with light touch, and linear C3 and IgG deposits along the basement membrane on direct immunofluorescence, the most likely diagnosis is likely to be bullous pemphigoid or cicatricial pemphigoid, both of which are autoimmune blistering disorders.\n\nHowever, given the patient's age and the fact that he recently started new medications, it would be helpful to further evaluate the patient for possible drug-induced hypersensitivity as a contributing factor.\n\nIn terms of the provided options, the most likely diagnosis is B: Bullous pemphigoid.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
