["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about a child suspected to have congenital hypothyroidism caused by inadequate maternal iodine intake. According to the documents, maternal mortality is unevenly distributed, and most maternal deaths occur in developing countries where the risk of maternal mortality is high due to lack of education, sanitation, accessible health care, as well as poor nutrition and poverty. This suggests that maternal iodine intake might be affected by these factors. Congenital hypothyroidism caused by inadequate maternal iodine intake would likely result in signs and symptoms such as hypotonia, macroglossia, and umbilical hernia. Diarrhea is not typically associated with congenital hypothyroidism.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
