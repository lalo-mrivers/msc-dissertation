["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, we need to calculate the total clearance of the drug using its bioavailability and half-life. We know that bioavailability is 50%, so the total clearance will be the dosing rate divided by the systemic availability multiplied by the biologic half-life. Next, we can use the volume of distribution and clearance to determine the initial dose needed to achieve a plasma concentration of 15 mg/L. Finally, we need to calculate the maintenance dose every 8 hours based on the patient's demographics and pharmacokinetic characteristics.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
