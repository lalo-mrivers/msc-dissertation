["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is experiencing muscle rigidity and is no longer responding coherently to questions. This suggests that the patient may be experiencing neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) or malignant hyperthermia (MH). NMS is often associated with the use of antipsychotic medications, but it can also occur in response to other medications such as anesthetics and anti-emetics.
