["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has a history of throat infection three months ago. The symptoms they exhibit now are painless subcutaneous nodules on the back of the wrist, the outside elbow, and the front of the knees, as well as inflammation in the joints of the lower extremities. Acute rheumatic fever is a possibility, given the patient's age and the presence of joint inflammation. In acute rheumatic fever, patients often develop characteristic lesions called subcutaneous nodules. This diagnosis is further supported by the patient's history of throat infection three months ago, as streptococcal pharyngitis is a common antecedent to acute rheumatic fever. Therefore, the symptoms are most likely related to rheumatic disease rather than other systemic diseases.\", \"answer_choice\": C}"]
