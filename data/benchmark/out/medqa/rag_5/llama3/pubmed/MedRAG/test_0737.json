["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is experiencing irregularly irregular heart rhythm, which could be due to atrial fibrillation. The initial treatment with IV digoxin causes the heart rate to drop from 125/min to 85/min and remain irregular. This suggests that the cardiac effect of digoxin has increased, as evidenced by the slowing of the heart rate. Quinidine is known to increase the serum concentration of digoxin, which is associated with an increase in the effect of digoxin on the heart. Additionally, a study found that reintroduction of digoxin after placebo treatment caused a shortening of left ventricular ejection time, suggesting that the inotropic response to digoxin is sustained during maintenance treatment.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
