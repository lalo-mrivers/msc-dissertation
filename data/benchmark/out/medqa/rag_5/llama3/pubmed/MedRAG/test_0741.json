["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the disinfectant used to ensure that instruments are free of Clostridium perfringens. Based on the provided documents, we know that necrotic enteritis is caused by Clostridium perfringens type A and its toxins. We also know that the researcher conducted multiple experiments to establish an infection and disease model for Clostridium perfringens in chickens. This suggests that the disinfectant used should be effective against bacteria like Clostridium perfringens. The documents do not explicitly state which disinfectant was used, but we can infer that it is a protein-denaturing agent, as mentioned in one of the documents.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A: Chlorine dioxide\"\n}"]
