["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 16-month-old boy who has not yet begun to walk. He is exclusively breastfed. His physical examination shows erosion of the enamel on the lingual surface of the incisors and carious molars, frontal bossing, widened wrists, bowed legs, and beading of the ribs.
