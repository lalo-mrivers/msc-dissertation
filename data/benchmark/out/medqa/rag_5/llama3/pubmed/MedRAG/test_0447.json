["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is described as having a temperature of 36.7°C (98.1°F), which is below normal. This suggests that the patient may be experiencing heat illness or heat stroke. The patient's physical examination shows decreased radial pulses, delayed capillary refill, multiple spider angiomata, and a distended abdomen, all of which are consistent with hypovolemic shock. The patient's altered mental status, including being oriented only to person, suggests that the patient may be experiencing encephalopathy.\n\nGiven these findings, it is likely that the patient is experiencing heat stroke or severe heat illness. Heat stroke can cause a range of physiological changes, including vasodilation and decreased cardiac output. This would lead to decreased systemic vascular resistance.\n\nThe patient's description of bloody and black-specked vomitus is not particularly relevant to this question, but may be important for further evaluation and management.\n\nIn summary, the most likely answer is that systemic vascular resistance is decreased in this patient compared to a healthy adult.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
