["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has intermittent episodes of heart palpitations for 3 weeks with accompanying chest pain localized to the left 3rd intercostal space. The pulse is irregularly irregular and blood pressure is normal. There are physical signs of hyperthyroidism such as fine tremor on both hands, digital swelling, retraction of the left upper eyelid, and systolic ejection murmur along the right upper sternal border. These findings suggest that the patient may have thyrotoxicosis.\n\nThe patient does not smoke and drinks one to two glasses of wine on the weekends, which is unlikely to be related to her symptoms.
