["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with leg swelling and right upper abdominal tenderness, suggesting possible pulmonary embolism. The history of myocardial infarction and smoking habit also point towards cardiovascular risk factors. The physical examination reveals jugular vein distension, bilateral lower leg pitting edema, and a systolic murmur on cardiac auscultation, which may be related to pulmonary hypertension or tricuspid insufficiency. Additionally, the patient's history of 'high blood sugars' and lack of follow-up suggest possible insulin resistance or diabetes.
