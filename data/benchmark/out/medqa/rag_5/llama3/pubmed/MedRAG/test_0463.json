["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has chronic obstructive lung disease (COPD) with a history of smoking. He is currently experiencing an exacerbation, which is characterized by a cough, breathing difficulty, and increased expectoration. The patient was a smoker but quit 2 years ago, which suggests that he may have irreversible airway obstruction. Given the patient's clinical presentation, we need to consider medications that can help reduce the risk of subsequent exacerbations.\n\nThe relevant documents suggest that COPD is characterized by chronic airflow obstruction, and smoking is the leading risk factor. Quitting smoking may not recover lung function but can prevent further loss of lung function.\n\nIpratropium bromide has been shown to have apparent benefits over beta 2 agonist therapy in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, including a longer duration of action. Montelukast is an antagonist of leukotriene receptors and may be useful in reducing the risk of exacerbations.\n\nIn this case, I would recommend montelukast as it has been shown to reduce the risk of subsequent exacerbations.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
