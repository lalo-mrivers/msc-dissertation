["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the effects of ATP2A1 gene mutation on muscle relaxation time and cytosolic calcium concentration. The key to this question is understanding how calcium regulates muscle contraction and relaxation. Calcium ATPase pump in sarcoplasmic reticulum membrane plays a crucial role in regulating calcium levels during muscle relaxation. When this pump is defective, as in the case of ATP2A1 gene mutation, calcium levels will not be properly removed from the cytosol, leading to increased calcium concentrations. This increased calcium can cause muscle stiffness and cramping after exercise or strenuous activity. In contrast, normal muscle relaxation time is regulated by the proper removal of calcium ions from the cytosol during relaxation phase. Therefore, ATP2A1 gene mutation will result in prolonged muscle relaxation time due to increased calcium levels.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B: Muscle relaxation time: increased, cytosolic calcium concentration: increased\"\n}"]
