["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The prevalence of CMV retinitis is decreasing due to increased access to antiretroviral therapy. This means that there will be fewer true positives (CMV retinitis cases) in the population. However, the sensitivity and specificity of the diagnostic test remain the same.

NPV increases because as the prevalence of CMV retinitis decreases, more patients without CMV retinitis will be correctly identified by the diagnostic test.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
