["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, let's examine the dose-response trial results. The percentage of patients demonstrating improvement at each dose level is increasing with the dose. This suggests a positive correlation between dose and response. Next, we can look at the safety profile to see how the treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) change with dose. We notice that the TRAE rate increases as the dose increases. Finally, we need to balance the response rate against the TRAE rate to determine the therapeutic index. A higher therapeutic index represents a greater difference between the dose levels with high response rates and low TRAE rates.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
