["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for the specificity of a PET radiotracer test. Specificity is defined as the proportion of true negatives (patients without PD) who are correctly identified by the test. We can calculate this using the given data: 20 patients without PD were incorrectly identified as having PD, so there are 580 patients without PD who were correctly identified as not having PD. Therefore, the specificity would be the ratio of these correct negatives to the total number of patients without PD (600).\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
