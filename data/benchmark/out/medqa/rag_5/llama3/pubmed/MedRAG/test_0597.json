["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Since the study is conducted to determine the most effective ways to prevent transmission of various infective agents, we focus on the disinfectants used for inactivating viruses. We see that hydroxylamine inactivates members of the orthomyxovirus group and it's mentioned that virus-specific prophylaxis is one of the most effective strategies for controlling and eradicating virus infections. Additionally, we find that the study aims to determine which disinfectant is most likely to inactivate this picornavirus that preferentially infects hepatocytes. Given these points, we consider whether any of the provided disinfectants have been tested or discussed in the provided documents as being effective against viruses similar to the one studied.\", \n\"answer_choice\": \"D: Ethyl alcohol\"\n}"]
