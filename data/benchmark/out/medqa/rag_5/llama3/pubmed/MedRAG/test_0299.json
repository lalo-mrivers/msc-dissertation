["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the resistance to blood flow in a vessel with occlusion, we need to understand how occlusion affects blood flow. According to the provided documents, occlusion causes a reduction in diameter, which increases resistance to blood flow. The document on coronary angioplasty states that a 50% reduction in diameter corresponds to a percentage diameter stenosis of 60.4%. This is similar to the scenario presented in the question, where there is a 50% reduction in diameter due to occlusion. Therefore, we can infer that the resistance to blood flow has increased.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
