["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the development of the 6-week-old girl's ovaries. Polycystic ovarian syndrome is a condition that affects women, so it's unlikely to affect the baby's ovaries at this stage. The mother's history of polycystic ovarian syndrome suggests that her daughter may also develop polycystic ovary syndrome, but it's not relevant to the question.\n\nThe fetus develops oocytes in the early stages of development, and by 6 weeks gestation, the oocytes are arrested in prophase. This is a normal stage of fetal development.\n\nTherefore, we can eliminate choices D (fully matured) and A (not yet developed).\n\nChoice B (arrested in interphase) is incorrect because oocytes are arrested in prophase during fetal development, not interphase.\n\nThe correct answer is C (the baby's oocytes are arrested in prophase).\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
