["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is being treated with an experimental analog of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP). According to the documents provided, ANP infusion decreased wedge pulmonary pressure, left ventricular end-diastolic pressure and increased cardiac output and left ventricular ejection fraction. Additionally, prolonged infusion of ANF caused reductions in central filling pressures, increases in cardiac output, modest increases in diuresis and glomerular filtration rates, significant reduction in plasma aldosterone levels... Therefore, the patient would expect to experience C: Increased glomerular filtration rate, restricted aldosterone release, vascular smooth muscle dilation.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
