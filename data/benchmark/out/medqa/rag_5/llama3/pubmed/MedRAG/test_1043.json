["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with a solitary nodule that is fixed to the surrounding tissues and non-tender. TSH is normal and antithyroid antibodies are negative. Iodine-induced thyrotoxicosis can cause a thyroid nodule to appear, but it subsides spontaneously within a few weeks or months after stopping high intake of iodine. Ectopic thyroid tissue in the neck can also cause a solitary nodule, but it is usually unsuppressible and presumably autonomous in its function. The patient has no relevant past medical history and normal vital signs. Therefore, I will rule out endemic goiter, Hashimoto thyroiditis, and papillary carcinoma as they are more likely to present with symptoms such as pain, swelling, or weight loss. Considering the absence of any underlying thyroid disorder, the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms is iodine-induced thyrotoxicosis.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
