The initial laboratory results reveal metabolic acidosis, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and a coagulation profile suggestive of disseminated coagulation. A peripheral smear was performed. The autopsy specimen from the lungs revealed gram-positive, lancet-shaped diplococci occurring singly or in chains. Given these findings, we can consider the three principal determinants of diarrhea: onset (acute), infection or absence of infection, and presence of blood or mucus.
