["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the case-fatality rate for hepatitis A outbreak. From the documents provided, we can see that there are discussions about hepatitis B, but no specific information about hepatitis A's case fatality rate. However, we have a similar discussion in the 'Viral hepatitis in the United States, 1970-1973' document where it is mentioned that 'case fatality rates for reported cases appear to increase with age'. We can assume that this pattern might also apply to hepatitis A. Therefore, we need to find the percentage of deaths among the incident cases (500 individuals) which is 5. The case-fatality rate will be the ratio of deaths (5) to total incident cases (500). This gives us the answer.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
