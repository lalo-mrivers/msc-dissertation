["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has achondroplasia with typical rhizomelic short stature, large head, frontal bossing and trident fingers. The height is around four standard deviations below the 50th percentile of the normal growth curve. The head girths are above the 97th percentile of the normal growth curve, but are normal in a special growth chart for achondroplasia. This description matches the clinical observation of achondroplasia.

Therefore, the physiologic process most likely disrupted is endochondral ossification.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
