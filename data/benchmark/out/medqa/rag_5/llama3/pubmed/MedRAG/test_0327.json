["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with swelling and pain in his right testicle, which suggests a potential genital or urogenital issue. The patient's history of fever and swollen face 10 days ago could indicate an infectious process. Considering the patient's monogamous relationship and lack of urethral discharge or painful urination, it is unlikely that the patient has a urinary tract infection. Spermolithiasis is not typically associated with symptoms in the testicle. Urethral syndrome in women is a diagnosis unrelated to the patient's symptoms.\n\nGiven these findings, the most likely diagnosis is Spermolithiasis, which can present as unilateral testicular pain and swelling, often accompanied by epididymoorchitis or orchitis. This diagnosis is supported by the patient's history of fever and swollen face 10 days ago, suggesting an infectious process that may have affected the testicles.\n\nThe other options do not fit the patient's symptoms:\n\n* Preventable by a live attenuated vaccine: Not relevant to this case.\n* Original presentation in the form of a painless chancre: This is more characteristic of syphilis, which is not supported by the patient's history or physical examination.\n* Cause buboes in the inguinal lymph nodes: While some sexually transmitted infections can cause buboes, this does not seem to be relevant to the patient's symptoms.\n\nThe patient most likely has Spermolithiasis.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
