["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with fever, behavioral problems, and elevated blood pressure. The patient recently quit drinking after being an alcoholic for several years, which may be contributing to his current condition. The patient's symptoms, such as feeling like bugs are crawling on his skin, suggest a possible delirium. Given the patient's elevated blood pressure, it is necessary to consider whether this is a case of hypertension or not. According to the document 'Elevated blood pressure in the young adult', patients with labile blood pressure (those who have occasional elevations in diastolic blood pressure) only require reassurance and follow-up, whereas those with consistent mild elevations should be treated.\n\nConsidering the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, it is possible that his elevated blood pressure may not necessarily be a case of hypertension. Therefore, treatment aimed at controlling blood pressure may not be the most appropriate initial course of action.\n\nThe patient's fever, behavioral problems, and altered mental status suggest a more complex clinical picture. Given the patient's recent quit from drinking and potential withdrawal symptoms, it is possible that his condition is related to alcohol withdrawal rather than hypertension.\n\nIn this case, a benzodiazepine such as Diazepam may be more appropriate for initial treatment due to its ability to calm agitated patients and manage anxiety.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
