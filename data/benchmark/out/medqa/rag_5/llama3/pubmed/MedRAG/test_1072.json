["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is presenting with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), specifically a fear of something terrible happening to his house if he doesn't check every appliance, outlet, window and door lock, faucet, and light fixture. The physician explains that cognitive-behavioral therapy may be helpful, but also prescribes clomipramine.\n\nClomipramine is an antidepressant medication primarily used to treat OCD. Its mechanism of action involves blocking the reuptake of serotonin by presynaptic neurons, which increases the amount of serotonin available to bind to postsynaptic receptors.\n\nThe other options do not accurately describe the mechanism of reaction of clomipramine:\n\n* A: Clomipramine does not decrease the degradation of norepinephrine and serotonin.\n* B: Clomipramine is an alpha 2 receptor antagonist, but it primarily affects serotonin reuptake.\n* C: Clomipramine blocks both norepinephrine and serotonin reuptake, not just one.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D: Blocks reuptake of norepinephrine and serotonin.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
