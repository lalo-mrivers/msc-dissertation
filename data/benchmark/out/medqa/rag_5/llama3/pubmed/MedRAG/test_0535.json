["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the increased standard error in the pulmharkimab 150 mg/day group. We need to find the explanation for this increased standard error. The documents provided are related to asthma and cardiovascular disease, but there is no mention of pulmharkimab or its usage in these studies. However, we can look at the provided abstracts and see if there's any relevant information.

This suggests that the increased standard error might not be related to the study itself, but rather to the pulmharkimab treatment.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
