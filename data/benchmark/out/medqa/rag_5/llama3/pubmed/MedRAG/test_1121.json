["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with periodic painful double vision when looking sideways. The symptoms occurred after a fall off her bike 10 days prior. A CT scan at that time showed no abnormalities. The patient has myopia and is taking oral contraceptives, but there are no other significant medical issues. The physical examination reveals bilateral disc hyperemia, adduction deficits in both eyes, and nystagmus in the left eye when looking left and in the right eye when looking right.\n\nAbnormal head positions due to ocular problems suggests that abnormal head postures can be caused by ocular problems such as incomitance. The patient's symptoms are consistent with incomitance, which is characterized by adduction deficits and nystagmus. Moreover, the bilateral disc hyperemia is a common finding in incomitance.\n\nThe paper on sudden nontraumatic visual loss suggests that abnormal head positions can be developed to maintain fusion. The patient does not have sudden nontraumatic visual loss, but the concept of developing abnormal head positions to maintain fusion could be relevant to this case.\n\nThe papers on ocular causes of abnormal head postures and a modification of eye-head coordination by CNS disease suggest that abnormal head postures can be caused by ocular problems such as incomitance. The patient's symptoms are consistent with incomitance, which is characterized by adduction deficits and nystagmus.\n\nBilateral optic nerve hypoplasia with normal visual acuity suggests that bilateral optic nerve hypoplasia does not typically cause painful double vision when looking sideways.\n\nIn conclusion, the most likely cause of this patient's findings is incomitance.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
