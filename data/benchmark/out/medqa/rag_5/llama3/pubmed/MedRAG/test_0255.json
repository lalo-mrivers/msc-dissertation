["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the phenotype of a patient with a known mutation in the Kozak sequence of the Beta-globin gene. The Kozak sequence is involved in translation initiation. A decrease in translation of the Beta-globin mRNA would lead to decreased synthesis of beta-globin chains, resulting in beta-thalassemia intermedia. This would be characterized by microcytic red blood cells due to an imbalance between alpha and beta globin chains. Therefore, the expected blood smear finding is microcytic red blood cells.\", \"answer_choice\": C}"]
