["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has recently developed brown greasy appearing lesions on his forehead that he can't seem to peel off. The lesions are described as 'brown' which suggests a benign condition rather than a malignant one like melanoma. Seborrheic keratosis is a possibility given the description of the lesions being 'brown and greasy'. Acanthosis nigricans is less likely given that it typically presents with darkened skin folds, not flat brown lesions on the forehead.
