["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has a history of ischemic stroke and is currently experiencing palpitations. The electrocardiogram (ECG) shows an irregular rate and rhythm. Considering the patient's history and current symptoms, we should focus on preventing future cerebrovascular accidents (CVAs). Mild hypertension was not mentioned as a factor in this case, so we can rule out that as a significant risk factor.
