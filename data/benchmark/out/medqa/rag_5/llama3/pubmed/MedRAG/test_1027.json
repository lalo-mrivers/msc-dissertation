["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To calculate the loading dose of heparin, we need to know the volume of distribution (Vd) which is given as 60 mL/kg. We also need to know the target peak plasma concentration (Cmax) which is given as 0.5 units/mL. We can use the formula: Loading dose = Cmax * Vd. In this case, we have Cmax = 0.5 units/mL and Vd = 60 mL/kg. We substitute these values into the formula to get the loading dose.\", \"answer_choice\": A}"]
