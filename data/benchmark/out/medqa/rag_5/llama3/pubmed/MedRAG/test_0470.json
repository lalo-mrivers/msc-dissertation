["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with a 1-year history of dysphagia for solids, which has recently progressed to dysphagia for liquids. He complains of food getting stuck in his throat, but does not experience pain while swallowing. The physical examination is unremarkable, and the swallowing study reveals a small outpouching in the posterior neck.
