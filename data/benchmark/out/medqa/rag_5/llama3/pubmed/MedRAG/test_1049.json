["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the process responsible for the development of symptoms of infection in animals exposed to the noninfectious isolate, after it was cultivated with lysed bacteria from the infectious isolate. Since the noninfectious isolate itself does not cause infection, and some animals develop symptoms of infection after exposure to this culture, it suggests that the infectious characteristics were transferred to the noninfectious isolate. This is likely due to a process that allows the transfer of genetic material from one bacterium to another. The key is that the noninfectious isolate did not become infectious on its own, but became so only after being cultured with lysed bacteria from the infectious isolate.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
