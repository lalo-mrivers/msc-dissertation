["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents highlight the importance of biopsy procedures in diagnosing pancreatic cancer. The Fine needle aspiration biopsy of malignant lesions in and around the pancreas document states that the procedure is simple, relatively painless, reasonably safe and reliable method of obtaining a preoperative diagnosis. The Early diagnosis of pancreatic cancer using ultrasound and fine needle aspiration cytology document emphasizes the value of ultrasonography as the first investigation in patients with suspected pancreatic cancer, followed by percutaneous fine needle aspiration cytology. Operative biopsy is also mentioned as a valuable diagnostic procedure. Considering these documents, I would think that it's essential to respect the patient's autonomy and involve them in decision-making processes regarding their diagnosis and treatment. However, if there are valid reasons why the patient should not be informed of the diagnosis, it's crucial to follow the patient's advanced directive or health care proxy's wishes.\n\nThe patient's daughter is requesting that the results not be shared with the patient, citing a discussion with her brother, the documented health care proxy. This raises concerns about the validity of the request and whether it aligns with the patient's best interests.\n\nIn this scenario, I would recommend involving the health care proxy in the decision-making process to determine how he would like to handle the situation. This would ensure that the patient's wishes are respected while also considering their well-being.\n\nTherefore, I believe the best response is A: Ask the patient's son, the documented health care proxy, how he would like to handle the situation.\",\n\"answer_choice\": A"]
