["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 25-year-old woman with cyclic vomiting for 3 days. She also complains of feeling tired, having the 'sniffles', and getting dizzy when standing up. Her vitals signs are pulse 120/min, respiratory rate 9/min, and blood pressure 100/70 mm Hg. Her eyes are sunken, and her tongue appears dry.

Based on these findings, the lab values should indicate a metabolic alkalosis with possible hypokalemia.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
