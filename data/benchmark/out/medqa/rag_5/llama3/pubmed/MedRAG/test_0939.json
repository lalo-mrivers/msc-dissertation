["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with fatigue, joint pain, and oral ulcers. The combination of skin lesions (erythema with scaling on both cheeks) that spare the nasolabial folds is concerning for sarcoidosis. Reviewing the literature on oral sarcoidosis suggests that it can present with asymptomatic swelling, but in some cases, may also cause oral ulcers and skin lesions. Considering the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, it is likely that she has systemic sarcoidosis.\n\nThe relevant document 'Oral sarcoidosis: review of the literature' discusses changes in the minor salivary glands under clinically normal-appearing mucosa in patients with systemic sarcoidosis. This information suggests that the patient's oral ulcers are part of her systemic disease, rather than a local oral condition.\n\nBased on this step-by-step thinking, we can conclude that the patient is likely to have decreased lymphocyte count, which is a common finding in patients with sarcoidosis. Therefore, the answer choice is A: Decreased lymphocyte count.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
