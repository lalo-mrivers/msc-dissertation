["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with central chest pain that is constant, unrelated to exertion, and radiates to his shoulders and neck. The pain increases when lying down and improves with leaning forward. A scratching sound over the left sternal border at end-expiration suggests a costovertebral joint dysfunction, which can cause referred pain to the shoulders and neck. Given the patient's symptoms and physical exam findings, I would consider this as a possible diagnosis. Costovertebral joint dysfunctions are often misdiagnosed as cardiac-related chest pain, but they can respond to simple therapeutic maneuvers.\n\nThe ECG shows no abnormalities that would suggest coronary artery disease or pericarditis. The normal chest X-ray also suggests that the patient does not have pneumonia or other pulmonary causes of his symptoms.\n\nBased on the information provided, I think the optimal therapy for this patient is Ibuprofen + colchicine +/- omeprazole (option B). Ibuprofen and colchicine are common treatments for costovertebral joint dysfunctions, and adding omeprazole may be helpful in case the patient has any underlying gastritis or peptic ulcer disease. Indomethacin +/- omeprazole (option A) is also a possibility, but I think option B is more specific to this diagnosis.\n\nPericardiocentesis (option C) and pericardiectomy (option D) are not indicated based on the patient's symptoms and physical exam findings, as there is no evidence of pericarditis or cardiac tamponade.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
