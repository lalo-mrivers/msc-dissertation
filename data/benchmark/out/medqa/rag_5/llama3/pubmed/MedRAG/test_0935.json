["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the given documents, I understand that an increase in leukocyte count is associated with a higher risk of major coronary heart disease events. Additionally, the document 'When outside the norm is normal: interpreting lab data in the aged' highlights that many laboratory parameters increase or decrease with advancing age. However, this information does not directly relate to the patient's presentation. Therefore, I will focus on the clinical features and laboratory results presented in the question.\n\nThe patient has a normal physical examination, vital signs are within normal limits, and her complete blood count shows an absolute increase in certain cells. Based on this information, I can conclude that these cells are likely to be leukocytes (white blood cells). The fact that there is an increase in leukocyte count without any specific complaints or abnormal physical findings suggests that the patient's condition might not be related to a severe inflammatory process.\n\nGiven the normal vital signs and physical examination, I would exclude the possibility of sepsis or other life-threatening conditions. Therefore, the most likely cause of the increased leukocyte count is an infection or inflammation that is not causing any significant clinical symptoms. However, this assumption does not directly answer the question about the specific characteristics of these cells.\n\nThe only relevant information from the given documents that might help in answering the question is the 'Diagnostic utility of white blood cell and differential cell counts' document. This text emphasizes the importance of white blood cell count and differential cell count in determining the cause of illness, but it does not provide any specific details about the characteristics of these cells.\n\nIn summary, based on the information provided, I can conclude that the patient has an increase in leukocytes without any significant clinical symptoms. However, this conclusion does not directly answer the question about the specific characteristics of these cells.\", \n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
