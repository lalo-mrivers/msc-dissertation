["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about physician compensation schemes. The relevant documents mention different reimbursement methods for physicians, including fee-for-service and capitation. Fee-for-service is mentioned as a method where physicians are paid based on the services they provide, while capitation is not described in detail but seems to be related to payment per patient. This information suggests that fee-for-service may incentivize physicians to increase healthcare utilization, which could lead to overutilization of resources without regard for quality. The documents also mention practice costs and physician work relative value units, which are relevant to the discussion of physician compensation.\n\nConsidering these points, option C seems most plausible: Fee-for-service may incentivize physicians to increase healthcare utilization irrespective of quality.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
