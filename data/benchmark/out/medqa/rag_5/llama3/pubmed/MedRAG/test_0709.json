["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the tubular fluid-to-plasma concentration ratio of urea. The relevant document is 'Renal urate excretion in normal man' which talks about the control of urate excretion and the existence of extensive tubular reabsorption of urate following its glomerular filtration. This suggests that the concentration of urea in the plasma is higher than in the tubular fluid, as the urine is concentrated to eliminate waste products. Therefore, the best description of the tubular fluid-to-plasma concentration ratio of urea would be B.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
