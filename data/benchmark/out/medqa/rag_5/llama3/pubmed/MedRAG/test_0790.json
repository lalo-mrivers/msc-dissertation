["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the correct dosage, we need to calculate the required amount of amoxicillin that needs to be absorbed into the bloodstream. Since oral bioavailability is 75%, this means that 25% of the administered dose will not be absorbed. The target plasma concentration is 2 mg/L, and the minimal inhibitory concentration for the causative pathogen is 1 μg/mL.\n\nThe calculation starts by converting the minimal inhibitory concentration from μg/mL to mg/L: 1 μg/mL × (1000 μg/mg) / (1000 mL/L) = 0.001 mg/mL.\n\nSince we want a plasma concentration of 2 mg/L, this means that the total amount of amoxicillin needed is 2 mg/L - 0.001 mg/mL = 1.999 mg/mL.\n\nThe total daily dose would be the product of the desired plasma concentration and the patient's plasma clearance: 1.999 mg/mL × 15 L/h × (24 h/day) = 5954.8 mg/day.\n\nSince the drug is administered twice a day, the dosing interval is 12 hours. To maintain a steady state, we need to calculate the amount of amoxicillin that needs to be absorbed into the bloodstream during each dosing interval. This can be calculated by dividing the total daily dose by the number of dosing intervals: 5954.8 mg/day ÷ 2 = 2977.4 mg/12 h.\n\nFinally, we need to account for the oral bioavailability (75%) and calculate the administered dose: 2977.4 mg/12 h × (100% / 75%) = 480 mg.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
