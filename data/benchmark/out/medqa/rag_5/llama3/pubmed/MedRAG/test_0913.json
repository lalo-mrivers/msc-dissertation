["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the process that the sequence undergoes in immunocompetent individuals. The sequence was isolated from the patient's serum and identified as being elevated in response to her condition. It binds strongly to a protein on the cell surface of neutrophils and macrophages, suggesting an immune-related process. The fact that it's an amino acid sequence at the carboxy terminus suggests that it might be related to antibody formation. Antibodies are formed through the process of VDJ recombination, where variable (V) and joining (J) gene segments are rearranged to form a unique antibody heavy chain. This is the process typically undergone by this sequence in immunocompetent individuals.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
