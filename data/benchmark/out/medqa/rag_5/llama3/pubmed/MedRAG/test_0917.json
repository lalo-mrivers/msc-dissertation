["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 5-year-old boy with asthma and a history of hospitalizations. His mother has type 2 diabetes mellitus. He presents with sudden loss of consciousness, somnolence, and diaphoresis. Serum studies show hypoglycemia (glucose concentration of 22 mg/dL) and hypokalemia (potassium concentration of 2.4 mEq/L).
