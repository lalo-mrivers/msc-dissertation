["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about reducing the risk of postoperative hyperalgesia in a chronic opioid abuser who has undergone emergency surgery. Given the patient's opioid tolerance, it is likely that a morphine antagonist would be effective in reversing any respiratory depression caused by opioids. Naloxone seems to be the most suitable drug for this purpose, as stated in 'Use of narcotic antagonists in anaesthesia'. Although buprenorphine could have been given intraoperatively as described in 'Buprenorphine as postoperative analgesic', it is not a morphine antagonist. Therefore, an alternative would be to use a drug that has less rapid onset of action and longer duration than naloxone, which is mentioned in the same document. This could have been given intraoperatively to reduce the patient's risk of developing postoperative hyperalgesia.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
