["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has dizziness, bradycardia (68/min), tachypnea (16/min), and hypotension (90/60 mm Hg) after receiving epidural anesthesia. The cervix is fully dilated, and the vertex is at -1 station. Considering the study on delayed recovery after epidural block in labour, it's possible that the patient has prolonged block following epidural anaesthesia. This could lead to hypotension due to sympathetic block. Another possibility is hypovolemia, which was discussed in the paper 'Studies on the haemodynamic action of complamin in pregnancy'. However, since the cervix is fully dilated and the vertex is at -1 station, aortocaval compression is unlikely. Acute pulmonary hypertension seems less likely given that vital signs are within normal limits.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
