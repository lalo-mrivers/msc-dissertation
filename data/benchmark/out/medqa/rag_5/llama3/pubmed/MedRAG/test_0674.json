["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking which drug has a mechanism of action most similar to the new experimental drug that increases incretin levels by preventing their degradation at the endothelium. This process further increases glucose-dependent insulin production. The key point here is that the experimental drug increases incretin levels, not just insulin secretion. Sitagliptin works by increasing incretin levels by inhibiting DPP-4 enzyme, which is responsible for degrading incretins.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
