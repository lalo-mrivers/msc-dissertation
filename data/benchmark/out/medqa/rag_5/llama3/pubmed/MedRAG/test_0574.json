["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks to confirm a diagnosis of loss of polyanions in glomerular basement membranes. According to the provided documents, this is related to glomerular basement membrane thinning in adults and can be seen in cases of IgA nephropathy. Since the patient is an 11-year-old boy, we can focus on pediatric cases. The document 'Hematuria and proteinuria in pediatric patients' discusses diagnostic approaches for renal disease in children. It highlights the importance of considering hematuria and proteinuria as early clues suggesting renal disease. Given that our patient has pitting edema and proteinuria exceeding 3.5g in 24 hours, we can rule out options A (WBC casts in the urine) and D (Bence-Jones proteinuria). Option B (Selective albuminuria) is not relevant to our diagnosis as it does not relate to polyanion loss in glomerular basement membranes. The only remaining option is C (Negatively birefringent crystals in the urine), which could be a manifestation of this condition.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
