["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the given documents, we know that angina pectoris is a condition where there is a mismatch between myocardial oxygen demand and supply. The mechanism of action of beta-blocking drugs in improving exercise tolerance in angina pectoris can be accounted for by the reduction in heart rate and arterial pressure they produce. This information suggests that increased workload on the heart may contribute to anginal symptoms.\n\nThe patient's past medical history is notable for hypercholesterolemia and hypertension, which are risk factors for atherosclerosis. However, his exercise stress test is not provided, but it is mentioned that the person who has asymptomatic myocardial ischemia is at high risk because he does not have the benefit of the warning signals afforded by the substernal pain.\n\nVariant angina with normal coronary arteriogram generally has a benign course and is probably unrelated to atherosclerosis. The patient's symptoms are consistent with variant angina, but this is not confirmed by an exercise stress test or coronary arteriogram.\n\nThe pathophysiology of angina pectoris suggests that myocardial oxygen demand is a function of the product of heart rate and blood pressure. Agents such as nitroglycerin not only produce coronary vasodilatation, which increases oxygen supply, but also reduce myocardial oxygen demand secondary to a reduction in both preload and afterload.\n\nFrom these findings, it appears that increased workload on the heart may contribute to anginal symptoms, possibly due to an increase in left ventricular size with consequent increase in work or an increase in left ventricular diastolic pressure with resultant impairment of blood flow to the inner layers of the myocardium.\n\nThe patient's symptoms are consistent with variant angina, and his past medical history is notable for hypercholesterolemia and hypertension, which are risk factors for atherosclerosis.
