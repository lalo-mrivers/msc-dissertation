["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus and is referred to a urologist due to pain when urinating, difficulty starting a stream of urine, and frequent urination. The digital rectal examination reveals multiple hard nodules in the prostate gland, which are confirmed by biopsy as grade 2 prostate adenocarcinoma. The patient's prostate cancer is well-controlled with goserelin after 9 months.\n\nThe key finding here is that there is a nodule in the right lung that measures 3 cm. This suggests that the patient may have lung cancer.\n\nTo determine which additional findings on CT scans would most likely prompt the removal of such nodules, we need to consider what characteristics are associated with lung cancer.\n\nStudies have shown that pulmonary nodules with a subsolid component or a 'popcorn' pattern are more likely to be malignant and require further evaluation. Doubling time of < 1 month is also an indicator of aggressive growth.\n\nHowever, extending fine striations could suggest benign calcification.\n\nTherefore, considering the patient's history and the findings on CT scan, I would choose option B: Subsolid component.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
