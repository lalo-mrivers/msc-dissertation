["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about why the relationship between cART adherence and DLBCL risk differed between patients with CD4+ cell counts below 200/mm3 and those above. The study suggests that this difference might be due to effect modification, meaning that the association between cART adherence and DLBCL risk varies across levels of CD4+ cell count. This is supported by the fact that the relationship was significant among patients with low CD4+ cell counts (RR = 0.52, p = 0.01) but not among those with high CD4+ cell counts (RR = 0.96, p = 0.36).\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
