["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has a high temperature (104Â°F) and his physical examination shows rigidity of his extremities. This suggests that he may have an underlying condition that is causing his symptoms. Heat stroke would be a possibility, but the patient's blood pressure and pulse are normal, which is unusual for heat stroke. Catatonic schizophrenia could also be considered, but it is typically characterized by a sudden onset of symptoms in response to stress or trauma. The patient's recent history of polysubstance intoxication and his refusal to answer questions suggest that he may have an underlying psychiatric condition.\n\nConsidering the patient's symptoms and medical history, neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) becomes a more likely diagnosis. NMS is a rare but life-threatening condition that can occur in response to certain medications, including antipsychotics like haloperidol. The symptoms of NMS are similar to those seen in the patient, including somnolence, rigidity, and a high temperature.\n\nFinally, oversedation is unlikely given the patient's lack of responsiveness and his rigidity, which suggests that he may be experiencing an underlying condition rather than simply being sedated.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
