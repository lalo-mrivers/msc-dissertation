["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is 42-year-old man with elevated liver function tests. He has a history of severe car accident 30 years ago. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. Laboratory studies show liver enzymes AST and ALT are elevated, alkaline phosphatase is mildly elevated, total bilirubin is normal, albumin is slightly low. Hepatitis B surface antigen is negative, Hepatitis C antibody is positive, HCV RNA is positive, and HCV genotype is 1. The patient has mononuclear infiltrates limited to portal tracts and periportal hepatocyte necrosis on liver biopsy.\n\nConsidering the patient's history of severe car accident 30 years ago and the laboratory findings, it seems likely that the patient has chronic hepatitis C infection. Given the recent advancements in treatment options for HCV, direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) are the most appropriate therapy. Sofosbuvir and ledipasvir combination is a commonly used DAA regimen for genotype 1 HCV.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate next step in management would be A: Sofosbuvir and ledipasvir therapy.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
