["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with shortness of breath and substernal chest pain at rest, which is increased by inspiration. He also has a nonproductive cough, fever, and malaise for 5 days prior to the sudden onset of symptoms. His physical examination shows distended neck veins, bilateral basilar rales, and muffled heart sounds. The ECG shows sinus tachycardia, diffuse ST segment elevation, low voltage QRS complexes, and fluctuating R wave amplitude. Considering these findings, it is likely that the patient has cardiac tamponade or a related condition. Cardiac tamponade is often caused by pericarditis or pericardial effusion. The patient's symptoms, physical examination, and ECG findings are consistent with this diagnosis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
