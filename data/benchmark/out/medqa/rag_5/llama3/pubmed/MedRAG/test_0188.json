["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with a painful left shoulder joint that worsens at night and is accompanied by limited range of motion. The pain is localized to the greater tuberosity of the left shoulder joint along with biceps tendon tenderness over the bicipital groove, suggesting a rotator cuff related issue. The X-ray shows narrowing of the acromiohumeral space with sclerosis and spurring of the acromion, which is consistent with an impingement syndrome.
