["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 15-year-old girl with worsening grades, difficulty finding friends at her new school, and anxiety symptoms. She has avoided saying anything in class since an event where she felt embarrassed. The physical examination shows no abnormalities. The mental status examination reveals the girl avoids eye contact and appears uncomfortable and anxious.\n\nConsidering the relevant documents, we can identify that the patient is experiencing symptoms of anxiety disorder. The case history 'A thrice-told tale of therapy' discusses a patient with manic-depressive illness, but it's not directly applicable to this scenario.\n\nThe article 'Fit-ins' presents patients with intractable dilemmas, which doesn't seem relevant to this case either.\n\nThe document 'Counselling the disturbed family' explains how families may have problems arising from interpersonal relationship difficulties, a 'symptom bearer', or a family crisis. However, it's not directly applicable to this patient's situation.\n\nOn the other hand, 'Clinical exams: interviewing in front of examiners' discusses anxiety-provoking clinical exams, which is somewhat relevant as the patient has mentioned her anxiety symptoms during a presentation. However, it's not specific enough to guide pharmacotherapy.\n\nFinally, 'The difficulties of changing' discusses how our psychological equipment can be unaware of the power of assumptions that condition our perceptions. While this article does provide insight into human behavior, it doesn't specifically address the patient's anxiety disorder or suggest pharmacological interventions.\n\nBased on these considerations, I will focus on the patient's symptoms and look for relevant information from the provided documents.\", \n\"answer_choice\": C"]
