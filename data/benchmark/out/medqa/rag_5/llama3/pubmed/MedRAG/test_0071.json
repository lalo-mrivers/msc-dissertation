["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with a history of motor vehicle collision as an unrestrained driver, with symptoms of chest pain, tachycardia, and elevated pulmonary capillary wedge pressure and troponins. The ECG is notable only for sinus tachycardia, which suggests that cardiac damage may be the primary concern. The patient's physical exam reveals bruising over his chest wall, which is consistent with blunt trauma to the thoracic cavity.
