["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 13-year-old boy with progressive left leg pain for 2 months. He was previously hit by a baseball which caused swelling and redness of the thigh. The x-ray shows multiple lytic lesions in the middle third of the femur, and the surrounding cortex is covered by several layers of new bone. A biopsy shows small round blue cells.

However, this is unlikely given the age of the patient and the radiographic findings.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
