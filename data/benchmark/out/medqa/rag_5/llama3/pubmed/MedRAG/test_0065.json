["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has a history of non-small cell lung cancer that was successfully treated 1 year ago. The pain is described as a dull, constant ache that is worse at night and is located along the lumbosacral area. There is no evidence of trauma or precipitating event except for the amateur weight-lifting competition 2 months ago.

Therefore, I would look for imaging findings that are consistent with metastatic disease to the spine.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
