["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is presenting with chest pain and nausea, which are concerning symptoms. Given his history of hypertension and smoking, it's possible that he may be experiencing an acute coronary syndrome. Additionally, the cocaine abuse in the past 2 weeks could also be contributing to his condition. The first step in management would be to stabilize the patient and rule out any life-threatening conditions.\n\nThe patient is diaphoretic and in marked distress, which suggests a severe presentation. Reassurance alone may not be sufficient given the severity of the symptoms.\n\nAmong the options provided, none of them directly address the acute coronary syndrome or cocaine withdrawal. However, labetalol (option B) can be used to treat hypertension and possibly help with the chest pain. It's also a beta blocker that could help slow down the patient's heart rate and blood pressure, which may be beneficial in this situation.\n\nDiltiazem (option A) is typically used to treat angina or hypertension, but it's not as directly relevant to the patient's current condition.\n\nPropranolol (option C) is also a beta blocker that could help with the patient's symptoms, but it's not specifically indicated for the management of this patient's condition.\n\nTherefore, the first step in management would be to stabilize the patient and address his hypertension using labetalol (option B).\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
