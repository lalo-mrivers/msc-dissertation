["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's newborn has a combination of features that suggest a possible link to lithium exposure during the first trimester. The mother was treated with lithium until 5 weeks' gestation. The patient's examination shows micrognathia, broad nasal bridge, short philtrum, small and low-set ears, cleft palate, and an overriding great vessel arising from the heart (Ebstein's anomaly).
