["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 3-year-old boy with symptoms of fatigue, shortness of breath, and a localized harsh pansystolic murmur heard over the left sternal border. The murmur becomes louder when he squats, suggesting an obstruction to ventricular outflow. This symptom profile is consistent with asymmetric septal hypertrophy (ASH), which is known to cause obstruction to ventricular outflow in children. ASH is a condition where one part of the heart muscle grows thicker than the rest of the heart muscle. In this case, we are looking for the structure that gives rise to the defective structure causing the patient's symptoms. According to the provided documents, including 'Asymetric septal hypertrophy in childhood', ASH can cause obstruction to ventricular outflow. Therefore, it is likely that the defective structure giving rise to the patient's symptoms is related to the infundibular septum.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
