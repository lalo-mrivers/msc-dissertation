["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 28-year-old female with a new onset diastolic murmur found on physical examination. She has no significant past medical history. Her vital signs are normal. The echocardiogram reveals a large pedunculated tumor in the left atrium. This suggests that the murmur may be related to the presence of a cardiac mass, rather than any underlying heart disease. Given this information, it is unlikely that she would be at risk for sudden cardiac death or acute arterial occlusion. Septic embolism is also unlikely given her normal vital signs and lack of symptoms such as fever or chills. Therefore, I think the most likely answer is A: Abrupt hypotension.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
