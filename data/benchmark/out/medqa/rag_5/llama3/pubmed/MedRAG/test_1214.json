["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has decreasing urinary output, increasing serum creatinine concentrations (2.1 mg/dL on the second postoperative day and 4.1 mg/dL currently), and tubulitis on biopsy. This suggests an episode of rejection, likely occurring after immediate primary function. The patient's history of adult polycystic kidney disease and maintenance hemodialysis prior to transplantation also supports this conclusion.\n\nThe patient is not showing signs of fibrosis of the glomerular vessels, as there is no mention of a specific examination or imaging findings that would indicate this. Newly formed anti-HLA antibodies are unlikely given the negative C4d staining result.\n\nDrug-induced nephrotoxicity may be possible but it seems less likely than an episode of rejection given the patient's history and laboratory results. Recipient T-cells in the graft is the most plausible explanation for the patient's findings, as it is consistent with the clinical scenario and laboratory results.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
