["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the patient's symptoms, we can deduce that she is experiencing a severe headache, which is likely to be related to her history of depression. The fact that she stopped taking sertraline 2 months ago suggests that her depression has improved, but she may still have underlying anxiety or emotional factors contributing to her current headache. The patient's history of headaches and her recent use of ibuprofen suggest that this is likely a tension-type headache rather than a migraine. Given the severity of her symptoms, we need to consider treatment options that can help alleviate her pain and discomfort.\n\nFrom the provided documents, we know that combination agents are useful for treating head pain of low intensity, but in this case, the patient's symptoms suggest a more severe condition. We also know that aspirin remains the most practical and useful analgesic for head pain of low intensity, but again, this patient's symptoms suggest a more severe headache.\n\nConsidering the patient's history of depression and her current symptoms, we can infer that she may have some underlying anxiety or emotional factors contributing to her headache. Therefore, a treatment option that addresses these underlying factors could be beneficial.\n\nAfter considering all these factors, I believe that Propranolol would be the best treatment option for this patient's acute symptoms.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
