["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has a 1-day history of sudden severe pain in his right great toe. He has a history of hypertension treated with hydrochlorothiazide and nephrolithiasis. His serum uric acid is 12 mg/dL, which suggests that the mechanism underlying this episode is likely related to overproduction or underexcretion of uric acid, rather than impaired renal function. The arthrocentesis yields cloudy fluid with a leukocyte count of 18,500/mm3 (80% segmented neutrophils), which is consistent with acute gouty arthritis. Polarized light microscopy of the synovial fluid shows characteristic needle-shaped monosodium urate crystals. Given that the patient has had previous episodes of joint pain and has hyperuricemia, antihyperuricemic therapy may be indicated in addition to treatment aimed at controlling the acute attack.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"]
