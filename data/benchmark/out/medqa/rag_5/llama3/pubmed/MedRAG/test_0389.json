["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has a wound in the back and complains of weakness in the left leg. The physical examination shows 2/5 strength in the left lower extremity, loss of vibration sense and light touch on the left lower extremity, and loss of pain and temperature sensation in the right lower extremity. This suggests that there is damage to the nerve or spinal cord. Since the patient has numbness and tingling on both sides (right and left), it's likely related to a lesion above the level of the spinal cord. The patient also has weakness in one side, which suggests a hemisection of the cord rather than a complete transaction.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
