["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 13-year-old boy with pain in his right knee exacerbated by jogging and climbing up stairs. There is no history of trauma to the knee. The examination shows tender swelling at the proximal tibia, full range of motion, and pain on knee extension against resistance.
