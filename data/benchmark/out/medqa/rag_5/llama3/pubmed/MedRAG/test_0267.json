["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the probability that the second daughter is a carrier of hemophilia A. Since the first two daughters are unaffected, the mother must be a heterozygote (carrying one normal and one affected allele). The study on 'The phenotypic range of hemophilia A carriers' shows that there are three possible phenotypes for heterozygous females: clinically affected, clinically normal but phenotypically abnormal, and clinically and phenotypically normal. Since the wife of the 34-year-old male is not mentioned to have any symptoms or abnormalities, we can infer that she is a carrier who is clinically and phenotypically normal.\n\nIn this case, we can apply Bayes' theorem: P(C|D) = P(D|C)*P(C)/P(D), where C is the event that the mother is a carrier, D is the event that the second daughter is a carrier, P(C) is the prior probability of the mother being a carrier (which is unknown but assumed to be around 50%), and P(D|C) is the likelihood of the second daughter being a carrier given that the mother is a carrier.\n\nThe study on 'Homozygous expression of haemophilia B in a heterozygote' shows that even though the mother may be clinically and phenotypically normal, her son can still express the affected allele. Therefore, P(D|C) = 1, as there is a high chance of the second daughter being a carrier.\n\nFinally, we get: P(C|D) = 1*P(C)/P(D) = 1/P(D). Since P(D) = P(C)*P(D|C) + P(~C)*P(D|~C) (where ~C is the event that the mother is not a carrier), and since there are no other factors influencing P(D), we can assume that P(D) = 0.5*1 + 0.5*0 = 0.5.\n\nTherefore, P(C|D) = 1/0.5 = 2. So, the probability that the second daughter is a carrier given that the mother is a carrier is 100%.\n\nThe answer is D: 100%.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
