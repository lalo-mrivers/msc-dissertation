["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 10-year-old boy with a painless mass in the left testicle. The biopsy shows glomeruli-like structures with a central capillary within a mesodermal core, lined by flattened layers of germ cells. The AFP level is elevated at 350 ng/mL, which suggests a possible yolk sac tumor. However, the hCG level is low at 0.4 IU/L, which is not consistent with a pure yolk sac tumor. Given this information and the patient's age, I believe the most likely diagnosis is a mixed germ cell tumor that includes an element of yolk sac tumor.\", \"answer_choice\": D}"]
