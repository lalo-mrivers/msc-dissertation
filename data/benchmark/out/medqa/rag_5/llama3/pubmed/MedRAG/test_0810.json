["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has a routine full blood count prior to elective cholecystectomy. The lab test results show that the hemoglobin is 12.1 g/dL, MCV is 85 Î¼m3, MCHC is 47%, reticulocyte count is 3.4 %, white blood cell count is 9700/mm3, and platelet count is 229,000/mm3. A peripheral blood smear reveals spherocytes, and the Coombs test is negative. The physical examination is remarkable for scleral icterus and moderate splenomegaly.
