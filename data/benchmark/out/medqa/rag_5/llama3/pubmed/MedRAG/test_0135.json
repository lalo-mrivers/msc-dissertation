["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The passage describes interactions between MHC class I molecules and CD8. It also talks about HIV infection and the interaction between gp120 and CD4. The researcher is studying a cell population that is positive for CD8, so it's likely that they are looking at CD8+ T cells. Since the protein bound to CD8 has two chains from an adjacent cell, it might be related to MHC class I molecules. Considering this information, the primary function of the protein most likely identified would be to bind peptides or antigens presented by MHC class I molecules.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
