["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 21-year-old woman with sudden onset of high blood pressure. She has no family history of hypertension or metabolic syndromes. On examination, her diastolic blood pressure is elevated (92 mm Hg). Given the normal physical examination and lack of other cardiovascular risk factors, we can consider two possible conditions: labile blood pressure or consistent mild elevation in diastolic blood pressure.
