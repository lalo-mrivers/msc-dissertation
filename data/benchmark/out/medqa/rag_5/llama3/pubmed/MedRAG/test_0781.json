["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to the question, HIF-1a is targeted for proteasomal degradation by VHL protein under normoxia. However, RCC can inhibit HIF-1a hydroxylation even in normoxic conditions, leading to increased activity of HIF-1a. Since the researcher wants to detect HIF-1a in RCC under normoxic conditions, we would expect the Western blot to show increased HIF-1a compared to a normoxic control cell.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
