["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has a disease that requires recurrent upper respiratory infections, antibiotic prophylaxis, chest physiotherapy, and pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy. This suggests that the patient likely has cystic fibrosis. Cystic fibrosis is an autosomal recessive disorder, meaning that a person must inherit two copies of the mutated gene (one from each parent) to express the disease. The patient's husband does not have the disease phenotype, but he could be a carrier if the prevalence in his population is 1/100. The chance of their child having the disease would depend on the genotype of the parents. If both parents are carriers, there would be a 1/4 chance that the child would inherit two copies of the mutated gene and express the disease.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
