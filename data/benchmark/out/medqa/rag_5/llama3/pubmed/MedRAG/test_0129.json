["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with sudden onset of blurry vision, double vision, and a history of nausea, vomiting, and watery diarrhea after eating at a picnic. The patient's friend who attended the same picnic also developed similar symptoms. The patient has fixed pupillary dilation and difficulty depressing both eyes. Based on these findings, I think the patient may have a neurological or ophthalmological condition rather than a gastrointestinal one. Given the sudden onset of visual changes and the presence of double vision, I consider posterior segment (vitreoretinal) and retrobulbar (optic nerve) conditions as possible causes. The patient's symptoms are consistent with posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES), which can cause blurred vision, diplopia, and other neurological symptoms.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
