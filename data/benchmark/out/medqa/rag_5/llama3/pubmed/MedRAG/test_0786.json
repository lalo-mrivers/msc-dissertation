["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's coagulation tests show a prolonged partial thromboplastin time (53 seconds) and bleeding time (3 minutes), but the prothrombin time is within normal range. This suggests a defect in intrinsic pathway of coagulation, which is measured by the partial thromboplastin time. Additionally, the patient has a history of abnormal coagulation lab tests before an appendectomy. Considering this information, we can conclude that the patient likely has a deficiency in one of the factors involved in the intrinsic pathway.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B: Factor VIII\""]
