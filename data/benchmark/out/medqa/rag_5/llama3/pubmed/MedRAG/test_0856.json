["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Given the patient's HIV viral load of 15,000 copies/mL and CD4+ count of 170 cells/mm^3, it is likely that he has early-stage HIV infection. According to the documents, zidovudine is approved for treatment of early HIV infection and recommended for all HIV-positive adults with or without symptoms who have absolute CD4 helper cell counts less than 500.
