["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The first patient can lift his head and chest when in the prone position, which suggests that he is around 1-2 months old. He also voids at least eight times per day, which is consistent with this age range. Additionally, his stools are yellow, and he doesn't seem to be straining, indicating normal digestion.\n\nThe second patient can roll from supine to prone and transfer her rattle from hand to hand, which suggests that she is around 4-6 months old. She also cannot yet say any words, which is consistent with this age range.\n\nThe third patient has started taking independent steps at home and recognizes the names of several objects, which suggests that he is around 9-12 months old. He also can't follow the direction to 'grab the ball', indicating that his language skills are still developing.\n\nBased on these observations, we can infer that the patients' respective ages are: 1-2 months (first patient), 4-6 months (second patient), and 9-12 months (third patient).\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
