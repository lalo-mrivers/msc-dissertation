["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the relationship between lung volume and transpulmonary pressure. The graph shows static pressure-volume curves. Since the graph corresponds to a healthy 21-year-old man, it is likely that the upper lobe curve is represented. In 'Reference values of respiratory parameters in adults 4th paper: reference values for screening parameters of lung mechanics (author's transl)', we can find that total lung capacity (D) is the maximum volume that can be exhaled from the lungs after a full inspiration.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
