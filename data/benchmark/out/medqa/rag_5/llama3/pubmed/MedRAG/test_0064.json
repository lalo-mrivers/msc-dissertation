The patient's sexual activity and use of barrier protection also support this diagnosis.\\r\\nThe medication should have a mechanism that targets the fungal pathogen. Among the options, C: Inhibition of 14-alpha-demethylase is not relevant to fungal infections.\\r\\nD: Inhibition of beta-glucan synthase is an antifungal mechanism. B: Disruption of microtubule formation does not relate to fungal infections. A: Disruption of cell membrane permeability can be related to various conditions, but is not a specific antifungal mechanism.\\r\\nTherefore, the most appropriate medication for this patient would have an antifungal mechanism.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
