["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the patient's symptoms of painful enlarging bruises and skin ulceration over his thighs and external genitalia, three days after being started on warfarin therapy, it is likely that the patient has developed skin necrosis following warfarin therapy. The relevant documents describe this as a rare but potentially lethal complication of coumarin and its congeners, which includes warfarin. The symptoms described in the patient's case are consistent with those reported in the literature, including pedal manifestations. Therefore, it is likely that the patient will benefit from treatment with an anticoagulant that does not cause necrosis. Heparin is suggested as a treatment option in one of the documents, and since heparin never causes necrosis, it may well prevent further necrosis due to the thrombotic process.\", \"answer_choice\": C}"]
