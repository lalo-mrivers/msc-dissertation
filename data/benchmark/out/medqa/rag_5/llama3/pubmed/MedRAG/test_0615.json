["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is experiencing neck stiffness and pain with rotation to the right. The episodes are short-lived (25 minutes) but frequent. The patient has received haloperidol for auditory hallucinations and appears anxious. Considering the symptoms, I think of potential causes such as tetanus, given the history of substance-induced psychosis and the rigidity of the neck. Tetanus is a rare disease in the UK, but it should be considered in patients presenting with progressive dysphagia or neck stiffness. The patient's symptoms match the case reports discussed in the document 'Dysphagia as a major symptom of tetanus'. Therefore, I believe that the most appropriate therapy for this patient's symptoms is Dantrolene, which is used to treat tetanus.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
