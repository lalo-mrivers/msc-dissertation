["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has a history of hypertension and peripheral vascular disease. He is presenting with jugular venous distension and bilateral lower extremity pitting edema, which may be indicative of heart failure. His blood pressure is elevated (167/118 mmHg). The patient has not been filling his prescriptions or attending follow-up appointments as scheduled.\n\nConsidering the patient's history and physical exam findings, it appears that he may have hypertension with cardiac involvement. Mild hypertension: to treat or not to treat? suggests that treating mild hypertension can be challenging, but in this case, the patient's blood pressure is quite high (167/118 mmHg).\n\nPulmonary embolism does not seem relevant to this patient's condition.\n\nElectrocardiography in routine health screening does not provide direct information about the patient's condition.\n\nPrimary pulmonary hypertension is a rare and fatal disease that does not appear relevant to this patient's case.\n\nThe value of electrocardiography in routine health screening suggests that abnormal electrocardiographic findings can be present in 9.5% of clinically well subjects, but it does not provide direct information about the patient's condition.\n\nBased on the patient's history and physical exam findings, the greatest mortality benefit will likely come from treating his hypertension.\n\nMild hypertension: to treat or not to treat? suggests that there is no conclusive evidence for the treatment of mild hypertensives, but in this case, the patient's blood pressure is quite high (167/118 mmHg).\n\nThe major risk factor associated with cardiovascular disease has been found to be elevated blood pressure.\n\nPulmonary embolism does not seem relevant to this patient's condition.\n\nThe patient's past medical history of hypertension and peripheral vascular disease may indicate that he is more likely to benefit from treatment for his hypertension.\n\nBased on the information presented, the greatest mortality benefit in this patient will likely come from treating his hypertension. This can be done with a beta blocker such as atenolol or metoprolol succinate.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
