["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the mechanism of action of omeprazole. Since it's used to treat duodenal ulcer secondary to H. pylori infection, it likely plays a role in reducing acid secretion. The relevant documents mention nothing about parasympathetic inhibition or reversible block of H2 receptors. Vitamin E and tricyclic antidepressants are mentioned for their effects on different diseases. Tetracycline is discussed as causing aplastic anemia. Spironolactone's effect on electrolyte balance is also mentioned. However, none of these documents provide information about the mechanism of action of omeprazole.\n\nThe patient was prescribed triple therapy of omeprazole, clarithromycin, and amoxicillin for duodenal ulcer secondary to H. pylori infection. This suggests that omeprazole's mechanism of action is related to acid secretion reduction.\n\nThe last option D: Inhibition of 50S ribosomal subunit seems less plausible given the context and the fact that it's not a well-known mechanism of action for any commonly used medication.\n\nTherefore, the best description of omeprazole's mechanism of action is likely C: Inhibition of primary active transport.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
