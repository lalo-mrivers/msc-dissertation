["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 15-year-old female with severe menstrual cramping. She has irregular cycles, but recently they have become regular every 28-35 days. The cramps are intermittent and dull ache-like in the center of her abdomen, accompanied by back pain. She uses heating pads with limited relief. As there is no abdominal tenderness, this suggests that the issue may not be related to a pelvic organ or structure. The patient's family history includes hypertension and endometriosis. Given these factors, it seems unlikely that the issue is related to nemaline myopathy or parkinsonism. There is also no evidence of neuralgiform paroxysmal migraine-like symptoms. Considering the patient's age, symptoms, and lack of any significant findings on physical examination, the most likely cause of her menstrual cramps is endometriosis.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C: NSAIDs\""]
