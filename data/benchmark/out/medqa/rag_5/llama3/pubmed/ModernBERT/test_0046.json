["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To calculate the number needed to treat (NNT) for the primary endpoint of death from cardiac causes, we need to find the odds ratio and then use it to calculate the NNT. The p-value for the primary endpoint is 0.03, which suggests that there is a statistically significant difference between medication 1 and medication 2 in terms of death from cardiac causes. We can see that the number of patients who died from cardiac causes with medication 1 (134) is lower than with medication 2 (210). This suggests that medication 1 may be beneficial in reducing mortality from cardiac causes. To calculate the odds ratio, we need to divide the rate of death from cardiac causes for medication 1 by the rate of death from cardiac causes for medication 2. The odds ratio is then used to calculate the NNT using the formula: NNT = 1 / (odds ratio - 1).\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
