["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's anemia is characterized by a normocytic-normochromic morphology with a mean corpuscular volume of 76 fL. The hemoglobin level is decreased at 9.2 g/dL, and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate is elevated at 85 mm/h. There is no mention of microcytic or macrocytic features in the laboratory results. The patient has a history of rheumatoid arthritis, which can be associated with anemia.

Considering these findings, the most likely cause of the anemia is an underlying chronic inflammatory condition.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
