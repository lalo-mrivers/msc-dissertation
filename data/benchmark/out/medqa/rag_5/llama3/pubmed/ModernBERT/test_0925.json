["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with recurrent bacterial infections since birth. The physical examination reveals light-colored skin with silver-colored hair. The study of the boy's neutrophils shows large cytoplasmic vacuoles. Genetic studies show a mutation in the LYST gene. Considering these findings, we can rule out acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) as it is not typically seen in children and does not have characteristic physical features such as light-colored skin with silver-colored hair. Common variable immunodeficiency may be considered but the presence of large cytoplasmic vacuoles in neutrophils points towards a different diagnosis. Leukocyte adhesion deficiencyâ€“1 can also be ruled out as it is typically characterized by impaired phagocytosis and not by large cytoplasmic vacuoles. Chediak-Higashi syndrome, which is characterized by the presence of large cytoplasmic vacuoles in neutrophils and other immune cells, seems to be a good fit considering the patient's physical features and laboratory findings.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
