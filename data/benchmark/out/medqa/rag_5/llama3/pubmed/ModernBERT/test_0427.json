["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the effects of miglitol on specific chemical bonds. Miglitol is an alpha-glucosidase inhibitor, which means it inhibits the breakdown of complex carbohydrates into simpler sugars. Specifically, it inhibits the enzyme that breaks down disaccharides like maltose and sucrose. This suggests that glycosidic bonds are the ones that will no longer be cleaved when the patient takes miglitol.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
