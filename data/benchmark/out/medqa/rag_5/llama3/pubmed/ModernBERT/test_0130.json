["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 4-week-old female newborn with increasing yellowing of her eyes and skin for 2 weeks. The mother has switched the baby to formula feeds after reading that breastfeeding could be the cause of her symptoms. The patient's liver is palpated 2 cm below the right costal margin, suggesting possible liver dysfunction. The laboratory results show elevated bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, and γ-glutamyl transferase levels, which are consistent with biliary obstruction or cholestasis. Given that breastfeeding was recently discontinued, it's unlikely to be the primary cause of the symptoms. Considering the patient's age and presentation, I'm ruling out Crigler–Najjar syndrome and Galactosemia as they typically present earlier in infancy. Breast milk jaundice is less likely given the recent formula feeding change.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
