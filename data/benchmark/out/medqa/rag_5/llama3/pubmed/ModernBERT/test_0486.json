["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 2-year-old boy presenting with respiratory distress after waking up from sleep. The parents report a 'hacking' cough followed by high-pitched breathing sounds. No access to small objects or toys in the bed. Physical exam shows respiratory distress.\n\nConsidering the patient's age and history of runny nose, epiglottitis is a possible diagnosis. However, there is no mention of stridor or severe drooling which are common symptoms of epiglottitis.\n\nThe presence of 'hacking' cough and high-pitched breathing sounds may indicate an upper airway obstruction. The patient's sudden onset of respiratory distress after waking up from sleep suggests that the obstruction may have occurred during sleep, possibly due to a foreign body aspiration.\n\nGiven these findings, bronchoscopy to remove a foreign body in the upper airway is a reasonable approach.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
