["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the changes seen at point D in the graph. The relevant documents discuss gastric emptying and stomach acid secretion. The mention of pH of stomach contents suggests that the meal consumed was likely high in carbohydrates and proteins, which would slow down gastric emptying. This slowing would be regulated by receptors responding to the osmotically active products of digestion, rather than direct measurement of energy density. Therefore, the mechanism most likely contributing to the changes seen at point D is the regulation of gastric emptying by the duodenal system.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
