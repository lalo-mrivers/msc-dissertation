["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the statistical power of the new screening test, we need to analyze its sensitivity (45/50 = 0.9) and specificity (15/55 = 0.27). The false negative rate is (5/95 = 0.053), and the false positive rate is (15/45 = 0.333). Since the study is designed as a comparison of the new screening test against the gold standard, it's not a straightforward calculation to determine the power. However, we can infer that increasing specificity would increase the number of true negatives (disease absent) and potentially decrease the statistical power, whereas decreasing sensitivity would increase the number of false negatives (disease present) and also decrease the statistical power.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
