["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has symptoms of increased muscle tone and hyperthermia. The laboratory studies are not mentioned as abnormal. The patient's temperature is high, but not extremely so. Muscle rigidity is often seen in neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) or serotonin syndrome. Both conditions are caused by the use of certain medications such as antiemetics and anesthetics.\n\nThe patient's symptoms persisted despite initial treatment with IV fluids, lorazepam, and a cooling blanket.
