["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient had a fever and chills two hours after an elective cholecystectomy. The symptoms are not related to the surgical site as there is no erythema or swelling. The patient's medical history includes hypertension treated with lisinopril, which suggests that the patient has a controlled blood pressure. The patient received cephalexin for antibiotic prophylaxis and one unit of packed red blood cells during the procedure, which rules out an adverse effect of medication and a transfusion reaction.
