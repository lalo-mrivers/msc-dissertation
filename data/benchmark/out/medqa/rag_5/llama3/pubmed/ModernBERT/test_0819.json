["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 17-year-old girl who has not attained menarche. She has normal breast development but no uterus or ovaries on ultrasonography. There is also a firm, nontender left inguinal mass present. Considering the symptoms and physical examination findings, the possible causes of this patient's symptoms are related to sex development disorders. The presence of a mass in the inguinal region suggests that it might be a teratoma or an ectopic testis. However, since there is no uterus or ovaries on ultrasonography, it is unlikely that she has Turner syndrome (sex chromosome monosomy). 5-Î± reductase deficiency and androgen insensitivity can cause abnormalities in sex development but are not directly related to the presence of a mass in the inguinal region. Therefore, the most likely underlying cause is an ectopic testis or teratoma.\", \"answer_choice\": B}"]
