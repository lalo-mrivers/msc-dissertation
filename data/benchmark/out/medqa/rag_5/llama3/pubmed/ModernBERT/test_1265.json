["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. She stopped attending wine club meetings and her house appears more disorganized over the past two weeks. She also reports feeling like her balance is getting worse. The patient's BMI is 31 kg/m^2 which indicates obesity. On examination, she is oriented to person and time but not place or situation. She has a low-frequency tremor in her right arm that increases in severity with deliberate movement. These symptoms are more indicative of abulia than Alzheimer dementia, Lewy body dementia, or normal pressure hydrocephalus. Abulia is characterized by a lack of initiative, interest, or motivation, and the patient's history of ceasing to attend wine club meetings and becoming disorganized may suggest this diagnosis.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
