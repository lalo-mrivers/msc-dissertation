["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with acute-onset shortness of breath while repairing a plowing tractor. He denies having any history of asthma or respiratory symptoms, and does not smoke. His oxygen saturation is 97%. On exam, he is pale and diaphoretic. His pupils are contracted.
