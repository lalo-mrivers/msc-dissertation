["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about promoting healing in cartilaginous injuries. The key point to note is that the injuries show minimal signs of healing after 8 weeks. This suggests that there may be a lack of progenitor cells for matrix regeneration, which is supported by the fact that bone fractures, which have osteoblasts as progenitor cells, show almost complete resolution.\n\nThe options provided are all related to different types of tissues or molecules involved in cartilage and bone healing. Perichondrium is a layer of connective tissue surrounding cartilage, proteoglycans are important components of cartilage matrix, osteoblasts are responsible for bone formation, and mature chondrocytes are the cell type that produces and maintains cartilage.\n\nConsidering these points, it's clear that promoting healing in cartilaginous injuries requires introducing progenitor cells that can regenerate the damaged tissue. Among the options provided, only C: Osteoblasts would provide such a source of progenitor cells.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"]
