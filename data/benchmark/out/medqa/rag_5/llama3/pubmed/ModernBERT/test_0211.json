He has a history of HIV diagnosis 10 years ago and admits to not always being compliant with his antiretroviral medication. The physical examination reveals multiple non-tender swollen lymph nodes bilaterally in the anterior and posterior triangles of the neck, axillary and inguinal lymphadenopathy on the right side, and an enlarged spleen.\n\nThe laboratory studies show a hemoglobin level of 9 g/dL, mean corpuscular volume of 88 Î¼m3, leukocyte count of 18,000/mm3, platelet count of 130,000/mm3, serum creatinine of 1.1 mg/dL, and serum lactate dehydrogenase of 1,000 U/L.\n\nConsidering the patient's history of HIV and the laboratory results, it is likely that the patient has a lymphoma related to his immunodeficiency state. Therefore, the next best diagnostic step would be to perform an excisional biopsy of a superficial axillary lymph node on the right side, which confirms the diagnosis.\n\nThe options A, B, C, and D are not relevant in this case.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: Tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) test\"\n}"]
