["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 7-day-old newborn boy presenting with fever, irritability, and generalized erythema. The parents tried to control the symptoms using acetaminophen but the newborn continued to be ill and blisters appeared around the buttocks, hands, and feet. During physical examination, vital signs show body temperature 39.0°C (102.3°F), heart rate 130/min, and respiratory rate 45/min. Ears, nose, and oral mucosa are preserved while skin shows diffuse blanching erythema and flaccid blisters with a positive Nikolsky’s sign. Given the patient's age, clinical presentation, and physical examination findings, I suspect an autoimmune disorder or an infection that causes blistering of the skin.\n\nThe most likely diagnosis is scalded skin syndrome (SSS) due to its characteristic symptoms, such as fever, erythema, blisters, and Nikolsky’s sign. SSS is a rare but serious condition in newborns caused by staphylococcal toxin or other bacterial toxins that can lead to widespread blistering of the skin. The patient's young age and clinical presentation are consistent with this diagnosis.\n\nThe other options do not fit the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings as well as SSS does.\", \"answer_choice\": B}"]
