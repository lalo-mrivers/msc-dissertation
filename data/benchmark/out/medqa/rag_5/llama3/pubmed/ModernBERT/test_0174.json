["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The study compares the survival time of patients diagnosed with GBM through screening MRI versus those who developed symptoms first. The average survival time for asymptomatic patients is 6 weeks longer than that of symptomatic patients. This suggests that earlier detection through screening MRI may be associated with improved survival. Considering the endpoints, length-time bias could have occurred as a result of the endpoint selected.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
