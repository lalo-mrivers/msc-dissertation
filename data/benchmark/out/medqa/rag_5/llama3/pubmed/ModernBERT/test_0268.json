He also experiences constant ear ringing and episodes of unsteadiness. The physical examination reveals normal outer ears and otoscopic findings are unremarkable.

This suggests a sensorineural hearing loss rather than an conductive one, which would be more consistent with damage to the cochlea or inner ear.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
