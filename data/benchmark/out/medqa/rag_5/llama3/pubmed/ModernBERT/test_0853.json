["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has a history of polysubstance intoxication and has been given diphenhydramine and haloperidol. He is somnolent and non-responsive with a high body temperature (104Â°F) and blood pressure. His rigidity makes it difficult to manipulate his extremities freely. He also has dry mucous membranes. The combination of these findings suggests that the patient may be experiencing an adverse reaction to one or more of the medications he has been given, particularly haloperidol. Heat stroke is a possibility due to the patient's exposure to high temperatures and hyperthermia. However, the presence of rigidity and dry mucous membranes suggests a more severe condition, such as neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS). Catatonic schizophrenia is unlikely given the patient's recent polysubstance intoxication and the fact that he does not respond to commands. Finally, oversedation is also an unlikely diagnosis due to the patient's lack of responsiveness and rigidity. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is NMS.\", \"answer_choice\": C}"]
