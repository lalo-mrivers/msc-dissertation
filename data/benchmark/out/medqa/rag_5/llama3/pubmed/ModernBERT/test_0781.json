["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The researcher wants to detect HIF-1a in RCC under normoxic conditions. This means that the cells are being grown in a normal oxygen environment, not hypoxia. Since VHL protein hydroxylates prolyl residues on oxygen-dependent degradation domains of HIF-1a, targeting it for proteasomal degradation, and this process is inhibited under hypoxic conditions, we can conclude that under normoxic conditions, HIF-1a will be targeted for degradation. Therefore, a Northern blot (which detects RNA levels) or a Southern blot (which detects specific DNA sequences) will not show increased HIF-1α.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: A Western blot will show decreased HIF-1α compared to a normoxic control.\""]
