["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is described as having personality changes, including increased irritability, loudness, aggression, and impulsivity. He also has jerky movements of his limbs and trunk. The patient's father had dementia in his mid-40s. On examination, the patient has irregular movements of his extremities and twitching of his face and tongue. Mental status examination shows impaired memory.\n\nBased on these symptoms, I think that the patient may have Meige's Disease, which is characterized by facial twitching, hand fidgeting, vocal tremor, loss of self-esteem, and depression.\n\nI also consider Cogan syndrome, which can cause motor symptoms and hearing loss. However, the patient does not report any hearing loss or vestibular symptoms.\n\nProgressive supranuclear palsy may be a possibility as well, but it typically affects older adults and is characterized by falls, difficulty walking, nuchal rigidity, abnormalities of gaze, pseudobulbar features, and mild dementia.\n\nThe case of Ekbom syndrome does not seem relevant to this patient's symptoms.\n\nFinally, I consider the possibility that the patient may have a neurological disorder caused by head injury, such as those reported in the autopsy case. However, there is no history of head trauma in this patient.\n\nBased on these considerations, I think that Meige's Disease is the most likely diagnosis for this patient.\n\nSince the question asks about changes on MRI, I look at the relevant documents and find that Meige's disease can be associated with reduced hippocampal volume. Therefore, I choose answer A: Reduced hippocampal volume.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
