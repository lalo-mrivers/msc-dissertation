["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient was born with a disease that requires recurrent upper respiratory infections treatment. The husband's population has a prevalence of 1/100, which means the father is likely to be a carrier of the disease but does not express it himself. Since the mother expresses the disease, we can assume it's an autosomal recessive disorder. This type of inheritance pattern means that both parents must contribute recessive alleles for the child to inherit the condition. The risk of passing on the disease from the father is 1/100 (because he's a carrier), and since the mother has the disease herself, there is no chance of her not passing it on (since she expresses the disease). Therefore, we multiply the probability of the father passing on the disease by the probability of the mother passing on the disease. 1/100 x 1 = 1/100.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
