["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the pattern of glutamate release from presynaptic nerve terminals. The relevant information comes from the document 'Effects of ethanol on the excitability of hippocampal granule neurons'. According to this document, the effects of low dose ethanol treatment on neuronal firing threshold were studied in dentate granule neurons using intracellular recording. Experiments involving blockade of glutamate-receptor subtypes suggest that an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor mediated mechanism is implicated in this action of ethanol. This implies that the release of neurotransmitters, specifically glutamate, is associated with the opening of NMDA receptors.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
