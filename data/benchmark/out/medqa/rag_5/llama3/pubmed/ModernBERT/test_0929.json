["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about a drug that reduces the action of testosterone by blocking the androgen receptor. The patient has been treated for prostate cancer with an experimental drug (drug X) that slows down the growth of cancerous tissue. The patient has no significant complaints except for excessive sweating at times, and on physical examination, a small area of tissue around his nipples is enlarged bilaterally. Based on this information, I am looking for a drug that belongs to the same class as drug X. Leuprolide is an LHRH analog that reduces testosterone production by suppressing pituitary gonadotropin release. Finasteride is a 5-alpha-reductase inhibitor that prevents conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (DHT). Flutamide is a pure antiandrogen that binds to androgen receptors, preventing them from accepting androgens. Anastrozole is an aromatase inhibitor that reduces estrogen production by blocking the conversion of androgens to estrogens. Given the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, I believe that drug X is likely finasteride.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
