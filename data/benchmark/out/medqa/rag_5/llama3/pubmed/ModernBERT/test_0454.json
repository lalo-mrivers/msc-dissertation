["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is presenting with severe headache, palpitations, and profuse sweating. He has episodic headaches and palpitations that started 3 months ago. The physical exam reveals pallor and perspiration. This is more likely related to autonomic dysfunction rather than a systemic disease. Cogan syndrome comes to mind as it can cause vestibulo-auditory symptoms, interstitial keratitis, and vascular changes. However, the patient's symptoms do not fit exactly with Cogan syndrome. Phantom sweating is a symptom of residual sympathetic activity after sympathectomy, but this patient does not have any prior surgical history. 'Pure' progressive autonomic failure can cause anhydrosis, urinary disturbances, constipation, and impotence, which are not present in this patient. Sleep attacks are not relevant to this patient's symptoms. Cervicogenic headache is a possibility as it can cause unilateral head pain without sideshift, but the patient's symptoms do not fit exactly with cervicogenic headache. Therefore, I think the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms is related to autonomic dysfunction.\",\n\"answer_choice\": A"]
