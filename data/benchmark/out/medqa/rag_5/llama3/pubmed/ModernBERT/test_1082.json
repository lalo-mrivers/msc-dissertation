["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with itchy blisters in the axilla, which he attributes to a poor diet. The physical examination reveals tense axillary bullae that don't rupture with light touch. Direct immunofluorescence shows linear C3 and IgG deposits along the basement membrane. Considering these symptoms and findings, Whipple's disease is unlikely, as it typically presents with progressive cachexia and signs of acute abdomen. Contact dermatitis due to a peripheral intravenous catheter with metallic connector can be ruled out, as there is no history of a peripheral catheter or metal exposure. Acupuncture misdiagnosis complicating cerumen impaction is not relevant here. Chronic factitious illness is also unlikely, as the patient attributes his symptoms to a poor diet and does not have a history of multiple hospitalizations. Finally, considering the linear C3 and IgG deposits along the basement membrane, Bullous pemphigoid becomes the most likely diagnosis.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
