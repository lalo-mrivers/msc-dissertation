["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has a history of hypertension and is taking lisinopril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. He also has type 2 diabetes mellitus and is being treated for pneumonia with azithromycin. The ECG shows polymorphic ventricular tachycardia with cyclic alteration of the QRS axis, which spontaneously resolves after 30 seconds. This suggests a prolonged QT interval, as seen in Long QT syndrome. Additionally, the patient's history of hypertension and use of an ACE inhibitor also increases the risk of QT prolongation. Therefore, it is likely that the patient's syncope is caused by a prolonged QT interval.\", \"answer_choice\": C}"]
