["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 3-day-old male with delayed passage of meconium. He has been feeding well and urinating frequently, but has absent bowel sounds and a distended non-tender abdomen. The patient's mother had spontaneous rupture of membranes at 35 weeks gestation, which could be related to the patient's symptoms. Given the patient's age and lack of obvious dysmorphic features, I think it is unlikely that he has a severe congenital anomaly that would require immediate surgical intervention.
