["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To calculate the number needed to treat (NNT), we need to find the difference in the proportion of participants cured between the two groups. Since there are 500 participants in total and an equal number in each group, let's calculate the proportion of participants cured for each group. For the study treatment group, the proportion is 190/250 = 0.76. For the control group, the proportion is 165/250 = 0.66. The difference between these two proportions is 0.10 (0.76 - 0.66). Since we want to find out how many participants need to be treated with the new drug for one more participant to benefit from it, we can divide the difference in proportion by the absolute difference in proportion. This gives us the NNT.\",\n\"answer_choice\": A"]
