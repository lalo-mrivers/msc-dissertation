["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 32-year-old primigravid woman at 16 weeks' gestation. The quadruple screening test shows maternal serum AFP of 3 times the median and normal levels of serum β-hCG, estriol, and inhibin A. This suggests that the patient has an elevated AFP level, which is a characteristic feature of neural tube defects. Furthermore, the patient's age is not above 34 years, as mentioned in the Merkatz paper, so this factor is unlikely to be the cause of the high AFP levels. The normal levels of serum β-hCG, estriol, and inhibin A rule out partial molar pregnancy and trisomy 21. Trisomy 18 is also an option to consider, but the patient's age and the normal levels of other parameters make this less likely.\", \"answer_choice\": B}"]
