He recognizes that the fear is irrational but still has strong anxiety and distress when confronted with it. Considering the psychological background of psychogenic death, this case does not seem to be related to it. The patient's symptoms are more likely due to his specific phobic response. Alprazolam may help alleviate some of the anxiety symptoms but a deeper approach would be required to address the root cause of his fear.\n\nThe article on Family-centered critical care: an option or obligation? highlights the importance of supporting patients and their families during end-of-life care, which is not directly applicable to this case.
