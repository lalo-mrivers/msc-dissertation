["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is experiencing abdominal bloating, increased frequency of stools, foul-smelling stools, and recurrent dull upper abdominal pain that worsens after meals. He has a history of smoking and heavy alcohol consumption. Given the symptoms and risk factors, I would suspect a possible gastrointestinal issue.
