["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 15-year-old girl with worsening grades and difficulty finding friends at her new high school. She experiences anxiety and avoidance behaviors due to fear of being judged or ridiculed by her classmates. The physical and neurologic examinations show no abnormalities, but the mental status examination reveals that she avoids eye contact and appears uncomfortable and anxious.\n\nConsidering the patient's symptoms and behaviors, it seems that social anxiety disorder is a likely diagnosis. Social anxiety disorder is characterized by excessive and persistent fear of being judged or evaluated by others in social situations, which can lead to avoidance behaviors and physical symptoms such as rapid heartbeat and flushing.\n\nAmong the provided pharmacotherapy options, Propranolol (D) stands out as it is often used off-label for treating performance anxiety and social anxiety disorder.
