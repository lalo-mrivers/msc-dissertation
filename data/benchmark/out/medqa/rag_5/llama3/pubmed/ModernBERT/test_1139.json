["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is presenting with a complex set of symptoms including memory changes, myoclonus, ataxia, paranoia, and hallucinations. Given the history of previous car crash and corneal transplant, it's possible that the patient may have suffered from a traumatic brain injury or post-concussive syndrome.
