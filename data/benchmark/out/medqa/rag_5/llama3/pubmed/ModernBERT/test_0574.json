["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about a diagnosis related to polyanions in glomerular basement membranes. The patient presents with pitting edema and proteinuria exceeding 3.5g in 24 hours. Ebstein's anomaly is not relevant to this case, as it is a cardiac condition. Rieger's syndrome also seems unrelated. Bilaterally small kidneys in shock might be relevant, but the question asks about polyanions in glomerular basement membranes, which is different from that topic. Chronic fascioliasis with destructive cholangitis does not seem related to this case either. Hoffman's syndrome is a condition characterized by adult-onset myxedema, and it does not seem relevant to this patient's symptoms.\n\nThe most likely diagnosis is membranous nephropathy, which would cause loss of polyanions in the glomerular basement membranes. Therefore, we should look for findings that are consistent with membranous nephropathy.\n\nThe options provided do not include membranous nephropathy, but they do include Bence-Jones proteinuria, which is a characteristic of multiple myeloma and does not fit the description of loss of polyanions in glomerular basement membranes. Therefore, we should look at the other options.\n\nSelectively albuminuria (B) is unlikely because it would suggest an isolated kidney problem rather than a problem with polyanions in glomerular basement membranes. WBC casts in the urine (A) are also unlikely because they would be more consistent with acute glomerulonephritis, which would not fit the patient's symptoms of pitting edema and proteinuria exceeding 3.5g in 24 hours.\n\nThe only remaining option is negatively birefringent crystals in the urine (C), which could be a sign of membranous nephropathy.\", \"answer_choice\": C}"]
