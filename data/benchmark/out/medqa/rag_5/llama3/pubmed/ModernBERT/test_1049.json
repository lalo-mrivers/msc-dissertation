["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about bacterial adaptations to the environment. The investigator is studying two isolates of Hemophilus influenzae type B: an infectious isolate and a noninfectious isolate. The noninfectious isolate does not cause symptoms when animals are exposed to it, but when it's cultivated with lysed bacteria from the infectious isolate, some animals develop symptoms. This suggests that the noninfectious isolate is being adapted or changed in some way to become infectious again.\n\nThe key to understanding this process lies in the fact that the investigator is using a culture of lysed bacteria from the infectious isolate. This implies that the noninfectious isolate is somehow 'picking up' traits or characteristics from the infectious isolate, which allows it to cause infection again.\n\nBased on this information, I think the most likely explanation for these findings is...\",\n\n\"answer_choice\": \"B: Reassortment\""]
