["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is experiencing intermittent stabbing face pain that can be triggered by touching her face or brushing her teeth.

Considering the patient's history and symptoms, I think the most likely diagnosis is reflex sympathetic dystrophy (RSD).\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
