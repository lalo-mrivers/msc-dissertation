["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the cellular regeneration of epithelial cells. The tissue sample shows follicles lined by a single layer of cube-like cells with large central nuclei. This morphology is similar to what's described in the document 'A scanning microscope study of vocal cord carcinoma.' Normal vocal cord cells were closely associated and had a smooth surface with microridges. However, malignant cells showed an irregular surface pattern with an abundance of microvilli-like structures of different sizes and shapes. In contrast, the thyroid gland tissue sample shows cube-like cells with large central nuclei, which is similar to the morphology described in follicular lymphoma. The document 'Scanning electron microscopic study of follicular lymphoma' mentions that normal secondary follicles have a smooth surface with microridges, which is also seen in the thyroid gland tissue sample. This suggests that the epithelial cells lining the thyroid gland are cube-like and have large central nuclei, similar to those found in the ovaries.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
