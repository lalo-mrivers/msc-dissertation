["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the normal values for right ventricular pressures. The Swan-Ganz catheter measures pulmonary artery occlusion pressure ('wedge' pressure), which reflects left ventricular preload and pulmonary capillary hydrostatic pressure. However, the wedge pressure recorded (10 mmHg) is not sufficient to determine the systolic pressure of the right ventricle. Therefore, we need to look at a document that provides information about normal values for right ventricular pressures.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C: 10/0 mmHg\""]
