["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the primary function of a specific immunoglobulin found as a dimer. The given documents are about different proteins and their properties, but none of them specifically mention immunoglobulins or their functions. However, one document mentions G-myeloma protein, which is characterized by its conformation differing from the donor immunoglobulin G. This suggests that this protein may be an immunoglobulin. Since it's mentioned to differ in conformation and having a more polar surrounding of the molecule tyrosine and tryptophane residua, it seems to have some distinct properties compared to other immunoglobulins.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
