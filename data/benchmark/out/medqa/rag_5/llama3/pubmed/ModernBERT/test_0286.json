["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about detecting the genetic material of HIV if the child was infected. Since the mother is HIV positive, it's possible that the child may have been infected during pregnancy or delivery. The assays listed are all related to testing for HIV, but not all detect the genetic material of HIV. ELISA and rapid HIV antibody test would likely be positive due to maternal transmission, but they don't directly detect the genetic material of HIV. Southern blot is an older technique that detects specific DNA sequences by size separation, which may be useful in this case. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a highly sensitive and specific molecular biology technique that amplifies specific DNA sequences, making it suitable for detecting the genetic material of HIV.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
