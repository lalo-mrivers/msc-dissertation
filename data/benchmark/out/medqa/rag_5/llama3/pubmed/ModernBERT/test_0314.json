["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 26-year-old woman with recurring episodes of sneezing, congestion, and itchy eyes. She exercises regularly and eats a plant-based diet with no carbonated drinks. The symptoms are persistent over the past year and there's no fever, sick contacts, or other significant complaints. This information suggests an allergic reaction rather than an infection. Exercise-induced anaphylaxis is a condition characterized by pruritus, flushing, urticaria, and increase in histamine levels during physical exertion. Considering the patient's plant-based diet and exercise habits, it's possible that her symptoms are related to exercise-induced anaphylaxis.

Therefore, a short-acting beta-2 agonist is likely to be prescribed to alleviate her symptoms.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
