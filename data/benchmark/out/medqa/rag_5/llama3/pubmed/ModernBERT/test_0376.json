["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 3-month-old girl with a productive cough, watery stools, and white plaques on the tongue and palate. She was delivered vaginally at 38 weeks' gestation at home and has not received any prenatal care or immunizations. The mother reports that her child is not gaining weight. Given the symptoms and lack of prenatal care, congenital cytomegalic inclusion disease may be a possible diagnosis.
