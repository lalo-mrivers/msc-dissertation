["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 56-year-old man with a history of non-small cell lung cancer. He has subacute back pain that started after an amateur weight-lifting competition 2 months ago. The patient's physical exam is unremarkable except for point tenderness along the lumbosacral area. Given his history of lung cancer, I think of primary neurogenic retroperitoneal tumors, such as a malignant schwannoma, which can present with back pain and radiate to other areas. Additionally, the patient's symptoms are consistent with ulnar nerve compression at the elbow, but this is not a typical location for such compression. Therefore, I focus on the possibility of a primary tumor.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
