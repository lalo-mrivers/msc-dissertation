["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with persistent epigastric pain, worse after eating, and a family history of similar symptoms. The vital signs are normal except for mild epigastric tenderness on physical examination. A metabolic panel reveals normal serum sodium, potassium, calcium, and bicarbonate levels. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy shows multiple duodenal ulcers.
