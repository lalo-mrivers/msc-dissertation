["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is an 18-month-old boy with an abdominal mass. The diagnosis of intermediate-risk neuroblastoma has been confirmed through biopsy. The parents are refusing neoadjuvant chemotherapy due to concerns about side effects. As a physician, my primary concern is the child's well-being and potential outcome. I will consider the options presented: A) supportive care at home; B) referral to another oncologist; C) giving parents time to think about their decision; D) seeking a court order for neoadjuvant chemotherapy.
