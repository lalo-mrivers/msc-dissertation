["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has had unprotected intercourse with her boyfriend the previous day. She is allergic to certain jewelry and metal alloys but takes no medications. A urine pregnancy test is negative. The patient does not wish to become pregnant until she finishes college in six months. Given this information, we need to consider emergency contraception options. Mifepristone and ulipristal acetate are not options for emergency contraception as they require a confirmed pregnancy diagnosis. Depot medroxyprogesterone acetate is also not suitable as it is a long-acting injectable contraceptive that takes several days to take effect. A copper-containing intra-uterine device (IUD) is the most appropriate option for emergency contraception, as it can be inserted up to 5 days after unprotected intercourse and is effective in preventing pregnancy.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
