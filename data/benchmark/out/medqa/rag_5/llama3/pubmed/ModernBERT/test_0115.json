["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the step in cross-bridge cycling that would be most likely blocked by a drug that selectively inhibits phosphate release by the myosin head. The key information from the provided documents is that the myosin head's enzymatic ATPase activity is coupled to the resulting mechanical impulses, and that the back stroke of myosin bridges in a contracting fibre is determined by nucleotide binding. Therefore, if phosphate release is inhibited, it would most likely block the power stroke.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
