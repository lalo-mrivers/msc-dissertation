["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Given the patient's systemic vascular resistance of 35 mm Hg Ã— min/L with an end-systolic volume of 80 mL, we can infer that the cardiac index is low. A high systemic vascular resistance indicates peripheral vasoconstriction, which would further reduce blood flow and increase pressure. This combination suggests a reduced ejection fraction.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
