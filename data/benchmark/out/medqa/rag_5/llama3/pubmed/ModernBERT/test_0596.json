["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The case starts with a newborn boy delivered via Caesarian section with meconium-stained amniotic fluid. The symptoms suggest respiratory distress, which is resolved by an inhaled medication that increases smooth muscle cGMP. Three hours later, the baby becomes tachypneic again and shows blue-grey discoloration of the lips, fingers, and toes, indicating cyanosis. This suggests a possible closure or constriction of a ductus arteriosus. In this context, an older case report about subcutaneous fat necrosis of the newborn (SFNN) can be relevant. The symptoms in that case, such as hypoglycemia, pneumonia, oliguria, thrombocytopenia, seizures, and urinary infection, are different from those observed here. However, it is worth noting that SFNN is associated with an increase in myoglobin concentration, which could contribute to the cyanosis. Nevertheless, the primary cause of the infant's cyanosis is more likely related to a physiological change rather than an increase in serum myoglobin.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
