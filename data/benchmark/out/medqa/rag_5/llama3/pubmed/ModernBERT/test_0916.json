["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with substernal chest pain after drinking 2 glasses of whiskey, which may be a trigger for coronary spasm. The ECG shows ST-segment elevations in the anterior leads, which could be due to coronary artery vasospasm or atherosclerotic plaque rupture. However, the fact that the chest pain resolved and the repeat ECG showed no abnormalities suggests that it is unlikely to be due to atherosclerotic plaque rupture. Furthermore, the patient's history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia increases the likelihood of coronary artery vasospasm. Therefore, the most likely underlying mechanism of this patient's chest pain is coronary artery vasospasm.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
