["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has a male fetus with likely intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), microcephaly, convex-rounded feet, clenched fists with overlapping fingers, and a medium-sized ventricular septal defect (VSD). These findings are indicative of an abnormality in the development of the MÃ¼llerian duct system. Given these findings, it is likely that this patient has some type of uterine anomaly. One such anomaly is uterus unicornis with uterus solidaris, which is known to be associated with microcephaly and IUGR. Additionally, VSD is a common finding in patients with this anomaly. Therefore, the most likely additional finding would be an uterus unicornis with uterus solidaris.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
