["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question describes the breast tissue of pregnant women showing an increased number of acinar glands with epithelial proliferation. This is likely due to hormonal changes during pregnancy. The study on recurrent extreme breast involution following pregnancy and susceptibility to breast cancer suggests that estrogen levels increase during pregnancy, which may stimulate breast growth. Similarly, the study on frequency of X-chromatin in pregnant women during the second trimester of gestation shows an increased frequency of X-chromatin, indicating higher estrogen levels. Therefore, it is likely that the hormonal changes during pregnancy are responsible for the observed change in breast tissue.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
