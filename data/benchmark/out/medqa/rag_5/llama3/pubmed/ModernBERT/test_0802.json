["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the ages of three patients. We need to analyze the descriptions of each patient's abilities and behaviors to determine their ages.\n\nPatient 1 can lift his head and chest when prone, track an object with his eyes to midline, and has yellow stools that are not straining. This suggests he is around 3-4 months old.\n\nPatient 2 can roll from supine to prone, transfer a rattle from hand to hand, but cannot say any words. This is consistent with a child around 6-7 months old.\n\nPatient 3 takes independent steps at home and recognizes object names but cannot follow directions. He seems to be around 9-10 months old based on his ability to walk independently and understand object names.\n\nBy comparing these descriptions, we can determine the ages of each patient.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
