["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with symptoms of fatigue, weakness, and hypercortisolism. The laboratory results show elevated cortisol levels and a lack of suppression after a high dose dexamethasone suppression trial. This suggests the presence of Cushing's syndrome.\n\nThe patient does not have any obvious signs of Cushing's syndrome such as truncal obesity or purple striae, but the laboratory results suggest the presence of hypercortisolism.\n\nGiven the patient's symptoms and laboratory results, the next step in management should be to confirm the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome.\n\nAn MRI of the adrenal glands is not necessary at this point as it would not provide any additional information that would aid in the diagnosis or management of the patient.\n\nA low dose dexamethasone suppression test may also not be necessary at this point as the high dose dexamethasone suppression trial has already shown that the patient's cortisol levels do not decrease, suggesting hypercortisolism.\n\nInferior petrosal sinus sampling is a diagnostic procedure that can help to confirm the presence of Cushing's syndrome. It involves sampling blood from the inferior petrosal sinuses and comparing it to blood samples taken from the femoral vein.\n\nGiven the patient's symptoms and laboratory results, the best next step in management would be to perform an inferior petrosal sinus sampling.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
