["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 25-year-old primigravida who presented with a generalized tonic-clonic seizure at 36 weeks gestation. She has no history of convulsive disorders and the antepartum course has been unremarkable. The physical examination shows leg and perineal edema, symmetric upper and lower extremity hyperreflexia, and ankle clonus. Given the patient's symptoms and physical findings, we can consider several possible diagnoses, including preeclampsia, eclampsia, or a seizure disorder.

Preeclampsia can cause seizures, headaches, and changes in laboratory values such as hyponatremia.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
