["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has a history of adult polycystic kidney disease and was on maintenance hemodialysis prior to transplantation. He is currently taking azathioprine, cyclosporine, prednisone, and enalapril. His symptoms include pain in the right lower abdomen, generalized fatigue, decreasing urinary output, and elevated creatinine levels. The biopsy of the transplanted kidney shows tubulitis, but C4d staining is negative.\n\nThe patient's current medications include ACE inhibitors (enalapril), which can cause rapid deterioration of renal function. Given his history of kidney disease and medication regimen, it is possible that enalapril contributed to his current findings.\n\nHowever, the patient also has a history of adult polycystic kidney disease, which could be contributing to his symptoms.\n\nThe absence of C4d staining suggests that antibody-mediated rejection is unlikely.\n\nGiven these factors, drug-induced nephrotoxicity due to enalapril appears to be a possible explanation for the patient's findings.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
