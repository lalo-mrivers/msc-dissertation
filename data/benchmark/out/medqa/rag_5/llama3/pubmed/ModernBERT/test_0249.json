["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks how the positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) of the diagnostic test will be affected if the prevalence of CMV retinitis decreases due to increased access to antiretroviral therapy. The PPV is the proportion of true positives among all positive tests, while the NPV is the proportion of true negatives among all negative tests. Since the prevalence of CMV retinitis decreases, there will be fewer true positives and more false negatives. This means that the PPV will decrease because a larger proportion of positive tests will be false positives. On the other hand, the NPV will increase because a smaller proportion of negative tests will be false negatives. Therefore, the correct answer is B: PPV decreases, NPV increases.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
