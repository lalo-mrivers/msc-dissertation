["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms are consistent with pericarditis. The pain is sharp, severe, and radiates to the shoulders and neck, which suggests inflammation of the pericardium. The patient has a history of smoking and occasional alcohol consumption, which may be related to the development of pericarditis. The physical exam finding of a scratching sound over the left sternal border at end-expiration with the patient leaning forward is consistent with pericardial friction rub. The chest X-ray is normal, but the ECG suggests ST segment elevation, which can be seen in pericarditis.\n\nGiven these findings, indomethacin or ibuprofen may be effective in reducing inflammation and alleviating symptoms. Pericardiocentesis or pericardiectomy are not necessary for this patient.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A: Indomethacin +/- omeprazole\"\n}"]
