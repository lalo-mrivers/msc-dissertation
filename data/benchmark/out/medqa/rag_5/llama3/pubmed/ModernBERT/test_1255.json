["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the patient's symptoms and examination findings, it is likely that she has a condition affecting the oculomotor nerve or the optic nerve. The patient's left eye shows no response to light, indicating damage to the optic pathway. Since her right eye is normal, it suggests that the problem is specific to the left eye. Given the patient's history of SLE and the sudden onset of symptoms, an autoimmune disorder affecting the eye could be a possibility. However, without further information, we cannot conclude with certainty what is causing the patient's symptoms.\n\nNext, let's look at the potential causes of vision loss in one eye. Eye histoplasmosis is mentioned as a common but little-known entity that can cause distortion and blurring of central vision in one eye. However, this condition typically affects healthy adults in their 30s and 40s, which does not match the patient's age.\n\nWe also have a case report on psychogenic visual disorders in an abused child, where the patient had uncorrected visual acuity of 20/800 in both eyes and showed no improvement with correction. This patient was found to have neurasthenic spiral fields superimposed on hysterical tubular contractions of both eyes.\n\nFurthermore, we have a case report on atypical post-attack symptoms in closed-angle glaucoma, where the patient presented with diminution of visual acuity and synekies in semi-myriasis after a leg fracture. This condition would require further evaluation to confirm.\n\nFinally, we have a case report on bilateral direct injury of oculomotor nerves in craniocerebral trauma, where the patient showed bilateral abduction of eyeballs without any motility.\n\nConsidering all these possibilities and the patient's symptoms, we cannot rule out an organic lesion affecting the left eye. Therefore, further evaluation is necessary to determine the cause of the patient's vision loss.\n\nThe correct answer choice would be B: Miosis of the right eye only.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
