["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is an 81-year-old man who has been experiencing progressive memory issues over the last several years. His symptoms have recently worsened. He also complains of difficulty seeing out of his right eye, but this resolves by the next day. The patient has a history of left basal ganglia hemorrhage and right middle cerebral artery infarction, which could be contributing to his cognitive decline. He is alert and oriented, but unable to perform simple arithmetic calculations and has reduced muscle strength on the right side with exaggerated reflexes. Based on these symptoms, it seems likely that the patient's cognitive impairment is related to his previous strokes rather than a primary neurodegenerative disorder such as Alzheimer's disease or Lewy body dementia.
