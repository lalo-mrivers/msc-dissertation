["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with symptoms of Cushing syndrome (truncal weight gain, facial hair growth, thinning skin, and hypertension). The suspicion is a pituitary adenoma. A dexamethasone test can help confirm this by assessing the suppression of ACTH levels. Low-dose dexamethasone suppresses ACTH production in normal subjects but not in patients with Cushing's syndrome. Therefore, low-dose dexamethasone would likely show increased or no change in ACTH levels in this patient.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C: Low-dose, no change in ACTH; high-dose, no change in ACTH\""]
