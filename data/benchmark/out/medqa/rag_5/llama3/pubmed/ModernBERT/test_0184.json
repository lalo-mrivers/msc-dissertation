The mental status examination shows psychomotor retardation, blunted affect, impaired short- and long-term memory, attention, and concentration. There are no focal neurologic findings, and other potential causes such as electrolyte imbalance, hypothyroidism, or vitamin B12 deficiency have been ruled out.\n\nConsidering the patient's symptoms and the fact that he has hypertension treated with amlodipine, the most likely diagnosis is dementia possibly due to vascular changes.
