["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the reason for conjugating capsular polysaccharides to protein carriers during vaccine development. The author does not provide direct information on this topic from the given documents. However, we can analyze the provided papers and find relevant information related to immunoprophylaxis and vaccine development. One of the papers mentions the production of a live cell culture adsorbate vaccine against herpes mammillitis in cattle, which used aluminum hydroxide and Freund's adjuvant as adjuvants. This suggests that adjuvants play a crucial role in enhancing vaccine immunogenicity.\n\nAnother paper discusses the development of a live drug-controlled vaccine against bovine babesiosis using Mongolian gerbils. The study investigated different routes of infection, including subcutaneous injection, which resulted in the greatest host response. This implies that the route of administration can affect vaccine efficacy.\n\nThe concept of conjugation is not directly discussed in these papers, but we can infer that conjugating capsular polysaccharides to protein carriers may be done to enhance their immunogenicity and improve their ability to stimulate a protective immune response.\",\n\"answer_choice\": A"]
