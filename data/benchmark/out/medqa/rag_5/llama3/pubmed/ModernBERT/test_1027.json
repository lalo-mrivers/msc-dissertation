["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To calculate the loading dose of heparin, we need to know its volume of distribution (Vd) which is 60 mL/kg. The target peak plasma concentration is 0.5 units/mL. We can use the formula: Loading dose = Peak plasma concentration / Vd.\n\nFirst, let's convert the patient's weight from kg to grams: 50-kg * 1000 g/kg = 50,000 g or 50 g.\n\nNow, we can plug in the values: Loading dose = 0.5 units/mL / (60 mL/kg * 50 g/1,000 g) = 3.75 units/g\n\nSince the patient weighs 110 lb which is approximately 49.9 kg (or 50-kg), we can round up to the nearest hundred: 4,000 units.\n\nThe most appropriate loading dose for this patient would be around 4,000 units.\",\n\"answer_choice\": A"]
