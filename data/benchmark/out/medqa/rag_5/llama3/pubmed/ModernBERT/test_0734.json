["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 10-year-old girl with HIV who has been experiencing difficulty breathing, dry cough, and low-grade fevers for a week. She also developed shallow erythematous ulcers inside her mouth. The patient's CD4 count is 100/mm3, which indicates immunosuppression.
