["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient developed severe abdominal cramping and bloody diarrhea after consuming undercooked ground beef. The likely toxin-mediated mechanism of this disease process is the production of Shiga toxin by E. coli O157:H7, which can cause hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). This toxin inhibits protein synthesis in gastrointestinal mucosal cells by binding to the 60S ribosomal subunit, leading to cell death and damage. Therefore, option D: Inhibition of the 60S ribosomal subunit, resulting in decreased protein synthesis in gastrointestinal mucosal cells is the most likely explanation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
