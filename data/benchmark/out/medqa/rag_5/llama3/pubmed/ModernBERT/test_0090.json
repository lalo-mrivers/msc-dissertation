["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is described as having a 3-week history of intermittent loose stools and a 1.2-kg (2.6-lb) weight loss. The physical examination reveals diffuse tenderness with no guarding or rebound, suggesting an inflammatory process in the abdomen. The presence of oval-shaped eggs with lateral spines on stool culture suggests parasitic infection. Microscopic examination of liver biopsy specimen shows granulomatous inflammation with periportal fibrosis, indicating a liver involvement.\n\nThe patient's history of immigrating to the US from Uganda 6 weeks ago and the laboratory findings strongly suggest that the patient has schistosomiasis (bilharzia), which is caused by the parasitic worms Schistosoma mansoni or S. japonicum.\n\nFreshwater snails are the intermediate hosts for these parasites, and infection occurs through skin contact with contaminated water. Therefore, exposure to freshwater snails is most likely to have played a role in the development of this patient's symptoms.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: Freshwater snails\""]
