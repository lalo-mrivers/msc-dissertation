["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question describes a stillborn infant with a small pelvis, shallow intergluteal cleft, and club feet, along with the absence of sacrum and lumbar vertebrae on x-ray. This combination is highly suggestive of campomelic syndrome, which is characterized by abnormal formation of the sacrum, lumbar spine, and long bones. The case reports provided describe similar features in infants with campomelic syndrome.
