["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the characteristic of fexofenadine that makes it less sedating than diphenhydramine. Diphenhydramine is an antihistamine with sedative properties, while fexofenadine is a non-sedating antihistamine. The relevant documents do not mention the exact mechanism of fexofenadine's action, but they do describe its use in reversing respiratory depression caused by ethanol ingestion and in treating allergic reactions. In this case, it seems that fexofenadine does not have alpha-adrenergic antagonism, beta-adrenergic antagonism, serotonergic antagonism, or any other mechanism that would directly address sedation. Therefore, the characteristic of fexofenadine that makes it less sedating than diphenhydramine is its relative lipophobicity.\", \"answer_choice\": C}"]
