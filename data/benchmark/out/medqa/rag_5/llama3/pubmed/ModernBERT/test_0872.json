["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The splenic artery was damaged at its origin from the celiac trunk. Ligation of the splenic artery means that blood flow to the spleen will be disrupted. The splenic artery is a branch of the celiac trunk, which also gives rise to the common hepatic artery and the left gastric artery. Since the damage is at the origin of the splenic artery from the celiac trunk, this implies that the common hepatic artery and the left gastric artery are still intact. The gastroduodenal artery arises from the common hepatic artery, so it will also be unaffected. The left gastroepiploic artery is a branch of the splenic artery, so it will also be hypoperfused. Therefore, the only option that is not affected by ligation of the splenic artery at its origin is\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
