["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about a healthy 20-year-old man who is exercising on a treadmill. His heart rate increases from 70/min to 130/min and blood pressure changes from 114/74 mm Hg to 145/75 mm Hg after stopping his run. We need to find the most likely cause of this change. The relevant documents describe physical training, exercise and heart rates. The effect of various levels of strenuous to exhaustive exercise on reaction time shows that increased exercise leads to an increase in heart rate. Physical training: comparative responses of middle-aged adults indicates that maximal oxygen uptake (VO2 max) and heart rates during submaximal exercise are measured. The data suggest that sedentary middle-aged women respond to vigorous physical training much like sedentary middle-aged men do.\n\nThe relevant data here is the increased heart rate from 70/min to 130/min after stopping his run. This suggests that the most likely cause of this change is the sympathetic nervous system activation, which is responsible for increasing heart rate during exercise and immediately after exercise when the body returns to a resting state.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"]
