["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the substance released locally to increase coronary blood flow during exertion. The relevant documents mention various conditions such as desquamating interstitial pneumonia, shrinking lungs syndrome, and pulmonary embolism, but none of these directly relate to coronary blood flow. However, we do have a section on high-voltage electrical burns, which mentions diffuse bilateral brain damage and hypertension. This is not related to coronary blood flow either. The most relevant information comes from the case report on perforating granuloma annulare, where it mentions therapeutic success with topical steroids with occlusion and systemic prednisone. However, this is also unrelated to coronary blood flow. Therefore, we need to rely on general medical knowledge to answer this question. During exertion, the body releases substances that increase coronary blood flow to meet the increased oxygen demand of the heart muscle. Adenosine is known to play a role in regulating coronary blood flow by dilating coronary vessels and increasing blood flow.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
