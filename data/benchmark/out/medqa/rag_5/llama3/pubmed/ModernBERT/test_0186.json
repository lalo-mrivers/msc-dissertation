["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The laboratory has biochemically charged a Lys-tRNA with valine instead of lysine. This means that the tRNA is carrying an amino acid that it was not meant to carry. The mRNA sequence contains only codons for lysine, which means that the ribosome will try to incorporate the correct amino acid according to the genetic code. However, since the tRNA carries valine instead of lysine, the ribosome will recognize this mischarged tRNA and still attempt to incorporate it into the growing peptide. Since the mRNA sequence contains only codons for lysine, the mischarged tRNA with valine will be incorporated in the codons that specify for lysine.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
