["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for the probability that a subject will have a hemoglobin concentration greater than 18 g/dL. We are given a normal distribution of hemoglobin concentrations with a mean of 17 g/dL and a standard error of 0.1 g/dL. To find the probability, we can use the z-score formula: z = (x - μ) / σ, where x is the value we're interested in (18 g/dL), μ is the mean (17 g/dL), and σ is the standard deviation. Since the distribution is normal, 95% of the values will fall within 2 standard deviations of the mean. Since 18 g/dL is more than 1 standard deviation above the mean, we can conclude that it's an extreme value.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
