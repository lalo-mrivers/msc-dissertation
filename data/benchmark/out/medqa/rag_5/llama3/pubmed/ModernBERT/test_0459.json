["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination, I suspect an apophyseal fracture of the lumbar spine. The pain is localized to the right hip and knee joints, which suggests a mechanical issue rather than a systemic disease. The plain radiographs showing displacement of the right femoral head inferoposterior off the femoral neck also support this diagnosis. Since the patient has already had three weeks of mild pain followed by acute worsening, I think it's likely that the fracture occurred during that time.\n\nI will rule out other possibilities such as reflex sympathetic dystrophy based on the lack of tenderness to palpation and no joint erythema, edema or effusion present. Additionally, the laboratory tests are unremarkable which makes it less likely that there is a systemic inflammatory condition.\n\nGiven the patient's age and the presence of apophyseal fracture, I think surgical pinning of the right hip is the most appropriate course of treatment.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
