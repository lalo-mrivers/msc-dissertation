["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents provide information on various topics such as dribble control for spastic children, the management of hyperactive children, infant recognition of mother's voice, assessment of weight and gestational age, and prevention of bed sores. However, none of these topics seem directly related to a one-week-old infant with yellow skin and crying several times per day. The only relevant information is that the mother has been breastfeeding exclusively. Therefore, we need to look for clues in the provided scenario that might indicate the cause of the yellow skin (jaundice). Typically, jaundice in newborns is caused by an excess of bilirubin in the blood, which can be due to various reasons such as a delay in the breakdown of bilirubin or inadequate breastfeeding. Since the mother reports that her daughter feeds well and sleeps 7-8 hours at night without interruption, it suggests that the baby is likely receiving adequate nutrition through breastfeeding. However, we still need to consider other possible causes of jaundice. Based on this analysis, we can conclude that the best treatment for this condition is not related to phenobarbital administration, plasma exchange, or switching from breast milk to formula. Instead, it suggests that the mother should be advised to continue normal breastfeeding and also consult a pediatrician if the baby's condition does not improve or worsens.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
