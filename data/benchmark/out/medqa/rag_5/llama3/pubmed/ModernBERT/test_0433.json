She presents with a yellow-green vaginal discharge, mild pelvic and abdominal pain, cervical motion tenderness, and a pink and inflamed nulliparous cervix with small red punctate spots. A wet mount reveals numerous squamous cells and motile organisms. Given the patient's symptoms and examination findings, it is likely that she has a sexually-transmitted infection.
