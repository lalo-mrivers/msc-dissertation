["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about a 23-year-old woman with episodic headaches, dizziness, nausea, and vomiting. An MRI shows isolated dilation of the left lateral ventricle. This suggests that there's blockage somewhere in the brain. The answer should be related to cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow or pressure. From the given options, we can rule out median aperture as it's not directly related to CSF flow. Lateral apertures are small holes at the base of the skull that allow CSF to drain from the subarachnoid space into the venous circulation, but the dilation is in the lateral ventricle, so this option is unlikely too. Interventricular foramen connects the lateral ventricles and allows CSF to flow out. Arachnoid villi are small projections on the arachnoid membrane that allow CSF to drain from the subarachnoid space into the venous circulation. Blockade of these structures would lead to increased pressure in the ventricles, causing dilation.\",\n\"answer_choice\": A"]
