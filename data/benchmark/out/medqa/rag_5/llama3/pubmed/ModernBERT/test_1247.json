["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for the total volume of gas that does not participate in gas exchange. This can be calculated as the sum of residual volume (RV) and functional reserve capacity (FRC). Given the values provided, RV = 1,000 mL and FRC = 2,700 mL. Therefore, the total volume of gas that does not participate in gas exchange is RV + FRC = 3,700 mL.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: 1200 mL\"\n}"]
