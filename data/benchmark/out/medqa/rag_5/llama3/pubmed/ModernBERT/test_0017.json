["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about a study that aimed to identify risk factors for Brief Resolved Unexplained Events (BRUE) in infants. The pediatrician wanted to control confounding bias in the study. Confounding bias occurs when there are differences between the two groups being compared that could affect the results of the study. In this case, the pediatrician was aware of several potential confounders, including age, socioeconomic background, and family history of medical illness.\n\nTo control for these confounders, the pediatrician recruited 75 infants under 1 year of age with BRUE and 75 infants without BRUE who had the same age, socioeconomic background, and family history of medical illness. This is an example of matching, which involves pairing cases with controls based on similar characteristics.\n\nThis method helps to ensure that any differences between the two groups are due to the variable being studied (in this case, BRUE), rather than other factors. By controlling for these confounders, the study can provide a more accurate picture of the relationship between BRUE and the variables being studied.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
