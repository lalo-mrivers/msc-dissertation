["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 4-month-old infant with sudden onset of nose bleeding without trauma, multiple bruising, and tiny red spots on the upper and lower extremities. The physical exam shows pale skin color, petechiae, and ecchymosis. The complete blood count results show normal hemoglobin and hematocrit levels, but a high platelet count. The coagulation test results are also normal. The blood smear shows hypochromia, poikilocytosis, and large platelets, while the platelet aggregation test with ristocetin is normal. Considering these findings, we can rule out von Willebrand disease (choice A) since it typically presents with a prolonged bleeding time. Glanzmann's thrombasthenia (choice B) is also unlikely given the normal coagulation tests. Bernard-Soulier disease (choice C) is possible due to the presence of large platelets and hypochromia on the blood smear, but scurvy (choice D) is a more likely diagnosis considering the patient's age, history of bruising, and laboratory findings.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\"\n}"]
