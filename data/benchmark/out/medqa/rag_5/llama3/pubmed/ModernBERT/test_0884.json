["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the location of ribosomes in protein-secreting cells. The relevant documents mention the rough endoplasmic reticulum (ER) as a principal site of membrane biogenesis and the insertion of proteins into the membrane of the ER is mediated by a resident proteinaceous machinery. Additionally, the process of transporting proteins across the endoplasmic reticulum membrane involves targeting to translocation sites in the ER. Therefore, it can be inferred that ribosomes are located in the rough endoplasmic reticulum.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
