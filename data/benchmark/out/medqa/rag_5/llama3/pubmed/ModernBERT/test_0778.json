["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about a resident's moonlighting and patient safety. The Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) sets standards for residents' work hours. The resident currently works 60 hours per week as a resident, with an additional 10-hour shift on Saturdays. Sundays are free of any obligations.\n\nThe ACGME standard is 80 hours per week. Therefore, this resident is already within the allowed limits.\n\nConsidering that the resident wants to gain more experience and pay for medical school loans, it seems reasonable to assume they want to work a few extra hours.
