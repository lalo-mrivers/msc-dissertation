["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has a pink bump on his forehead that rapidly developed over the last month. He had significant sun exposure including multiple blistering sunburns. The physical examination reveals a 2 cm dome-shaped plaque with a central keratin plug. Excisional biopsy of the lesion reveals an exophytic nodule with central invagination, full of keratin. Keratinocyte atypia is minimal.\\r\\n\\r\\nConsidering the patient's history of sun exposure and the clinical presentation, porokeratosis is suspected. The histological findings are also consistent with porokeratosis, which typically shows an exophytic nodule with central invagination and full of keratin.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition, the patient's age (67 years old) is consistent with the typical age range for patients with disseminated superficial actinic porokeratosis (DSAP).\\r\\n\\r\\nGiven the above information, DSAP is a strong possibility.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
