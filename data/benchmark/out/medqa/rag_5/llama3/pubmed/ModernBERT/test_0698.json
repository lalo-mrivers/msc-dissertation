["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is experiencing difficulty concentrating at work, fatigue, changes in appetite and interest in activities, and speech slowing. He has a history of deployment to Afghanistan 2 years ago. These symptoms are reminiscent of those described in the papers on brain disorders, spinal cord injury, and post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The patient's symptoms do not suggest any acute or sudden onset, but rather a gradual decline over time. Therefore, I will focus on chronic conditions that can arise from PTSD.

Based on these findings, the most likely diagnosis is Post traumatic stress disorder.\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
