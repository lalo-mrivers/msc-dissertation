["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's speech is fluent while speaking and he can comprehend one and two step instructions. However, he remains unable to complete tasks involving verbal repetition. This suggests that the problem is not with language processing or comprehension but rather with verbal repetition.
