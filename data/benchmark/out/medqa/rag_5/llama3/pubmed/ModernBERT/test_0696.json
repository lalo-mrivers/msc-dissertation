["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's fasting blood glucose level is 120 mg/dL and two-hour post 75g glucose load blood glucose level is 190 mg/dL, indicating impaired glucose tolerance. This is a risk factor for developing diabetes. As the patient is already overweight (BMI = 34 kg/m^2), lifestyle modification with diet therapy is recommended to prevent or delay progression to type II diabetes. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) is involved in glucose and lipid metabolism, and activation of PPARγ increases insulin sensitivity. Therefore, increased levels of endogenous signaling molecules or receptors that activate PPARγ would be expected to increase insulin sensitivity in this patient.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
