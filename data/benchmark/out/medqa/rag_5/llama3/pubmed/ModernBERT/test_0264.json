["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient had a severe construction accident and was unconscious with a large metal spike protruding from his abdomen. He then had surgery to remove the foreign body and control bleeding. During surgery, he had an acute drop in blood pressure with ST elevations on ECG, which resolved with fluid resuscitation and blood transfusions. The patient remained sedated after surgery until his third day in ICU when he experienced oxygen desaturation despite being on a respirator. Auscultation showed bilateral air entry with crackles and a systolic murmur was heard. Swan-Ganz catheter readings showed normal central venous pressure, right ventricular pressure, pulmonary artery pressure, and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure. Chest x-ray shows evidence of lung edema (Image A). Given the patient's clinical scenario and radiographic findings, the most likely direct cause of his death is diffuse alveolar damage.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
