["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the inheritance pattern of mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR) gene. The Î”F508 mutation is commonly found, and a novel mutation is also present in the population under study. To determine if these two loci are closely linked, we would need to perform linkage analysis. Linkage analysis involves calculating a LOD score, which measures the likelihood that the two genes are linked. A higher LOD score indicates stronger evidence for linkage.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
