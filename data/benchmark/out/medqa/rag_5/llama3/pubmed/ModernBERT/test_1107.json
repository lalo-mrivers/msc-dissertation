["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is 76 years old with a history of hypertension. There's no indication of smoking or illicit drug use. The physical examination shows no abnormalities. Considering the age and normal physical examination, we need to focus on the changes that occur naturally with aging. One major change in respiratory function that occurs with aging is decreased lung compliance. As we get older, our lungs become less elastic, making it harder for them to expand fully. This can lead to a decrease in forced vital capacity (FVC) and forced expiratory volume at one second (FEV1). Another option could be increased A-a gradient due to age-related changes in gas exchange. However, the main change is decreased lung compliance.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
