["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with symptoms of shortness of breath and chest pain that worsens with inspiration. She recently traveled from New York to the west coast for an Economics conference. Given her recent travel history, I consider the possibility of a pulmonary embolism (PE). The physical examination shows decreased air movement on the right side of the lung, which is consistent with PE. Her vital signs are normal except for tachycardia, which can be a sign of PE. The patient's medical history and other symptoms do not suggest any other possible causes for her symptoms.\n\nNext, I would consider ordering an imaging study to confirm or rule out PE. Given the recent travel history and the physical examination findings, CT pulmonary angiogram (D) is the best next step in evaluating this patient.\", \"answer_choice\": D}"]
