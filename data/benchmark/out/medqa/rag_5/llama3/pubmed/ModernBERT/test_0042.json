["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with bilious vomiting, no passed meconium, and a history of decreased maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) on the quadruple screen. This suggests that the fetus may have an intestinal obstruction or abnormality. The physical exam findings of a firm and distended abdomen with hypoactive bowel sounds also support this possibility. Given these findings, I will consider the options: duodenal atresia, meconium ileus, necrotizing enterocolitis, and pyloric stenosis. Duodenal atresia is a plausible option as it can present with vomiting and abdominal distension. Meconium ileus could also be considered given the presence of bilious vomiting. However, this patient does not have any other symptoms suggestive of cystic fibrosis or meconium peritonitis. Necrotizing enterocolitis is unlikely given that the baby's temperature is normal. Pyloric stenosis can present with non-bilous vomiting but typically has a more typical presentation without abdominal distension. Based on the patient's history and physical exam findings, I think duodenal atresia is the most likely etiology.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
