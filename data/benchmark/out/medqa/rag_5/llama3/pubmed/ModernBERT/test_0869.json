["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the population attributable proportion (PAP) which is used to estimate the percentage of disease that can be prevented if a particular risk factor is removed. First, we need to calculate the odds ratio (OR). The OR is calculated as the ratio of the probability of developing GERD among alcoholics and non-alcoholics. In this case, OR = 30/200 / 30/400 = 1.\n\nSince there is no association between alcohol use and GERD, the PAP is equal to 2(0 - 0.3) = 0.6 or 60%. This means that if alcohol consumption were eliminated in this town, approximately 60% of GERD cases could be prevented.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
