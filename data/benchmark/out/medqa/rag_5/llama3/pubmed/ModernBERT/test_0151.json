["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the ovarian findings of a transvaginal ultrasound showing an intrauterine heteroechoic mass with numerous anechoic spaces and no identifiable fetus or amniotic fluid. Both ovaries are enlarged and have multiple thin-walled, septated cysts with clear content. Since it is a fetal presentation and the uterus contains a mass, it suggests that there might be a Mullerian duct anomaly. Considering the ovarian findings, we can think of possible causes. The presence of multiple thin-walled, septated cysts with clear content makes me think of a syndrome characterized by bilateral fallopian tubes, a uterus, and a vagina that drains into the prostatic utricle.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
