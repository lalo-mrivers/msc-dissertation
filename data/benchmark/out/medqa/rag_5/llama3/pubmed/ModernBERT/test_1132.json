["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with a bilateral headache that is worsened by coughing or laughing. The headaches are accompanied by a runny nose and temperature elevation 3 weeks ago, which suggests a possible link to the acute illness. The patient has no focal symptoms, no pain on palpation of the trigeminal points, and no meningeal symptoms. Considering the bilateral and 'band-like' nature of the headache, it is unlikely that it is caused by a growing intracranial neoplasm or chronic subdural hematoma.

Therefore, the most likely mechanism underlying the patient's headaches is dilation of the intracerebral arterioles.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
