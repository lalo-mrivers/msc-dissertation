["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks for the most likely diagnosis given a 40-year-old male with muscle biopsy showing CD8+ lymphocyte infiltration in the endomysium. The patient presents with weakness too severe to climb stairs or brush his hair, but denies headaches and change in vision. Based on the symptoms and biopsy findings, we can start by ruling out other possible causes of muscle weakness. Systemic lupus erythematosus typically affects joints and skin, and is unlikely to cause such severe muscle weakness without any joint or skin involvement. Polymyalgia rheumatica is an inflammatory disorder that mainly affects the muscles of the neck, shoulders, and hips, but it usually presents with a more gradual onset of symptoms over several weeks. Dermatomyositis is an autoimmune disorder that typically affects the muscles of the face, arms, and legs, and often has skin involvement such as rash or Gottron's papules. Given these possibilities, we are left with polymyositis as the most likely diagnosis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
