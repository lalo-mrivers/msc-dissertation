["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the development of naive T cells (TH0) into specific subsets due to an infection. The symptoms presented by the patient are consistent with a diagnosis of pinworms (Enterobius vermicularis). The scotch tape test is a common method for diagnosing pinworms, and mebendazole is an effective treatment for this condition.\n\nNaive T cells (TH0) differentiate into specific subsets in response to the presence or absence of certain cytokines. In the case of an intestinal helminth infection like pinworms, TH2 cells are typically involved in the immune response.\n\nTherefore, it can be inferred that the na√Øve T cells (TH0) have developed into TH2 cells due to the infection.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
