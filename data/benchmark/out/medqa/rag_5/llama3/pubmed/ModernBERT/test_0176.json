["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks for the overall specificity of the PET radiotracer test. To calculate this, we need to divide the number of true negatives (patients without PD) by the sum of true negatives and false positives. From the given information, there are 20 true negatives (patients without PD who tested positive) and a total of 600 patients without PD. Therefore, the specificity is calculated as: true negatives / (true negatives + false positives) = 20 / (20 + 590).\",\n\"answer_choice\": D"]
