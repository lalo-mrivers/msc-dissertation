["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is somnolent but responsive when aroused. He has altered mental status, diminished deep tendon reflexes bilaterally, and an ataxic gait. His pupils are normal. Blood alcohol concentration is 0.04%. An ECG shows no abnormalities. The combination of altered mental status, decreased reflexes, and ataxic gait suggests a possible autonomic dysfunction or brain damage. Considering the patient's age and the presence of somnolence, I think it's unlikely to be due to ethanol intoxication or cannabis intoxication. Benzodiazepine intoxication can cause similar symptoms, but an ECG without abnormalities makes this less likely. Therefore, I'm focusing on other possible causes. The patient's symptoms are consistent with post-traumatic parkinsonism, which was described in the provided case report. Additionally, the normal pupils and blood pressure suggest that it is not a case of Shy-Drager syndrome.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
