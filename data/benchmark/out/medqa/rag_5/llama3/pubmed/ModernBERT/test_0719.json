["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the function of different enzymes in various human cell types. We are given a subset of normal human cells with an elevated intracellular concentration of bisphosphoglycerate mutase. This suggests that these cells have undergone some sort of differentiation or activation, which may affect their enzyme profile.\n\nLooking at the provided documents, we can see that bisphosphoglycerate mutase is not mentioned in any of them. However, one document does mention a growth assay using Hoechst 33258, which detects DNA content. This suggests that these cells are likely to be in an active growth phase.\n\nThe question is asking about the absence of enzymes in these cells. Given the elevated concentration of bisphosphoglycerate mutase and the fact that these cells are in an active growth phase, it's possible that some enzymes involved in DNA replication or cell cycle regulation may be absent.\n\nLooking at the answer choices, we can see that none of them are directly related to DNA replication or cell cycle regulation. However, one enzyme that is involved in regulating the cell cycle is pyruvate kinase.\n\nPyruvate kinase is an enzyme that plays a critical role in glycolysis and has been implicated in the regulation of the cell cycle. Given the active growth phase of these cells, it's possible that pyruvate kinase may be absent or have altered activity in these cells.\n\nTherefore, the most likely answer to this question is B: Pyruvate kinase.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
