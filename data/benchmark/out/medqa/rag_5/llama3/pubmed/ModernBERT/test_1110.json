["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has a history of pain at the back of his left ankle with tenderness above the left posterior calcaneus and a firm, 3-cm, skin-colored nodule that moves with the left Achilles tendon. A biopsy of the nodule was taken. The mother had a myocardial infarction at age 54, which suggests a possible familial risk for cardiovascular disease. The patient's BMI is normal. The combination of clinical features and family history points towards an underlying genetic disorder. The biopsy photomicrograph shows a neuromatoid pathology in the dermis, similar to what was seen in the previous case of medullary carcinoma of thyroid gland.
