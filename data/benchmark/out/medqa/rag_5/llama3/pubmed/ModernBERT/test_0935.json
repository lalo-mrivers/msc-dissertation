["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents do not mention the specific red cell indices or parameters mentioned in the question. However, we can refer to the document [Red cell indices in the aged. 1 726 patients over the age of 70 (author's transl)]. It states that red cell counts, hemoglobin and hematocrits are slightly lower than those in young adults. The quality of the red cells is normal, because the MCV (mean cell volume) and MCHC (mean cell hemoglobin concentration) are normal.\n\nThe question mentions an absolute increase in the cells shown in the first image. This could be referring to the fact that red cells normally constitute 25â€“40% of total leucocyte count. Therefore, the question is likely asking about the characteristics of these cells.\", \n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
