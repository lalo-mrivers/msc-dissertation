["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a previously healthy 79-year-old woman who underwent surgical repair of a hip fracture six days ago. She is experiencing agitation, confusion, and disorientation. Her husband mentions that she drinks one to two glasses of wine weekly, but her only current medication is oxycodone for pain. The patient's vital signs are within normal limits, and neurologic examination shows inattentiveness but no focal deficits. Urine dipstick is also normal.

Opioid intoxication is possible due to her oxycodone medication, but delirium seems more likely given the patient's sudden onset of confusion and disorientation.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
