["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is experiencing shortness of breath, substernal chest pain at rest, nonproductive cough, fever, and malaise. The physical examination shows distended neck veins, bilateral basilar rales, and muffled heart sounds on auscultation. The ECG shows sinus tachycardia, diffuse ST segment elevation, low voltage QRS complexes, and fluctuating R wave amplitude.\n\nFrom the documents provided, I can see that a similar presentation was seen in patients with Borrelia myocarditis (complete AV block) and cardiac tamponade (3 degrees A-V block). However, the ECG findings of sinus tachycardia, diffuse ST segment elevation, low voltage QRS complexes, and fluctuating R wave amplitude are more consistent with a diagnosis of cardiac tamponade.\n\nAdditionally, the presence of distended neck veins, bilateral basilar rales, and muffled heart sounds on physical examination also support this diagnosis. Therefore, I believe that the most likely diagnosis is Cardiac Tamponade (D).\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D\""]
