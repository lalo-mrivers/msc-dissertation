["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is an 18-month-old boy who has stopped walking and appears weaker than before. He also experiences brief convulsive episodes. The physical examination shows muscle rigidity, diffuse muscle wasting, absent reflexes, and metachromic granules in the urine sample. This suggests a muscular dystrophy. We can rule out other possibilities such as infections or neurological disorders based on the patient's age and the presence of muscle rigidity and wasting.\n\nThe only enzyme defect that can cause progressive muscular dystrophy is hexosaminidase A deficiency, which results in Tay-Sachs disease. However, this condition usually presents with seizures, loss of motor skills, and cognitive impairment, but no muscle rigidity or wasting.\n\nThe patient's muscle biopsy would show an increased serum CK level, which is typical of primary muscular dystrophy.\n\nThe patient's history suggests that he may have a primary muscular dystrophy, possibly Duchenne muscular dystrophy. The absence of reflexes, muscle rigidity, and diffuse muscle wasting are all consistent with this diagnosis.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D: Hexosaminidase A.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"]
