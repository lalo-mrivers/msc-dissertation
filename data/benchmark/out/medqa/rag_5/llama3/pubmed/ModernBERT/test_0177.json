The physical examination reveals non-tender nodules on the left 1st, 3rd, and 4th distal interphalangeal joints, tenderness at the base of both thumbs, and enlarged knees with pain and crepitus on passive range of motion.\n\nThe patient's history as a professional athlete who retired at age 50 is also important.
