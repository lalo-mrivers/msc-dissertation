["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the resistance to blood flow in a vessel with occlusion, we can use the formula R = (8L)/(πr^4), where R is the resistance, L is the length of the vessel, π is pi, and r is the radius. Given that the diameter has reduced by 50%, this means the radius has also reduced by 50%. Therefore, the new radius would be 0.5 times the original radius. Since we are looking for the increase in resistance relative to a vessel with no occlusion, we can assume the length and radius of the vessel remain constant. This allows us to focus on the effect of the diameter reduction on resistance.\n\nUsing the formula, if we substitute the new radius (0.5 times the original radius) into the equation, we get:\n\nR = (8L)/(π(0.5r)^4)\n\nSince r is the original radius, we can substitute 2 times the new radius (which would be the original radius) for 4 times the new radius to simplify the equation:\n\nR = (8L)/(π(2*0.5r)^4)\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\nR = (8L)/(π(1/8)r^4)\n\nNow, if we compare this equation to the original equation R = (8L)/(πr^4), we can see that the only difference is the exponent of r, which has changed from 4 to 4-3. Since the length and radius remain constant, the increase in resistance is equal to the reciprocal of the ratio of the exponents:\n\nR/R_no_occlusion = (4-3)/(4) = 1/4\n\nSo, the resistance increases by a factor of 1/4 or 0.25 relative to a vessel with no occlusion.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"D: 4\"\n}"]
