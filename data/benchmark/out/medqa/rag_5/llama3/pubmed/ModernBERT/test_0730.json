["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has an allergic history to cephalosporins, which rules out using a third-generation cephalosporin as a treatment option. The physical examination shows eyelid swelling and eye itching, which suggests that the child may have an allergy or an infection affecting her eyes.
