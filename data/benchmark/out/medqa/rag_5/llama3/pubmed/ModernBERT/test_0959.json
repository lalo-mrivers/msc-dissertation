["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the patient's symptoms of stiffness in his arm, difficulty combing his hair and reaching objects high on the shelf, and decreased passive and active range of motion with strength 4/5 in his upper extremity, I would think step-by-step as follows: The patient is experiencing shoulder dysfunction, which is not related to the level of paralysis or scoliosis mentioned in the documents about myelomeningocele. Hip and knee flexion contraction or high degree of scoliosis are not relevant factors in this case.
