["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 18-year-old army recruit with a 3-week history of right foot pain. Initially the pain occurred while running but now it's also present at rest. The location of the pain is diffusely over the right forefoot, which makes me think of a metatarsalgia or possibly Morton's neuroma. The patient has mild swelling and when pressing the metatarsal of the third toe results in pain. This suggests that the pain is related to the third intermetatarsal space. An x-ray shows slight loss of cortical density and callus formation at the third metatarsal shaft, which further supports the diagnosis of metatarsalgia or Morton's neuroma.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
