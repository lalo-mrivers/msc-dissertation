["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has a history of asthma and is currently using an albuterol inhaler as needed to manage his symptoms. His mother reports that he's had to increase the use of his inhaler to four times per week for the past month, and he's woken up three times during the night due to symptoms. This suggests that the patient's asthma is not well-controlled. The patient also has bilateral late expiratory wheezes on auscultation of his lungs.\n\nThe relevant documents discuss sodium cromoglycate (cromolyn) as a treatment for asthma, particularly in reducing the need for concomitant anti-asthma medications and hospitalizations. They also mention beclomethasone dipropionate as an effective treatment for bronchial asthma.\n\nConsidering the patient's symptoms and history of allergic rhinitis, adding a long-term control medication like cromolyn or beclomethasone dipropionate could help improve his asthma control and reduce the need for rescue medications like albuterol. This is in line with the recommendations from the relevant documents.\n\nThe other options do not seem to address the patient's symptoms and history, so adding fluticasone daily, salmeterol twice daily, or zileuton twice daily does not appear to be the most appropriate change to his current treatment regimen.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
