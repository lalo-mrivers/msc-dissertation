["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with vomiting bright red blood and black and tarry stools. She has splenomegaly and a positive fluid wave on physical examination.

Given her history of alcoholism, it's likely that she has portal hypertension. Octreotide is used to control variceal bleeding. Among the options, octreotide is not listed.
