["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is an 8-year-old girl with a history of sore throat that resolved without treatment. She now presents with hematuria, proteinuria, and pitting edema. The elevated antistreptolysin O titer suggests that the underlying mechanism is related to streptococcal infection. Based on this information, it's likely that the patient has post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis (PSGN). PSGN is an immune-mediated disease that occurs 1-4 weeks after a group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal infection, characterized by the formation of antigen-antibody complexes. These complexes deposit in the glomeruli, leading to inflammation and damage.\n\nThe symptoms described, including hematuria, proteinuria, and pitting edema, are consistent with PSGN. Therefore, it's most likely that the underlying mechanism involves the formation of antigen-antibody complexes.\", \n\"answer_choice\": C"]
