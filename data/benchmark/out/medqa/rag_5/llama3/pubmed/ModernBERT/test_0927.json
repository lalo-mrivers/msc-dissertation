["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with sudden severe pain in his right great toe, which is consistent with gouty arthritis. The presence of erythema, swelling, warmth, and tenderness of the metatarsophalangeal joint suggests an inflammatory response. The serum uric acid level of 12 mg/dL supports this diagnosis. The cloudy synovial fluid with a high leukocyte count (18,500/mm3) and predominantly segmented neutrophils is also consistent with gouty arthritis.\n\nGiven that the patient has a history of nephrolithiasis and hypertension treated with hydrochlorothiazide, it's possible that his kidney function may be impaired. Therefore, increasing renal excretion of urate (option D) might not be an effective strategy.\n\nArthrocentesis yields cloudy fluid, which suggests an inflammatory response. Polarized light microscopy of the synovial fluid is necessary to visualize monosodium urate crystals, but it's not provided in this scenario. However, based on the clinical presentation and laboratory findings, it seems likely that gouty arthritis is present.\n\nThe most appropriate long-term pharmacotherapy for gouty arthritis would be a medication that reduces serum uric acid levels or increases its excretion. Corticosteroids are not typically used as long-term therapy for gouty arthritis.\n\nConsidering the patient's history and clinical presentation, option C, inhibition of xanthine oxidase, is likely the most appropriate mechanism of action for long-term pharmacotherapy.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
