["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient had a temporal artery biopsy to evaluate headache and blurry vision. The test results show decreased concentrations of arginine in vascular endothelial cells. Since the patient has a history of hypertension treated with lisinopril, we need to look for any possible explanations related to hypertension or its treatment. Lisinopril is an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, which can affect the production of nitric oxide (NO). Nitric oxide synthase uses L-arginine as a substrate to produce NO. Therefore, it's likely that the decreased concentration of arginine in vascular endothelial cells is related to the ACE inhibition by lisinopril.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
