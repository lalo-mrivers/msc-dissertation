["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the stage during which a T cell undergoes positive selection to ensure the preservation of self-MHC-restricted T cells. According to the provided documents, the development of different lineages of T cells within the thymus is described in 'T-cell subset relationships in thymocyte development'. The passage mentions that pathways, subpopulations, and cellular dynamics are becoming clearer, but the exact nature of the events leading uncommitted cells to choose a particular lineage has not been determined. However, it does not provide information about positive selection. Therefore, we need to look for other relevant information in the provided documents.\n\nIn 'T-cell memory', we find that memory T cells have increased expression of adhesion and activation molecules on them, potent functional status, and specific pathways of recirculation. This passage does not mention anything about positive selection either.\n\nHowever, 'Cellular aspects of early T-cell development' provides information about the early stages of T-cell development in the adult murine thymus. Although it does not explicitly mention positive selection, we can infer that double-positive T cells (expressing both CD4 and CD8) are present during this stage based on previous knowledge.\n\nGiven these findings, we can conclude that a T cell undergoing positive selection is likely to be at the double-positive T cell stage.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
