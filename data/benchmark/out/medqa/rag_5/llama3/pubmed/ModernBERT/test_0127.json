["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the immune cells that lyse abnormal cells without the need for opsonization, priming, or prior activation. We know that monoclonal plasma cells are abnormal cells and the immune cells in question prevent their proliferation. The bone marrow biopsy shows 6% monoclonal plasma cells, which suggests that these cells are not being properly eliminated by the immune system. We also know that class I major histocompatibility molecules are downregulated in these monoclonal plasma cells. Based on this information, we can infer that the immune cells in question are those that target abnormal cells independently of MHC class I presentation. This is a characteristic feature of natural killer (NK) cells.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C: Natural killer cells\""]
