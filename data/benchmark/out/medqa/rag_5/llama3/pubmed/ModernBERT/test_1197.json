["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with symptoms of nausea, shortness of breath, lightheadedness, and pale skin. He has a history of smoking 1 pack of cigarettes daily for 20 years. Given the ECG finding, we can rule out Viral myocarditis (A) as it typically doesn't cause these symptoms. Acute pericarditis (B) is also unlikely due to the patient's history of smoking which is more commonly associated with cardiac conditions. The patient's history of type 2 diabetes mellitus and taking metformin and sitagliptin suggests a possible link to his current symptoms. Saddle pulmonary embolus (D) could be a possibility, but it would be unusual for the patient to present with nausea and shortness of breath as primary symptoms. Acute inferior myocardial infarction (C) is the most likely underlying cause given the ECG finding and the patient's history.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\""]
