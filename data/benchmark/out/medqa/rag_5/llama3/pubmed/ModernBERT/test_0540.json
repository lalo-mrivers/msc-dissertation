["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's mother mentions that the patient was diagnosed with major depressive disorder 3 years ago and was taking medication for it. The patient has a history of threatening to take his life on several occasions but didn't seem serious. This information suggests that the patient may have been taking an antidepressant medication. The ECG shows a QT interval of 450 milliseconds, which is abnormal. Considering the patient's history and the ECG findings, it is likely that the patient overdosed on an antidepressant medication.\n\nThe medications mentioned in the case studies provided are imipramine and L-DOPA. However, these medications are not typically used for treating major depressive disorder. Imipramine is a tricyclic antidepressant, but it is not commonly prescribed for major depressive disorder due to its potential side effects.\n\nVenlafaxine is an SSRI that can cause a prolonged QT interval, which matches the patient's ECG findings. It is also a common medication used in treating depression. Therefore, based on the information provided and considering the patient's history and the ECG findings, it is most likely that the patient overdosed on Venlafaxine.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
