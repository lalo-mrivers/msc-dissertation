["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is presenting with severe shortness of breath due to poorly controlled asthma. The medication being administered is a nebulized bronchodilator.

Therefore, we are looking for an option that describes a downstream effect related to cAMP.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C: Decreased phosphodiesterase activity\""]
