["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"This question is about a specific medical procedure and its necessity. After reviewing the provided documents, I can see that they are related to different topics such as midline cervical clefts, restructuring healthcare systems, automated teaching methods for patients, and patient behavior. None of these topics seem directly relevant to the question at hand. Therefore, I will rely on my general medical knowledge and consider the context of the question. Choledocholithiasis-induced cholangitis is a condition that requires endoscopic clearance of the common bile duct, which may lead to complications if not managed properly. Routine insertion of a nasobiliary drainage tube after such procedure would aim to prevent these complications.\n\nConsidering this medical scenario and my knowledge, I believe that the necessity of inserting a nasobiliary drainage tube depends on various factors such as patient-specific conditions, severity of cholangitis, and post-procedure management. There is no straightforward answer, making option C (maybe) the most suitable choice.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"]
