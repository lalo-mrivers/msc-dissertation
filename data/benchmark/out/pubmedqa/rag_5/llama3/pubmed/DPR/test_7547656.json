["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, none of them discuss epinephrine's effect on uterine blood flow in pregnant ewes. The [Glycogen levels of rat ova during cleavage] document discusses glycogen content in rat eggs, not epinephrine or uterine blood flow. The [Effect of a chronic alpha adrenergic receptor blockade on basal secretion of renin in essential hypertension] and [Bactericidal antibody response to Pseudomonas aeruginosa by adults with urinary tract infections] documents discuss the effects of alpha-adrenergic blockers and beta-adrenergic receptors, but do not address epinephrine's impact on uterine blood flow. Therefore, we cannot conclude that continuous intravenous infusion of low-concentration epinephrine impairs uterine blood flow in pregnant ewes.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
