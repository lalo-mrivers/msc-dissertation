["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"This question is about the relationship between arch form and sagittal molar relationship or Bolton tooth-size discrepancy. Since none of the provided documents mention arch form, sagittal molar relationship, or Bolton tooth-size discrepancy, we need to look for any information related to dentofacial orthopedics, dental occlusion, or dental morphology.
