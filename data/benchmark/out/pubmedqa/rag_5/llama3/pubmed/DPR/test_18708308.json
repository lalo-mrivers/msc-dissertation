["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"While there is no direct mention of surgeons or surgical practices in the provided documents, we can infer that familiarity with current evidence can lead to a change in practice. The 'Best Asthma Care' document discusses quality improvement and demonstrating the quality of care for specific conditions like asthma. This suggests that staying up-to-date with current evidence can influence healthcare delivery systems and ultimately lead to changes in practice. Similarly, the 'Rational Model' document emphasizes the importance of considering various factors when correlating environmental health risks with disease patterns.
