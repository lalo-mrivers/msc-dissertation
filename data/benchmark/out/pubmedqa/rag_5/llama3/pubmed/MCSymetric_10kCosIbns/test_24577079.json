["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks if strategy training reduces age-related deficits in working memory. We can look at the provided documents to find answers related to age differences in working memory and how they might be mediated by training. The first document mentions that older adults exhibited greater reductions in accuracy as processing requirements increased, suggesting a decreased ability to transform or abstract information while preserving earlier processing. The second document shows increased age differences on the storage task as demands for resources increased but no differences on processing tasks. It suggests a deficiency of storage resources in working memory for old adults. There is no direct mention of strategy training reducing age-related deficits in working memory. Therefore, we cannot choose option A or C.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
