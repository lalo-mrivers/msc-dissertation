["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents provide information on the cost-effectiveness of colonoscopic surveillance after polypectomy. The analysis suggests that the cost-effectiveness is sensitive to estimates of the cumulative remaining risk for death from cancer after polypectomy as well as to surveillance efficacy. For persons whose remaining risk for death from cancer may be low, such as those with a single small adenoma, recommendations for colonoscopic surveillance at fixed and regular intervals may be excessively costly. This implies that colonoscopy can be expensive. However, the documents also highlight the importance of colonoscopy in diagnosing and treating colonic disease, including the removal of polyps and detection of cancer.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
