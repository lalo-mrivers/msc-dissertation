["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about socioeconomic differences in mortality persisting after retirement. The relevant documents are the ones that discuss health changes during retirement, loneliness on mortality, educational attainment, and earnings-replacement rate of old-age benefits. From the 'Physical and mental health changes in retirement age' document, we know that retirement had no clear effect on physical health but better mental health for those who retired at an older age. This suggests that socioeconomic factors may still play a role after retirement. The 'Effect of loneliness on mortality after retirement' study found no statistically significant differences in mortality between groups based on marital status, which implies that socioeconomic factors do not have a strong impact. However, the 'Educational attainment, occupational history, and stratification: determinants of later-life economic outcomes' study suggests that education still has an effect on income among elderly individuals, which may translate to socioeconomic differences in mortality. Finally, the 'Earnings-replacement rate of old-age benefits, 1965-75, selected countries' study highlights the importance of considering the impact of retirement benefits on socioeconomic differences after retirement. Based on these findings, it appears that socioeconomic differences in mortality do persist after retirement.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
