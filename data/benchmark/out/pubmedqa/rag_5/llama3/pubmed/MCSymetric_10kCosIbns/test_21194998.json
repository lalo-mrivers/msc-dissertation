["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about whether minimal access major surgery hurts less in newborns. To answer this, we need to look at the relevant documents. The first document talks about general anesthesia in infants and mentions that 46% of operations were performed during the first week of life, mostly as an emergency. This suggests that newborns may be more sensitive to pain and discomfort. The second document discusses postoperative minimal oxygen consumption in newborns and mentions a postnatal increase in mVO2 in most full-term newborns without operation or with minor operation. This could indicate that newborns have different physiological responses to surgery than adults. Finally, the third document provides general information on surgical entities in newborn infants and emphasizes the importance of immediate management. Considering these points, it seems that minimal access major surgery may not necessarily hurt less in newborns.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
