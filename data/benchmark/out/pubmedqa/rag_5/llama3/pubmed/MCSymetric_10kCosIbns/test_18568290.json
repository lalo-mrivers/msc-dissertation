["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the provided documents, it is clear that endothelin (ET) levels increase during hemodialysis. This is observed in both [Influence of hemoultrafiltration and hemodialysis on endothelin] and [Endothelin and platelet activating factor. Possible indices for biocompatibility of hemodialysis]. The study suggests that the decrease in ET level is related to decreased extracellular volume via ultrafiltration, as seen in [Influence of hemoultrafiltration and hemodialysis on endothelin]. This implies a role for ET-1 in hemodynamic changes during hemodialysis.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
