["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking whether reducing spasticity directly translates into functional benefit. The documents provided give a review of options available for managing spasticity, including physical agents, drugs, and neurosurgical procedures.

In fact, some of the documents discuss the importance of preserving maximum possible function in mobility and activities of daily living, suggesting that spasticity reduction is not the only factor influencing functional outcome. Therefore, it seems unlikely that reducing spasticity would directly translate into functional benefit.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
