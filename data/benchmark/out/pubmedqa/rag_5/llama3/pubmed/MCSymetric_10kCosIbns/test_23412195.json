["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking whether displaced midshaft clavicular fractures should be treated surgically. Looking at the provided documents, we see that there are different approaches to treating distal clavicular fractures and acromioclavicular dislocations. For example, [Early and intermediate results of conservatively and surgically treated lateral clavicular fractures] suggests that conservative treatment may be sufficient for some cases without dislocation. However, [Fractures of the distal clavicle: a case for fixation] recommends open reduction and internal fixation for Neer type 2 fractures of the distal one-third of the clavicle. Meanwhile, [Simultaneous dislocation-fracture of both ends of the clavicle] treats simultaneous dislocation-fractures with operative reduction. Finally, [A classification of acute acromioclavicular dislocation: a clinical, radiological and anatomical study] suggests that early surgery may be beneficial for severe disruptions. Considering these different approaches, it seems that there is no clear consensus on whether displaced midshaft clavicular fractures should always be treated surgically.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
