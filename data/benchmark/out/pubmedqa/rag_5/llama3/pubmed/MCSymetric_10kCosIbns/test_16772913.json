["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking if there's a difference in deflation rates between 500 prefilled textured saline breast implants and 500 standard textured saline breast implants. None of the provided documents mention anything about prefilled or standard textured saline breast implants, nor do they discuss deflation rates. The closest document that comes to discussing deflation rates is 'One preventable cause of spontaneous deflation of inflatable mammary prostheses', which talks about fixing suture tabs on breast implants causing undue stresses and resulting in deflation. However, this document does not provide any information about prefilled or standard textured saline breast implants. Therefore, based on the provided documents, it is not possible to determine if there's a difference in deflation rates between the two types of breast implants.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
