["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about cardiac reoperations in octogenarians. The relevant documents describe the outcomes of cardiac surgery in patients over 75 years old, including valve replacements and coronary artery bypass grafting. One study found that 18% of patients had reoperation due to structural valve deterioration, with an operative mortality rate of 35.9%.
