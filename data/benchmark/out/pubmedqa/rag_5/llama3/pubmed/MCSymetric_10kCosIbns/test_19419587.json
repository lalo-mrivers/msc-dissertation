["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe various techniques for sternal fixation and closure. The first document describes a method of improved chest wall fixation for correction of pectus excavatum, which involves resection of abnormal costal cartilages, sternal osteotomy, and mobilization, followed by fixation of the sternum in the corrected position. The second document compares osseous healing with wire versus rigid fixation and suggests that rigid fixation results in earlier union with primary osseous healing, suggesting greater inherent stability. The third document describes a new method for stabilizing dehiscence or instability of median sternotomy incisions using stainless steel retention sutures. These documents collectively suggest that sternal plating can improve sternal stability.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A: yes\"\n}"]
