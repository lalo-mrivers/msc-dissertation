["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the comparison of noise levels between high flow nasal cannulae and bubble CPAP for preterm infants. Both high flow nasal cannulae and bubble CPAP are used to provide continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) to newborns with respiratory insufficiency. The relevant documents describe various methods of delivering CPAP through the nasal route, including the use of plastic cannulas, Hudson binasal cannula, and Benveniste pediatric jet device. However, there is no direct comparison or discussion of noise levels between high flow nasal cannulae and bubble CPAP in these documents. Therefore, it is not possible to determine which method is noisier based on the provided information.\", \"answer_choice\": B}"]
