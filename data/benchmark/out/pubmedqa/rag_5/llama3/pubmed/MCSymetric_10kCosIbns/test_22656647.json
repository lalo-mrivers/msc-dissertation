["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking if acceptance rates of a national preventive home visit programme for older people are socially imbalanced. This means we need to consider whether the programme's success rate varies based on social factors such as income, education, or location. After reviewing the documents, I did not find any information that directly answers this question.
