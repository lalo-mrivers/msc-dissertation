["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about predicting admission at triage. The provided documents do not directly address this specific question. However, the document 'Triage assessment tool' mentions that the Triage Assessment Tool is designed to augment the decision making skills of the triage nurse. This implies that nurses are indeed involved in the process of predicting admission at triage. Additionally, the document 'Algorithm-directed triage in an emergency department' discusses an algorithm-directed triage system used by screeners who may not have prior medical experience.
