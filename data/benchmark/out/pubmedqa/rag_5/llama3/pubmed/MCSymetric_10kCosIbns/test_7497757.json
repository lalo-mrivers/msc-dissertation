["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe postbypass hypothermia and its relationship to the energy balance of cardiopulmonary bypass. The effects of systemic intraoperative hypothermia on the acute-phase and endocrine response to cardiac surgery show that a more profound level of intraoperative hypothermia significantly reduced the plasma adrenaline response to CPB but not the other components of the ER or APR. There is no mention of euthyroid sick syndrome, which suggests that cardiopulmonary bypass temperature does not affect postoperative euthyroid sick syndrome.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
