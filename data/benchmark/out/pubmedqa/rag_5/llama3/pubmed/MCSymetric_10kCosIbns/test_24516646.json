["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The provided documents discuss various methods for determining IgE levels, including RIST (radioimmunosorbent test) and PRIST (paper-radioimmunosorbent test). It is noted that while RIST generally yields higher values than PRIST, there is a good correlation between the two methods. The importance of measuring low levels of IgE accurately is highlighted, with some tests failing to meet this criterion. For instance, Phadebas RIST method failed to measure accurately levels as low as 20-30 u IgE/ml. In contrast, Phadebas PRIST technique has been shown to be useful for routine diagnostic purposes. The documents also discuss the importance of standardization and quality control in IgE determination, particularly when dealing with extremely high values.\",\n\"answer_choice\": A"]
