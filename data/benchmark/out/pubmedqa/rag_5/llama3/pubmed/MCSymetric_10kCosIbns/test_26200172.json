["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe various studies on biofeedback training and its effects on psychophysiological responses. In 'Effect of antecedent muscle tension levels on motor behavior', elevated pre-competition muscle tension was found to disrupt hand steadiness and grip strength, highlighting the potential for biofeedback relaxation techniques to improve performance. 'Biofeedback heart rate training during exercise' demonstrates that biofeedback can lead to lower mean heart rates, systolic blood pressure, and rate-pressure product during exercise. Finally, 'The effect of psychological strategies upon cardiorespiratory and muscular activity during treadmill running' shows that biofeedback can reduce ventilatory efficiency and increase tidal volume. These findings collectively suggest that biofeedback training of psychophysiological responses can enhance athletes' sport performance.\",\n\"answer_choice\": A\n}"]
