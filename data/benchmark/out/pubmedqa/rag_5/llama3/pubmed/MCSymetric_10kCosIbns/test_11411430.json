["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking whether antral follicle assessment is a better predictor of IVF outcome compared to age and FSH. We can analyze the provided documents to find the relevant information. From 'Significance of basal follicle-stimulating hormone levels in women with one ovary in a program of in vitro fertilization', we know that higher basal FSH levels are associated with poorer IVF outcomes. However, this document does not provide information on antral follicle assessment as a predictor of IVF outcome. From 'Ultrasound monitoring of ovarian follicular growth during spontaneous cycles in Nigerian women', we learn about the normal range of maximum pre-ovulatory follicular diameter and the indices of ovulation. Again, there is no direct connection to antral follicle assessment as a predictor of IVF outcome. The other documents do not provide relevant information for this question either.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that the provided documents do not support or contradict the idea that antral follicle assessment is a better predictor than age and FSH. This leaves us with two possibilities: it could be true (A) or false (B). The third option C is also possible as we cannot determine this from the given information.\n\nBased on our step-by-step thinking, the answer is B.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
