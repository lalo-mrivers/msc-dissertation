["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents discuss the complications of peroperative sterilization of hydatid cysts of the liver. It is mentioned that intra-operative collapse occurred in one patient after injection of H202 into the cyst and immediate postoperative death occurred. Postoperative sclerosing cholangitis occurred in 4 patients who received scolicidal solution injections into the cyst. The complications are likely due to the caustic effect of the scolicidal solution having diffused from the cyst into the biliary tree. The efficacy of intracystic injection of a scolicidal solution in preventing dissemination of the parasite is still unproven, and it is recommended that this maneuver be rejected in the surgical treatment of hydatid disease of the liver. There is no mention of fear of anaphylactic shock discouraging surgeons from adopting percutaneous or laparoscopic techniques. The focus is on the complications of peroperative sterilization.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
