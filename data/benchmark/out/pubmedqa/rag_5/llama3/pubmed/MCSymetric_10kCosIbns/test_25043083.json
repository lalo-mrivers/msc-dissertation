["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the anatomy, function, and biomechanics of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL). They also discuss reconstructive techniques and potential complications. However, none of the provided documents explicitly mention the relationship between posterior tibial slopes and failures of ACL reconstruction. Therefore, based on the available information, it is not possible to definitively answer whether failures of ACL reconstruction are associated with steep posterior tibial slopes.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
