["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about factors determining the survival of nasopharyngeal carcinoma with lung metastasis alone. Since the documents provided are related to nasopharyngeal carcinoma and metastases, I will look for information that addresses this specific scenario. The documents suggest that poor prognostic factors include M1 (presence of distant metastasis), Nho (advanced Ho's N-stage), CN1 (cranial nerves palsy), BS (skull base involvement), and CN2 (cranial nerves palsy). Additionally, the document on 'Distant metastases in nasopharyngeal carcinoma' suggests that when metastases are diagnosed, the prognosis is gloomy with a median survival under four months and a fatality rate of 91% within a year. Therefore, I will focus on factors that can impact the survival of patients with lung metastasis alone.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
