["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks whether decisional algorithms can replace global introspection in individual causality assessment of spontaneously reported ADRs. None of the provided documents directly address this specific question. However, one document discusses causality assessment in epidemiology and highlights the importance of multiple categories (enumerative induction, eliminative induction, deduction, and analogy) for causal assessment. This suggests that decisional algorithms may not be sufficient to replace global introspection in individual causality assessment. Furthermore, another document emphasizes the complexity of judgmental criteria and the perception of structure, which implies that simple decisional algorithms may not capture the nuances involved in assessing individual causality. Overall, it seems unlikely that decisional algorithms can fully replace global introspection.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
