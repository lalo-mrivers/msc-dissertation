["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks whether instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) predict dementia at 1- and 2-year follow-up. We have to analyze the relevant documents to find the answer. The first document talks about IADL as a screening tool for cognitive impairment and dementia in elderly community dwellers. It mentions that four IADL items are correlated with cognitive impairment independent of age, sex, and education: telephone use, use of means of transportation, responsibility for medication intake, and handling finances. A score adding the number of IADL dependencies has a sensitivity of 0.62 and a specificity of 0.80 at the lowest cut-off point (score > 0) for the diagnosis of cognitive impairment. The same score at the same cut-off has a sensitivity of 0.94 and a specificity of 0.71 for the diagnosis of dementia.\n\nThe second document talks about assessment of activities of daily living in the elderly, including instrumental activities like cooking, transportation, shopping, and cleaning. It mentions that 22% of the population were dependent in instrumental activities, and 13% were dependent in both instrumental and personal activities. However, it does not specifically mention the relationship between IADL and dementia.\n\nThe third document talks about disabilities and impairment in activities of daily living as possible risk factors in dementia: prospective study in Basel 1986. It mentions that impairments of hearing, of mobility, of cutting toe-nails, and of general physical activity were the conditions which were most frequently named. However, it does not specifically mention IADL or its relationship with dementia.\n\nThe fourth document talks about assessing functional status among elderly patients: a comparison of questionnaire and service provider ratings. It mentions that both approaches to functional assessment were used in rating 92 elderly primary care patients in terms of their performance of 13 mobility and self-help activities. However, it does not specifically mention IADL or its relationship with dementia.\n\nThe fifth document talks about comprehensive activities of daily living (ADL) index for the elderly. It mentions that a comprehensive ADL index was developed to measure disability in the elderly with a variety of handicaps. However, it does not specifically mention IADL or its relationship with dementia.\n\nBased on the analysis of these documents, we can conclude that instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) are related to cognitive impairment and dementia, as mentioned in the first document. Therefore, the answer is:\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
