["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe experiments on different animal species and kidneys. In the first document, it is mentioned that larger animals have relatively smaller kidneys and survive longer than smaller animals. This suggests that all kidneys are equally susceptible to ischemic damage, but the whole animal response varies between species. The second and third documents discuss the effects of normo- and hypothermic ischemia on renal function and perfusion. They show that hypothermic ischemia can reduce the risk of acute renal insufficiency. The fourth document describes an experiment where a kidney was cooled to 22--23 degrees C by initial hypothermic perfusion over a 5-F catheter introduced into the renal artery via the carotid artery, and then left in the open abdominal wound without any further attempts of cooling. This suggests that homogenous cooling and flushing is important for good preservation of the kidney after ischemia. The documents do not provide direct evidence on whether a solitary kidney is more resistant to ischemia or not. However, they suggest that larger animals with smaller kidneys may have an advantage in terms of recovery time after renal damage.\",\n\"answer_choice\": A"]
