["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking whether c-Kit-dependent growth of uveal melanoma cells is a potential therapeutic target. We can see from the provided documents that c-Kit receptor tyrosine kinase is down-regulated in primary nodular and metastatic melanomas, which suggests that it may not be playing a significant role in the growth of these tumours. Additionally, loss of c-kit expression was observed in the majority of cell lines established from human melanoma samples. Furthermore, progression of human cutaneous melanoma is associated with loss of expression of c-kit proto-oncogene receptor. These findings suggest that c-Kit-dependent growth may not be a significant factor in the growth of uveal melanomas.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
