["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks whether laparoscopic reoperation for failed antireflux surgery is feasible. The provided documents describe various antireflux operations, including Nissen fundoplication and Belsey Mark IV, but there is no specific mention of laparoscopic reoperation. However, the document 'Minimally invasive antireflux procedures' mentions the possibility of a minimally invasive approach to reconstruct a defective antireflux mechanism, which could include laparoscopic reoperation. Therefore, it can be inferred that laparoscopic reoperation for failed antireflux surgery is feasible.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
