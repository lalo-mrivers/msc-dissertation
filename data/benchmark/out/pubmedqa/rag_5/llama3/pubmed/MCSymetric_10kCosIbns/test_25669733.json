["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking if distal ureteral diameter can predict reflux resolution after endoscopic injection. Since there are no documents discussing this specific topic, we need to consider the available information. The provided papers discuss various aspects of vesico-ureteral reflux and ureteral length, but none of them mention the relationship between distal ureteral diameter and reflux resolution. Therefore, based on the available evidence, it is not possible to determine whether distal ureteral diameter can predict reflux resolution after endoscopic injection.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
