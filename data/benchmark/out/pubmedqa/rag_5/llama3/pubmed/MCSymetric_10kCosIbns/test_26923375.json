["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe various methods for diagnosing esophageal varices, including duplex Doppler ultrasonography. In one case report, a patient was diagnosed with gastric varices using duplex Doppler sonography, which initially suggested a submucosal tumor of the stomach by barium studies and endoscopy.
