["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking if antibiotics decrease post-tonsillectomy morbidity. In the first document, [Bacteremia and tonsillectomy], a comparative study was conducted to examine the course of bacteremia during surgery and the postoperative behavior in patients undergoing tonsillectomy. The study found that the use of doxycycline or amoxycillin resulted in confirmation of the advantages of the drug used within the first week of treatment. This suggests that antibiotics may have a role in decreasing post-tonsillectomy morbidity.\n\nIn the second document, [The efficacy of perioperative antibiotic therapy], a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial was conducted to examine the effectiveness of perioperative antibiotic therapy on recovery following tonsillectomy in adults. The study found that those patients who received antibiotics fared consistently better in the immediate postoperative period compared with the placebo group. Specifically, patients who received antibiotics experienced significantly less mouth odor and were able to tolerate a regular diet sooner.\n\nThe third document, [Complications of tonsillectomy], highlights the potential complications of tonsillectomy, including even death. This emphasizes the importance of minimizing morbidity during this intervention.\n\nFinally, the fourth document, [Quinsy tonsillectomy], presents a series of 50 cases of peri-tonsillar abscesses treated by immediate tonsillectomy and evaluates its results. The study shows that immediate tonsillectomy has a low morbidity rate and no significantly greater complication rate than elective tonsillectomy.\n\nBased on this analysis, it appears that antibiotics may decrease post-tonsillectomy morbidity.\",\n\"answer_choice\": A"]
