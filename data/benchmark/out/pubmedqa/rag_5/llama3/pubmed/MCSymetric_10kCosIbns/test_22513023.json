["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents provided discuss various aspects of Indigenous Australian mortality rates, such as life expectancy at birth, age- and cause-specific death rates, infant mortality, and health issues. One study found that Australian Aborigines have lower life expectancies at birth compared to other Indigenous populations. Another study constructed a life table for an aboriginal Malaysian population, the Semelai, showing they had a life expectancy at birth of 54.0 years, which is lower than some Malaysian populations but higher than selected Asian populations. Infant mortality rates were found to be high among Aboriginal settlements in Queensland, with premature birth being a major cause of neonatal deaths. These studies suggest that Indigenous Australians may experience premature aging, as they have higher death rates and lower life expectancies compared to other populations.\",\n\"answer_choice\": A"]
