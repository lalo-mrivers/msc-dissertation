["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks if endothelial cell patterns of astrocytomas are indicative of grade. The relevant document that answers this question is 'Pathological studies of CT findings in supratentorial astrocytoma. Correlation between low-density lesions and changes in fine structure.' According to the study, abnormalities of capillary ultrastructure result in the accumulation of contrast medium, which can be seen on CT scans. This suggests that endothelial cell patterns are indicative of grade, as changes in these patterns can affect the appearance of the tumor on CT scans.\", \"answer_choice\": A}"]
