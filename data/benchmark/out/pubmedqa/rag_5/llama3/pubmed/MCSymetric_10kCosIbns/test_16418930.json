["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the difference in Landolt C and Snellen e acuity in strabismus amblyopia. The relevant documents describe meridional amblyopia (MA) as an amblyopia in one meridian, orthogonally to which the visual acuity is normal. This applies to astigmatics. Amblyopic subjects with deep strabismic amblyopia exhibit considerable distortion in the amblyopic eye. The dominant eye shows distortions similar to those seen in normal observers. Mild strabismic amblyopes do not exhibit any significant spatial distortions. The Hirschberg test is used to measure the corneal reflex. No direct information is provided about Landolt C and Snellen e acuity in strabismus amblyopia. However, the concept of amblyopia as an abnormal visual development can be applied to this question.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
