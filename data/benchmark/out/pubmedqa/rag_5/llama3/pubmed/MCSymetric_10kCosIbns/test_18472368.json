["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents provide information on radiotherapy treatment for prostate cancer. The Long-term curative results of radiotherapy of patients with inoperable prostatic carcinoma article mentions that the treatment duration was not found to be significant, and untoward effects are the exception and may be minimized by fractionation. This suggests that treatment duration does not affect outcome after radiotherapy for prostate cancer. The Prostate cancer treated by radiotherapy: a multivariate study article also states that other factors such as tumor dose, age and delay between diagnosis and radiotherapy were not found to be significant. Therefore, it is unlikely that treatment duration would have an impact on the outcome.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
