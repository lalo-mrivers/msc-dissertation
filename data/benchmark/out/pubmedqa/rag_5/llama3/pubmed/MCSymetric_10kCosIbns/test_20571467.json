["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents mention the influence of donor age on graft survival. The first document states that kidneys from donors aged less than 15 years had a cumulative graft survival of 51%, which is higher than those from older donors. However, this difference is not statistically significant. Additionally, it suggests that pediatric-aged kidneys may be superior in pediatric recipients or older normotensive adult recipients. There is no mention of using elderly donors in young recipients. The second document discusses the use of kidneys from living related donors who were 60 years old and older, but does not specify the age range of the recipients. The third document reports on the transplantation of kidneys from pediatric cadaver donors to adult recipients, showing similar graft survival rates compared to kidneys from adult donors. Finally, the fourth document discusses complications and long-term renal function in living related kidney donors, but does not specifically address the question of using elderly donors in young recipients.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B: no\""]
