["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about whether case-mix based reimbursement stimulates the development of process-oriented care delivery. We can start by looking at what process-oriented care delivery means. It seems to be related to the idea of providing quality-based cost-effective care, as mentioned in 'Balancing quality of care and cost-effectiveness through case management'. This approach emphasizes communication and coordination between healthcare providers. Case-mix based reimbursement is a method where healthcare providers are reimbursed based on the type of patients they treat (case mix) rather than the services provided. It seems to encourage efficiency and cost-effective care. The papers 'Developing reimbursable clinical pharmacy programs: a goal-oriented approach' and 'Alternative physician payment methods: incentives, efficiency, and National Health Insurance' also highlight the importance of reimbursement in shaping healthcare provider behavior. Therefore, it is likely that case-mix based reimbursement stimulates the development of process-oriented care delivery.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
