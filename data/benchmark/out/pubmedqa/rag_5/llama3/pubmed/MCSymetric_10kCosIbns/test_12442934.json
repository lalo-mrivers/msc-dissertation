["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about perioperative blood loss during hip arthroplasty. The relevant documents are studies on ibuprofen's effects on hemodynamic instability after cemented arthroplasty in dogs and its analgesic activity in various clinical settings. The dog study suggests that ibuprofen does not prevent acute hemodynamic changes, including decreased arterial blood pressure, pulmonary hypertension, and decreased cardiac output. This implies that ibuprofen may not increase perioperative blood loss during hip arthroplasty. The other studies focus on the analgesic activity of ibuprofen and do not provide information about perioperative blood loss.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
