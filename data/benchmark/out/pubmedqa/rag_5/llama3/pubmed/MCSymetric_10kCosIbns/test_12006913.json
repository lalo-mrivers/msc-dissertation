["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to [Differences and similarities in ischemic heart disease in men and women], the clinical significance of selected coronary risk factors, including the role of oral contraceptive agents, nicotine, arterial hypertension, and professional work were discussed. In [Risk factors for myocardial infarction in young women], it was found that heavy cigarette smoking, reported treatment for pre-eclamptic toxaemia, and type II hyperlipoproteinaemia were independent risk factors for myocardial infarction. Additionally, [Epidemiology and risk factors for cardiovascular diseases in women] reports that some data from American studies showed an independent role of diabetes and obesity as risk factors.\n\n[Cardiovascular disease in women: an update] highlights the risk factors for CHD in women, which include smoking, hypertension, plasma lipoprotein concentrations, obesity, diabetes, and family history. [Relation between coronary risk and coronary mortality in women of the Renfrew and Paisley survey: comparison with men] shows that while there was a slightly greater relative risk of cholesterol for coronary death in women than in men, absolute and attributable risks were lower.\n\nBased on these studies, it appears that some risk factors may confer different risks between men and women. For example, the study suggests that smoking may have a lesser impact on women's CHD mortality compared to men. Additionally, obesity was found to be more prevalent in women but did not appear to have a direct correlation with CHD mortality.\n\nTherefore, it is unlikely that all risk factors confer equal risk of myocardial infarction in women as in men.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
