["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The provided documents discuss various techniques for mitral valve repair and replacement. Carpentier's ring is mentioned as a method for selective annulus reconstruction and atrioventricular annuloplasty. The technique involves inserting the ring in the mitral position, preserving the subvalvular mitral apparatus when possible. The documents also highlight the importance of preserving the patient's own mitral valve mechanism whenever possible. Minimally invasive surgery is not explicitly discussed, but the use of Carpentier's ring and artificial chords for repair suggests that minimally invasive techniques may be feasible.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
