["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The provided documents describe various methods for measuring skin temperature, including elevation changes in finger temperature as an index of postmenopausal hot flashes, ambulatory monitoring, wireless telemetry, and a device to measure cutaneous temperature sensitivity. These studies demonstrate the ability to measure skin temperature accurately and reliably using different techniques. However, none of these studies specifically investigate sternal skin conductance or suggest it as a reasonable surrogate for hot flash measurement. Therefore, based on the available information, I conclude that\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
