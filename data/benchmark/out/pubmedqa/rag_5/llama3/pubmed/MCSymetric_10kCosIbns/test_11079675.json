["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about pulmonary valve replacement in adults late after repair of tetralogy of Fallot. There are no specific mentions of pulmonary valve replacement in the provided documents for patients with tetralogy of Fallot. However, preservation of the native pulmonary valve during intracardiac repair of tetralogy of Fallot was attempted in some patients. The document 'Preservation of the pulmonary valve during intracardiac repair of tetralogy of Fallot' mentions that 54 patients had preserved pulmonary valves without using a transannular right ventricular outflow patch (TAP). Additionally, it is mentioned that pulmonary valve regurgitation of greater than mild degree occurred in 8 of 54 patients with the valve preserved. This information suggests that some adults may require pulmonary valve replacement late after repair of tetralogy of Fallot.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
