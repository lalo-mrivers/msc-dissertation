["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking whether CT scans of the abdomen are always necessary for patients with blunt trauma who have been intoxicated. The relevant documents discuss the value of CT scans in evaluating abdominal trauma, including its accuracy and sensitivity. However, they do not specifically address the issue of intoxication.
