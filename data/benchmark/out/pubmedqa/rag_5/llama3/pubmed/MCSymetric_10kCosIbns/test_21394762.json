Defecatory disorders are often associated with abnormalities such as rectocele, increased anal pressure on straining, perineal descent, and external rectal prolapse. Pelvic pain is also described in the context of chronic pelvic pain, which can be caused by various factors including gynecological causes, endometriosis, adhesions, and psychosocial distress.
