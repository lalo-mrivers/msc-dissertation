["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the treatment of contralateral hydrocele in neonatal testicular torsion. We can analyze the given documents to find relevant information. From [Management of neonatal testicular torsion], we see that the distinction between prenatal and postnatal subgroups is emphasized, but there's no specific mention of contralateral hydrocele. In [Preventive orchidopexy of the contralateral testis after testicular torsion in childhood?], we find information about orchiectomy, which affects the contralateral testis, as shown in [Favorable effect of orchiectomy in unilateral testicular torsion on the exocrine function of the contralateral testis in rats]. However, this doesn't directly relate to hydrocele formation. The only document mentioning hydrocele is [Hydrocele formation after sandwich irradiation therapy for testicular tumor], which describes benign hydroceles occurring after treatment and requires high inguinal exploration for differentiation from a second testicular neoplasm. Given the lack of information about contralateral hydrocele in neonatal testicular torsion, we can't conclude that less is more.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
