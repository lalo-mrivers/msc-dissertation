["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about whether technical factors affect the prognosis of hepatic arterial embolization for unresectable hepatocellular carcinomas. The relevant documents are a combination of three studies on patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma treated by transcatheter arterial embolization (TAE). In one study, tumor extension and type were found to be important prognostic factors. Another study showed that encapsulation, gross appearance of the tumor, clinical stage, and therapy were significant factors in determining prognosis. The third study evaluated the therapeutic value of hepatectomy and TAE for hepatocellular carcinoma. None of these studies specifically addressed technical factors affecting prognosis.\n\nThe only study that may be relevant to this question is [The assessment of preoperative transcatheter arterial embolization (TAE) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)--the comparison between \"whole-liver\" TAE and \"lobar or segmental\" TAE]. This study found that the 2- and 6-year survivals in patients who received lobar or segmental TAE were significantly better than those in patients who did not receive preoperative TAE.\n\nTherefore, based on this one study, it can be concluded that technical factors (in this case, the extent of the liver treated by TAE) may affect prognosis. However, more studies are needed to confirm this finding and establish a clear relationship between technical factors and prognosis.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
