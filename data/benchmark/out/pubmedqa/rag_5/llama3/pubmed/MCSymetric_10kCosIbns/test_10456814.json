["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"We are looking for information on whether desflurane alters left ventricular function when used to control surgical stimulation during aortic surgery. We need to look at the studies that involve desflurane and left ventricular function. In 'Cardiovascular actions of desflurane with and without nitrous oxide during spontaneous ventilation in humans', we see that left ventricular ejection fraction increased at 0.83 MAC desflurane in oxygen, and otherwise did not differ from the conscious value. This suggests that desflurane may have a positive effect on left ventricular function. In 'Cardiovascular actions of desflurane in normocarbic volunteers', we see that left ventricular ejection fraction did not change except for a small increase at 1.66 MAC desflurane, and systolic wall stress was less at all concentrations of desflurane than during the conscious state. This suggests that desflurane may have a positive effect on left ventricular function. However, we also see that cardiac index did not change at any concentration of desflurane. Therefore, it seems that desflurane may have some effect on left ventricular function, but it is not significant enough to affect overall cardiac performance.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
