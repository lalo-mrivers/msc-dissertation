["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents provided are related to quality of life assessments for various patient populations. The CAST study used a 21-item scale to assess aspects of quality of life in patients after an acute myocardial infarction (MI). Similarly, the asthma questionnaire used a self-administered 20-item scale with Likert responses.
