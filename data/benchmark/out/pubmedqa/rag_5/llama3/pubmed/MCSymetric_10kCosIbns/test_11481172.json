["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The study 'The course of affective disorders. II. Typology of bipolar manic-depressive illness.' shows that female patients with bipolar disorder tend to have more depressive episodes than manic episodes. This suggests that the distinction between manic and mixed episodes may not be as clear-cut for female patients over time. Additionally, the study 'Incidence and signficiance of mixed affective states in a bipolar population.' finds that mixed states are present in 31% of outpatients with manic-depressive illness, suggesting that these mixed states can persist or recur over time. Finally, the study 'Season and manic relapse.' shows that there is no particular season for mania to occur, suggesting that the timing of episodes may not be predictable. Overall, this suggests that the distinction between manic/mixed episodes may not run true over time.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
