["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks whether the Barthel index alone is an adequate measure of outcome. The Barthel Index was used for ADL evaluation in some of the studies provided. Studies have shown that factors affecting long-term survival and disability are different from those affecting outcome immediately after stroke. Factors predicting mortality were, in order of importance, old age, a history of ischaemic heart disease, low mental-test score, low serum cholesterol concentration, low Glasgow Coma Score on admission, and the presence of left ventricular hypertrophy. Factors predicting poor functional outcome (Barthel Index 15) were a low Barthel Index at 3 months, old age, low mental-test score at 3 months and a low Glasgow Coma Score on admission. These findings suggest that the Barthel index alone may not be an adequate measure of outcome, as other factors also play a role.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
