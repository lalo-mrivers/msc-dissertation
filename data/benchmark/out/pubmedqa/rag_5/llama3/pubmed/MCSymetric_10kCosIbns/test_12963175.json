["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks if progression of valvar aortic stenosis can be predicted accurately. From the provided documents, we see that in one study, patients with increasing peak systolic gradient (PSG) had an average rate of increase of 1.3 mm.Hg/month, and in another study, serial echocardiographic studies documented significant progression of left ventricular outflow tract gradient in 25 patients (66%). However, we also see that other symptoms were not helpful in predicting an increase in severity. Therefore, while some progress can be predicted through hemodynamic evaluations, it seems that accurate prediction of progression may not be possible.\",\n\"answer_choice\": A\n}"]
