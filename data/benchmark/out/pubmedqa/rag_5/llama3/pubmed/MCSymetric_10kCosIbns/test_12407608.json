["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe standardized techniques for ultrasound controlled placement of a central venous catheter. One document compares the conventional method with the ultrasound-aided technique, showing that the latter reduces the number of punctures and cannulation time. Another document describes a simple method for percutaneous cannulation of the internal jugular vein without mentioning ultrasound imaging. The third document provides a new approach to internal jugular vein catheterisation but does not mention ultrasound imaging either. Therefore, it can be concluded that ultrasound imaging before puncture facilitates internal jugular vein cannulation.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
