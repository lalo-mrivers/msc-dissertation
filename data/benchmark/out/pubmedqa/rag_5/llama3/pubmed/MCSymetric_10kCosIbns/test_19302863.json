["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe various uses of cyanoacrylate, including nonsuture colonic anastomosis, osteosynthesis with an adhesive, using cyanoacrylate to facilitate rubber dam isolation of teeth, and closure of wounds in the oral mucosa. However, one study found that isobutylcyanoacrylate caused a delayed and disturbed healing reaction compared to sutures when closing intraoral wounds. This suggests that cyanoacrylate may not be suitable for all applications, including intestinal anastomosis. Additionally, another study mentioned the importance of strict observance of instructions and application of small amounts to avoid complications. Based on these findings, it is unclear whether the use of cyanoacrylate in intestinal anastomosis is a good and reliable alternative.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
