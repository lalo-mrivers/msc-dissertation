["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The provided documents describe various aspects of venous access devices, including implantable infusion port placement, central venous cannulation, and nursing care. None of the documents explicitly discuss prophylactic antibiotics for totally implantable venous access device placement by interventional radiologists. However, they do report on complications and outcomes related to these procedures. The Radiology-assisted placement of implantable subcutaneous infusion ports article mentions minor and major late complications, including catheter-related infections, but does not specifically discuss prophylactic antibiotics.
