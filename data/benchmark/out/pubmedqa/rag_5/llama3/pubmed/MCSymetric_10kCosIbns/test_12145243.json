["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents discuss the relationship between fasting blood glucose levels and the prevalence of new cases of diabetes. Data from epidemiologic surveys demonstrate that lower fasting plasma glucose levels at diagnosis are associated with improved outcomes. For instance, a study found that 41% of patients showed further deterioration of carbohydrate control over the first 13 years of the study when the fasting blood sugar was less than 110 mg/dl in the initial diagnostic test, compared to 82% when the fasting blood glucose was greater than or equal to 110 mg/dl. Additionally, a study comparing predictive power for overall blood glucose control found that 'good' fasting blood glucose concentrations were associated with 'good' blood glucose values throughout the day.\", \"answer_choice\": A}"]
