["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe various medical devices and techniques for measuring the size of the pupil, such as pupillometers and videopupillographs. However, none of these methods specifically mention using cobalt blue light slit-lamp biomicroscopy to measure mesopic pupil size. The closest technique mentioned is the use of infra-red diodes in a pupillometer to make measurements in darkness, but this is not directly related to cobalt blue light or slit-lamp biomicroscopy. Therefore, it can be concluded that mesopic pupil size cannot be measured with the cobalt blue light slit-lamp biomicroscopy method.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
