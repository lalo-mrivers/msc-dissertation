["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about predicting fears of recurrence in head and neck cancer survivors. The provided documents discuss quality of life, surgical treatment, infections, immunobiologic aspects, and treatment outcome in recurrent head and neck cancer. None of these topics directly address fears of recurrence. However, the document on Quality of Life mentions 'psychological symptoms' as one of the domains studied, which might be related to anxiety or fear of recurrence. The document on Treatment Outcome also discusses retreatment of recurrent lesions, but does not explicitly mention fears of recurrence. Therefore, it seems that there is no clear evidence in the provided documents to predict which head and neck cancer survivors develop fears of recurrence.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
