["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks whether chest wall irradiation should be included after mastectomy and negative node breast cancer. To answer this, we can look at the relevant documents. The first document states that patients with negative axillary nodes received irradiation to the peripheral lymphatics alone, which did not result in any chest wall recurrences. The second document also suggests that postoperative irradiation to the operation area seems to prevent chest wall recurrences even in stage I mammary carcinoma. Additionally, the third and fourth documents highlight the importance of including chest wall irradiation, especially in patients with positive axillary nodes or large primary breast lesions. Therefore, based on these findings, we can conclude that chest wall irradiation should be included after mastectomy and negative node breast cancer.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
