["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the patterns of recurrence of illness after recovery from an episode of major depression. One study found that the probability of remaining well after recovery from the index episode was 76% at 6 months, 63% at 1 year, and 25% at 5 years. Another study identified youth, presence of minor depression, and number of symptoms recalled as demographic and clinical risk factors for recurrence. Additionally, a study on spontaneous remission found no significant test-retest differences for length of time elapsed since the first questionnaire. A study on cognitive behavior therapy found that patients who were married or had fully recovered from their initial episode were less likely to relapse. These findings suggest that the type of remission after an episode of major depression may be an important risk factor to relapses.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
