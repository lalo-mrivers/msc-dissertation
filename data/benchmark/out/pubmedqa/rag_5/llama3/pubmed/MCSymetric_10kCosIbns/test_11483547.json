["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents discuss rattlesnake bites and their management. One of the documents talks about a patient who showed massive swelling and ecchymoses after envenomation by the timber rattlesnake, which was later diagnosed as DIC-like syndrome. Another document describes the effects of rattlesnake venom on rats, including perfusion failure, lactacidemia, hemoconcentration, hypoproteinemia, and death. A third document discusses the pathogenesis of hemorrhage induced by three purified toxins from rattlesnake venom. The management of snake bites once the patient reaches the hospital includes obtaining necessary blood parameters, evaluating fang marks and neurovascular status, monitoring systemic signs and symptoms, and starting intravenous antivenom. Concomitantly, measuring intracompartmental and subcutaneous tissue pressure in all clinically suspected areas is important. If intracompartment pressures are greater than 30 mm Hg, immediate surgical decompression is advisable.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
