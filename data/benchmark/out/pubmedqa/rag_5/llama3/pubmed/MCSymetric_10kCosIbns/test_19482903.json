The development of equipment by RCA describes standard items for use with children with spina bifida. Spina bifida children's scores on the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children show differential intellectual prognosis according to type of lesion, presence of hydrocephalus, degree of physical disability, and sex. An exploratory study found impairment in dotting speed in the spina bifida group, but both groups improved with practice. The study also noted that visual monitoring of the task was restricted in the second experiment.\n\nA policy was actively followed in South Gloucestershire to place spina bifida children in ordinary schools wherever possible. This was achieved successfully in 14 cases out of a possible 24. The main contraindications to attendance at ordinary school were below average intelligence, special perceptual problems, the need for intensive physiotherapy, and problem incontinence-particularly infaecal continence.\n\nTreadmill testing is not mentioned in any of these documents, which suggests that the question may be based on additional information not provided. Therefore, it would be difficult to determine if peak oxygen uptake reflects maximum oxygen uptake without more context.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
