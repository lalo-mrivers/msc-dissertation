["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe T-cell dominated inflammatory reactions in the bronchi of asthmatics, which are not reflected in matched bronchoalveolar lavage specimens. This suggests that asthma is a complex condition with local and systemic inflammation. The clinical study on cough variant asthma highlights the importance of airway inflammation in this condition. The pharmacological modulation of asthma also emphasizes the role of inflammation in asthma. Histologically, asthma is characterized by inflammation, which contributes to airflow obstruction. Finally, the inflammatory response in asthma is recognized as a major pathologic feature. Based on these findings, it can be concluded that paucigranulocytic asthmatics are not truly non-inflammatory.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
