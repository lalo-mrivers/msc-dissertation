["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about an affinity column-mediated immunoassay method for blood tacrolimus assay. None of the provided documents discuss tacrolimus or an affinity column-mediated immunoassay method specifically. However, one document discusses a high-performance liquid chromatographic method for analyzing Oltipraz in serum and urine. Another document describes a Western blotting procedure using chemiluminescent substrate and alkaline phosphatase-labeled detection antibodies. No information is provided about microparticle enzyme immunoassay methods or affinity column-mediated immunoassays for tacrolimus. Therefore, it's not possible to determine the suitability of this method as an alternative.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
