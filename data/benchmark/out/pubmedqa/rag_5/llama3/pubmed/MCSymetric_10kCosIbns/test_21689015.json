["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about whether dogs can prime autistic children for therapy. The provided documents do not directly address this topic. However, the document 'Setting generality and stimulus control in autistic children' discusses the importance of setting generality and stimulus control in treating autistic children. While it does not mention dogs specifically, it suggests that identifying functional stimuli and introducing them into new settings can improve treatment outcomes. The document 'Generalization by autistic-type children of verbal responses across settings' also highlights the importance of generalization across settings for effective therapy. Considering these findings, it is possible to imagine a scenario where dogs could be used as a stimulus to prime autistic children for therapy, but there is no direct evidence to support this idea.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
