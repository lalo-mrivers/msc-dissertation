["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the lifetime prevalence of impetigo, molluscum, and herpes infection in children with atopic dermatitis. After reviewing the documents, I found that the microbial flora of atopic dermatitis shows a high carriage rate of Staphylococcus aureus (79% for anterior nares, 76% for uninvolved skin, and 93% for lesions). Additionally, the counts of S aureus were higher in lesions compared to adjacent normal skin. This suggests that there is an increased risk of secondary bacterial infections in children with atopic dermatitis. Therefore, it can be inferred that lifetime prevalence of impetigo (a common complication of atopic dermatitis) may be increased.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
