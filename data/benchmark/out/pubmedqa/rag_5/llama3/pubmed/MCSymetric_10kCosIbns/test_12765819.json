["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about spinal subdural hematoma as a sequela of a ruptured intracranial aneurysm. We can look at the provided documents to see if they mention anything related to this topic. In 'Subdural hematomas due to ruptured cerebral aneurysms: angiographic diagnosis and potential pitfall for CT', we find that subdural hematoma can occur secondary to rupture of intracranial aneurysms, but it's not specific to spinal region. In 'Comparative study of intracranial aneurysms in advanced age', we don't find any information about spinal subdural hematoma. In 'Treatment of intracranial hemorrhage', there is no mention of spinal subdural hematoma as a sequela of ruptured intracranial aneurysm. However, in 'Subdural haematoma (effusion) and internal hydrocephalus', we can find information about subdural hematoma secondary to rupture of intracranial aneurysms, but again it's not specific to spinal region. We don't have any direct evidence linking spinal subdural hematoma to ruptured intracranial aneurysm in the provided documents.\",\n\"answer_choice\": A"]
