["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The provided documents discuss various aspects of microalbuminuria and its relationship with preeclampsia. One document mentions that there was no significant difference in the values of UA and UA/UC in the preeclamptic group when compared with the control group at the same stage of gestation, which suggests that microalbuminuria cannot be used as a predictor of preeclampsia. Another document highlights the usefulness of the urinary microalbumin/creatinine ratio in predicting pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH), not preeclampsia specifically.
