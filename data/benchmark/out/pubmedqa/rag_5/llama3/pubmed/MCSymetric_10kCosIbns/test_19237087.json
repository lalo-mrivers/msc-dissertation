["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking whether many colorectal cancers are due to missed adenomas. The relevant documents suggest that there are roughly two types of colorectal cancers: one that arises de novo and another that follows an adenoma-carcinoma sequence. Exophytic cancers, which account for approximately 60% of all colorectal cancer cases, often have adenomatous remnants within them, suggesting that these cancers may arise from the adenoma-carcinoma sequence. However, infiltrating and ulcero-infiltrating tumors, which represent around 40% of all resected colorectal cancers, rarely display adenomatous tissue, suggesting that they may arise de novo. Therefore, it can be concluded that some colorectal cancers are due to missed adenomas, but not many.\", \"answer_choice\": A}"]
