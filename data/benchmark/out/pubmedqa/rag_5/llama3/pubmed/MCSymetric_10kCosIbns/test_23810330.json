["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about intraoperative neuromonitoring and its association with better functional outcome in patients undergoing open TME. The relevant document provided is 'Intraoperative facial nerve monitoring: prognostic aspects during acoustic tumor removal.' This document highlights the importance of intraoperative facial nerve monitoring with electrical stimulation (IFNMES) in predicting immediate postoperative facial nerve function. It suggests that patients who exhibit less than 500 microvolts of ongoing EMG activity during surgery and yield at least a 500-microvolt contraction when stimulated with 0.05 milliamps at the brainstem after tumor removal can expect an excellent immediate facial nerve result. This information does not directly address the question about open TME, but it provides insight into the effectiveness of intraoperative neuromonitoring in predicting postoperative outcomes.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
