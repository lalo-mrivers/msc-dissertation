["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the prognosis of low-tone sudden deafness. According to the document '[Progressing cases from low tone sudden deafness to Menière's disease--cochlear impairment in the so-called pre-Menière's disease period]', 6 out of 80 patients with low-tone sudden deafness progressed to Menière's disease, which means not all patients with low-tone sudden deafness will inevitably progress to Meniere's disease. The document also states that there were no close relationships between subjective symptoms and audiological features in the pre-Menière's disease period (from the onset of LTSD to the recurrence of vertigo with cochlear symptoms), which further supports the idea that not all patients with low-tone sudden deafness will progress to Meniere's disease. Therefore, it can be concluded that the prognosis of low-tone sudden deafness is not necessarily a progression to Meniere's disease.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
