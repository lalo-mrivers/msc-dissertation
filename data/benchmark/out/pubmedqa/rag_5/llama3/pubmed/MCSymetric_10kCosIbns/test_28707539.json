["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The study on Quantification of adipose tissue by MRI shows that visceral AT represented 18.3% of the total AT volume. The study on Longitudinal studies on adipose tissue and its distribution in human subjects mentions that approximately two-thirds of total adiposity was on the surface, while one-third was in the interior. There is no direct information provided about the relationship between visceral AT area measurement at a single level and visceral AT volume. However, it can be inferred that measuring visceral AT area at a single level may not accurately represent visceral AT volume.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
