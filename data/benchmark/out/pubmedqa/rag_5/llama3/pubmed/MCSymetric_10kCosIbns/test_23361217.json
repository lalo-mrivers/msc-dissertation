["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe unicompartmental knee replacement with different types of tibial components. The article 'Soft-tissue balance and alignment in medial unicompartmental knee arthroplasty' compares the Oxford meniscal-bearing implant to a fixed-bearing implant, showing that the former resulted in better mechanical alignment. Another document, 'Arthroplasty of the knee', describes an Oxford-style prosthesis with a tibial component, but doesn't specifically compare different types. The paper 'Kinematics of the knee after prosthetic replacements' describes the motion of knees with different types of prostheses, including fixed hinge and condylar replacement prostheses. Based on this information, it seems that the type of tibial component can affect mechanical alignment.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
