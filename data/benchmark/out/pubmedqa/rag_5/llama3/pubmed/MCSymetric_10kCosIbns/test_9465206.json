["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is whether magnetic resonance (MR) can substitute for diagnostic arthroscopy in detecting 'occult' posttraumatic lesions of the knee. Several studies have investigated the diagnostic accuracy of MR in evaluating meniscal and cruciate ligament injuries, as well as articular cartilage lesions. The results consistently show that MR has high sensitivity and specificity in diagnosing these types of lesions. Furthermore, MR has been shown to be effective in assessing the status of partially resected menisci and subchondral medullary lesions following knee surgery. Therefore, based on the available evidence, it can be concluded that MR is a reliable method for detecting 'occult' posttraumatic lesions of the knee, and may indeed substitute for diagnostic arthroscopy.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
