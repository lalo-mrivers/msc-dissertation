["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The study [Electromyography of the uterus in monitoring pregnancies with symptoms of premature labor] shows that myometrial electrical activity can be used to predict successful or unsuccessful tocolytic treatment. The same study also suggests that symptomatic preterm pregnancies have higher uterine muscle electrical activity compared to asymptomatic term pregnancies. Additionally, the study found that myometrial electrical activity can distinguish between uncomplicated and complicated pregnancies. In contrast, the other studies [Home monitoring of uterine contractility, Ultrasonic demonstration of myometrial contractions in intrauterine pregnancy, Uterine activity after preterm premature rupture of the membranes] do not provide direct evidence on whether myometrial electrical activity can identify patients in preterm labor. Therefore, based on the available literature, it is possible to conclude that myometrial electrical activity may be used as a predictor for patients in preterm labor.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
