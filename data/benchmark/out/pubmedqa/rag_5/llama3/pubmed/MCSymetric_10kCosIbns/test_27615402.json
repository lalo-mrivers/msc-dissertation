["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks whether the familial transmission of drinking patterns persists into young adulthood. Based on the provided documents, it can be seen that there is evidence of intergenerational transmission of alcohol problems and familial risk factors influencing the development of drinking behavior. The studies suggest that offspring of problem-drinking parents are more likely to develop substance use disorders themselves. For example, the study 'The environmental intergenerational transmission of alcohol problems: a comparison of two hypotheses' found support for the 'positive influence' hypothesis in women with fathers with drinking problems and the 'relationship deficiency' hypothesis in men with mothers with drinking problems. Similarly, the study 'Differences and similarities in development of drinking behavior between alcoholic offspring of alcoholics and alcoholic offspring of non-alcoholics' found that male alcoholics who had biological fathers who were also alcoholics (FHP) began tasting and regularly drinking alcohol at an earlier age than those without such a family history (FHN). These findings suggest that the familial transmission of drinking patterns does persist into young adulthood.\",\n\"answer_choice\": A"]
