["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The study [Quantitative coronary angiography: progression and regression of coronary stenoses--an intervention study with fenofibrate] shows the efficacy of fenofibrate on lipid and lipoprotein levels. This suggests that fenofibrate can have a beneficial effect on cardiovascular health, which is relevant to sleep apnoea syndrome. The studies [Multicenter study of the efficacy and tolerance of gemfibrozil and fenofibrate in the treatment of primary hyperlipoproteinemia] and [Lipoprotein particle analysis comparing simvastatin and fenofibrate] show that fenofibrate can have a positive effect on lipoprotein composition. There is no evidence from the provided studies to suggest that fenofibrate would not be effective in sleep apnoea syndrome.\",\n\"answer_choice\": A"]
