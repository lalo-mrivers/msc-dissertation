The documents also mention that it is impossible to demonstrate any increased risk of malformation with doses below 15 rads, and that the increase over the spontaneous incidence of malformation is slight at doses below 25 rads. Additionally, the documents state that a very small increase in the frequency of leukaemias and cancers has been observed after irradiation in utero for pelvimetry, which delivers a few rads; it can be estimated from these data that a dose of 2 rads induces at the most the risk of one case of cancer in 2,000 children.
