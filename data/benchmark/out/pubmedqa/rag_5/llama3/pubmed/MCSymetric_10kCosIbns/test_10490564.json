["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, exercise-induced hypotension has been considered a marker of extensive coronary artery disease (CAD) and poor prognosis. In one study, 96% of patients who developed hypotension during treadmill exercise testing had abnormal single-photon emission computed tomographic thallium images, suggesting ischemia involving the inferior/posterior segments. Another study found that early hypotensive response was almost always due to severe coronary artery disease. These findings suggest a possible link between hypotension and myocardial ischaemic events.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A: yes\"\n}"]
