["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about reporting cavitation in proximal surfaces in a cone beam computed tomography examination. None of the provided documents specifically discuss this topic or provide information on how to diagnose or report cavitation in this context. Therefore, I can only rely on general medical knowledge and guidelines for radiological examinations. Cone beam CT is typically used in dental radiology to evaluate various oral structures, including the proximal surfaces. Cavitation in these areas could be indicative of caries or other pathologies. As such, it would be reasonable to report cavitation in proximal surfaces in a cone beam CT examination.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
