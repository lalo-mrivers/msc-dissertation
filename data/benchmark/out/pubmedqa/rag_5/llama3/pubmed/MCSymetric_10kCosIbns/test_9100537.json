["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks if nonproliferative breast disease and proliferative breast disease without atypia can be distinguished by fine-needle aspiration cytology. In the document 'Cytologic differentiation between proliferative and nonproliferative breast disease in mammographically guided fine-needle aspirates', a cytologic grading system is proposed to further characterize benign breast lesions. The system assigns values ranging from 1 to 4 to each cytologic criterion, and a score based on the sum of the individual values was calculated for each case. Nonproliferative disease was diagnosed when the total score ranged from 6 to 10, while proliferative disease without atypia was diagnosed with a total score ranging from 11 to 14. This study suggests that it is possible to apply a cytologic grading system to further subclassify benign breast disease and distinguish these forms from neoplastic lesions.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
