["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks if surrogates of injury severity influence the occurrence of heterotopic ossification in fractures of the acetabulum. The provided documents describe different types of heterotopic ossification and their prevention or treatment. Heterotopic ossification is mentioned as a complication in acetabular fractures, with 23% of patients developing functionally significant heterotopic ossification when not receiving adequate prophylactic irradiation or indomethacin. The development of severe heterotopic ossification was also associated with increased time from injury to operation. These findings suggest that surrogates of injury severity, such as the time from injury to operation, may influence the occurrence of heterotopic ossification in fractures of the acetabulum.\", \"answer_choice\": A}"]
