["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking whether preoperative fasting is necessary for patients undergoing abdominal surgery. The provided documents describe the importance of normal nutritional status during the postoperative period to prevent complications and promote recovery. In the early postoperative period, membranous digestion disturbances and intestinal motility dysfunction are expected, making it unfavorable to prescribe a diet. However, the study on perioperative total parenteral nutrition shows that fasting can be used as a means to reduce catabolism by surgical trauma, especially after greater surgical operations. Therefore, considering the current practice of pre-operative fasting still largely unchanged and the recognition of vast potential complications of prolonged fasting, it seems that preoperative fasting may not be necessary for patients undergoing abdominal surgery.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B: no\"\n}"]
