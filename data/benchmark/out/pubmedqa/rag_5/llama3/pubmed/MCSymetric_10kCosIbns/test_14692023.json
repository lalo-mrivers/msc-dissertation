["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks if breast cancer survival is improving. We need to look for studies that show trends or improvements over time in breast cancer survival rates. In the study 'Survival in breast cancer: study of 283 patients', it does not explicitly state whether breast cancer survival is improving, but it mentions that there was a significant increase over time in the proportion of patients with localized disease, which would be expected to reduce the Quebec death rate from breast cancer in future if the better survival of these patients is not simply a function of earlier diagnosis. This suggests that survival might be improving.\n\nIn the study 'Is breast cancer ever cured? Follow-up study of 5623 breast cancer patients', it is stated that even for N- patients (which is currently considered as a localized disease cured by surgery in most cases), the 5, 10, 15 and 20 year death rates from breast cancer were 12%, 20%, 28% and 38%, respectively. This suggests that survival might not be improving.\n\nIn the study '[The long-term prognosis of breast cancer. Retrospective study of 973 patients]', it is mentioned that tumor stage was the most important prognostic factor, and that after 40 years of primary breast cancer therapy, 17% of stage I patients were still alive. This suggests that survival might not be improving.\n\nIn the study 'Curability of breast cancer. Long term follow-up suggests 30-40 per cent of \"early\" cases are \"cured\" by treatment', it is stated that the proportion cured is probably related to the biological characteristics of the tumour rather than to the primary treatment, and that careful staging is the best prognostic indicator available at present. This does not provide information on whether breast cancer survival is improving or not.\n\nIn the study 'Survival of breast-cancer patients with previous or subsequent neoplasms', it is shown that patients who have another cancer before or after the development of their breast cancer have a better survival rate than those who have isolated breast cancer. This does not provide information on whether breast cancer survival is improving or not.\n\nBased on these studies, we can conclude that there is no clear evidence that breast cancer survival is improving.\", \n\"answer_choice\": B"]
