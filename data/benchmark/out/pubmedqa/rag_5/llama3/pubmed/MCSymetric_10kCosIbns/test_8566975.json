["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about serovar specific immunity to Neisseria gonorrhoeae. The relevant documents describe the immunological and serological diversity of Neisseria gonorrhoeae, including the concept of immunotypes. Strains of gonococcus were shown to be immunologically heterologous. Serum bactericidal activity generally correlated with induced immunity to gonococcal challenge as detected by the guinea pig subcutaneous chamber model. Sera devoid of bactericidal activity reflected the lack of cross-protection in subcutaneous chambers. Factors affecting the bactericidal assay described in this report include (i) source of complement, (ii) concentration of test antigen and complement activity, and (iii) presence of calcium and magnesium ions and bovine serum albumin in diluent. Poor correlation was observed between agglutinating activity of the immune sera and protection.\n\nImmunization of guinea pigs with Neisseria gonorrhoeae: strain specificity and mechanisms of immunity. Infection of subcutaneusly implanted chambers in guinea pigs conferred immunity against homologous infection of other chambers in the same animals. However, attempts to immunize guinea pigs by subcutaneous injection of filtered fluid from infected chambers, or with small doses of formalin-killed, chamber gonococci were not successful. Thus, neither organisms grown in vivo nor their extracellular products appeared to be exceptionally immunogenic.\n\nRecent studies have demonstrated that virulent (Types 1 and 2) colonial variants of Neisseria gonorrhoeae are highly resistant to phagcytosis by normal human polymorphonuclear leukocytes. To pursue this observation, sera from prostitutes were compared with sera from Catholic nuns in terms of their ability to enhance phagocytosis of Type 1 gonococci.\n\nIn the context of these findings, it is clear that there may be some degree of serovar specific immunity to Neisseria gonorrhoeae, but the extent and importance of this phenomenon are not fully understood.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A: yes\""]
