["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe different scenarios of endoscopic procedures for bile duct issues. One scenario is the use of ERCP for diagnosing and treating purulent cholangitis and hepatic abscess after choledochoduodenostomy, where no nasobiliary drainage tube was inserted. Another scenario is the use of endoscopic biliary drainage for severe acute cholangitis due to choledocholithiasis, which showed a significant reduction in mortality rate compared to surgical decompression. The document on transient obstruction of the common bile duct following its exploration suggests that pseudo-obstruction may occur and can be confirmed by a normal cholangiogram performed after 8-10 days. The case report on nasobiliary drainage for spontaneous bile peritonitis due to cholangiocarcinoma highlights the importance of multiple biliary drainages in improving general condition and tolerating an operation. Finally, the document on intraoperative cholangioscopy provides information on diagnostic results by endoscopic examination of the common bile duct. Considering these scenarios, it appears that routine insertion of a nasobiliary drainage tube may not be necessary after endoscopic clearance of the common bile duct in patients with choledocholithiasis-induced cholangitis.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B: no\""]
