["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the effect of escalating the apical dose on the treatment outcome for beta-radiation of posterior choroidal melanomas with 106Ru plaques. From the given documents, it can be seen that irradiation therapy with beta applicators (106Ru/106Rh) has radiogenic complications but these are less important compared to cobalt-60 applicators. Additionally, a study on optimizing target volume assessment in irradiation of intraocular melanomas with ruthenium applicators shows dose distributions and isodoses for ruthenium applicators. This suggests that the treatment outcome may be influenced by the apical dose. However, there are no direct studies provided to support or contradict this assumption. Therefore, based on the available information, it can be inferred that escalation of the apical dose might potentially change the treatment outcome.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
