["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The provided documents describe various methods for recording medication history, such as using prescription blanks with carbon paper (Multi-script modification of the medication list of the POMR), a four-digit system for coding drugs (Analysis of primary care prescribing--a \\\"constructive\\\" coding system for drugs), and documenting pharmacist consultations (Use of medication orders for monitoring prescribing and documenting consultations).
