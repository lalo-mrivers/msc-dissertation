The study also highlights the significance of phonological awareness in detecting rhymes and its correlation with speech intelligibility, implying that a trained phonological awareness may be beneficial for young children. Furthermore, the document 'Assessing phonology in young children' emphasizes the importance of considering the child's language level when assessing their phonology, which implies that every preschool child may require some form of training or assessment to develop their phonological awareness.
