["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The provided documents discuss temperature-related aspects of kidney preservation. In [Temperature measurements and course in a kidney preservation unit], the behavior and course of temperature meet requirements. [Metabolic changes and assessment of kidney function after supercooling of the free-prepared kidney in animal experiment] shows that temperatures between 0 and +5 degrees C, mainly at an average value of +3C degrees, produce the best results. A novel method of induced renal hypothermia highlights the importance of maintaining surface and core temperatures below 15 degrees Centigrade during transplantation. Minimal physiologic temperature variations during renal ischemia alter functional and morphologic outcome, as demonstrated in [Minimal physiologic temperature variations during renal ischemia alter functional and morphologic outcome]. Lastly, [Ischemia, hypothermia, length of death-perfusion and temperature related factors for preservation of organs] emphasizes the importance of clear establishment of used notions, such as time of hyperthermy, ischaemia, and dead time. Considering these findings, it appears that monitoring temperature during kidney allograft preservation is crucial.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
