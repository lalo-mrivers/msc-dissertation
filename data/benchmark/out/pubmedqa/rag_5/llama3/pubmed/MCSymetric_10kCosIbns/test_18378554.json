["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The provided documents discuss states of agitation, wandering, and cognitive impairment. The first document mentions that inner restlessness can promote the beginning of states of agitation. The second document studies the cognitive discriminants of wandering among nursing home residents. It concludes that wanderers have higher overall levels of cognitive impairment and poorer performance on all cognitive dimensions. The third document discusses agitation and other noncognitive abnormalities in Alzheimer's disease, including wandering and physical nonaggressive agitation. The fourth document provides an overview of agitated behavior in the cognitively impaired elderly.\n\nThe key point is that wandering is a specific type of state of agitation, characterized by poor cognitive performance.
