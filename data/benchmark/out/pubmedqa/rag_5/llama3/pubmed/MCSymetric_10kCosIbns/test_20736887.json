["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking if decompressive surgery is effective for spinal cord sarcoidosis with compressive cervical myelopathy. We can look at the relevant documents to answer this question. The first document discusses a case report of a patient with sarcoidosis presenting as an intradural extramedullary space-occupying lesion in the cervical spinal canal, and treatment with corticosteroids was successful. The second document presents six cases of histologically documented spinal cord sarcoidosis, but it does not specifically mention decompressive surgery. The third document discusses a case report of vertebral sarcoidosis with paravertebral ossification that recovered after laminectomy and cervical fusion on corticosteroid therapy. The last document discusses changes in clinical signs after decompressive laminectomy in cervical spondylosis with myelopathy, but it does not specifically mention spinal cord sarcoidosis. However, it suggests that the operative results were better when the surgical intervention was performed early in the course of the illness.\n\nBased on these documents, we can conclude that decompressive surgery has been successful in treating cases of vertebral sarcoidosis with compressive cervical myelopathy, as seen in the third document. Therefore, the answer is: A: yes.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
