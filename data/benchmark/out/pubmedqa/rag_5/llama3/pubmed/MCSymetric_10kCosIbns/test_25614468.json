["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about preoperative locoregional staging of gastric cancer. From the provided documents, it can be seen that MRI has limitations in staging due to its controversy and no clear role in this context.

Therefore, considering all these points, it seems that MRI has no significant place in preoperative locoregional staging of gastric cancer.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
