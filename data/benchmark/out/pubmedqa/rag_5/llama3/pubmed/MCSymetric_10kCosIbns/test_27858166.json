["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents highlight that blunt injuries to the ascending aorta and branches of the aortic arch are unusual but must be considered in any victim of a high speed decelerating injury. Additionally, blunt injuries to branches of the aortic arch are not unusual and must be considered in any patient surviving deceleration or crush injury. Furthermore, an autopsy case review of 142 nonpenetrating (blunt) injuries of the aorta suggests that the pathogenesis of aortic rupture involves a lateral oblique compression impact to the chest, which causes thoracic mediastinal structures to shift and deflect the aortic arch, resulting in severe shearing and stretching at the isthmus. This information suggests that the anatomy of the aortic arch may influence aortic trauma severity.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
