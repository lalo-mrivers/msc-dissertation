["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant document is 'Anchor fixation and other modifications of endoscopic bladder neck suspension'. According to this document, the study evaluated the long-term efficacy of surgical treatment of stress urinary incontinence by modifying endoscopic bladder neck suspensions with new techniques that reduce the possibility of suspending suture detachment. One of these modifications was pubic bone fixation of the suspending suture using a small anchor developed for orthopedic use. The postoperative success rate at one month was 100 percent, and there were only 4 failures on follow-up up to fifteen months. Therefore, it can be concluded that bone anchor fixation improves the outcome of percutaneous bladder neck suspension in female stress urinary incontinence.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
