["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents suggest that a rapid growth rate of a gallbladder polyp can be an indication of neoplastic changes. In the case report mentioned, a cholesterol polyp with typical ultrasonic findings became atypical with a 40% increase in diameter over a period of about 10 months. The pathological diagnosis was cholesterol polyp with marked glandular proliferation and cystic dilatations filled with dark brown fluid. This rapid growth rate is suspicious for neoplastic changes. Additionally, the study on benign polypoid lesions mentions that some adenomas can show evidence of early adenocarcinoma, suggesting that a rapid growth rate can be indicative of malignant changes.
