["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The provided documents describe research on reading comprehension in various groups, including children with learning disabilities and adults with moderate mental retardation. None of the studies specifically investigate adults with mild intellectual disabilities. However, it can be inferred that adults with moderate mental retardation may not differ significantly from those with mild intellectual disabilities in terms of their reading comprehension abilities. The research suggests that individuals with intellectual disabilities require more instruction to reach mastery criterion on nonideal text structures and that they tend to use inefficient cognitive strategies when reading. Given these findings, it is likely that adults with mild intellectual disabilities can benefit from targeted reading instruction and training to improve their reading comprehension ability.\",\n\"answer_choice\": A"]
