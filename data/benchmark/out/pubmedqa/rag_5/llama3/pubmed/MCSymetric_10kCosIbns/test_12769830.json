["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to the documents, tumor depth is mentioned as one of the factors that were analyzed comprehensively for the hazards rates of tumor mortality, development of a distant metastasis, strictly local recurrence, and postmetastasis survival in 'Refinement of clinicopathologic staging for localized soft tissue sarcoma of the extremity'. The document states that three unfavorable characteristics contained independent prognostic value for the rates of distant metastasis and tumor mortality: high grade (P less than .00001), deep location (P less than .0002), and size greater than or equal to 5 cm (P less than .007). This suggests that tumor depth is an important factor in predicting the prognosis of soft tissue sarcoma.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
