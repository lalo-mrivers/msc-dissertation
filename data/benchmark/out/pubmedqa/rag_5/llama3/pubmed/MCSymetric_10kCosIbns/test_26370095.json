["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents discuss smoking cessation programs during pregnancy. Estimation of break-even point for such programs is mentioned. A model was developed and published data were used to arrive at a break-even point. Break-even costs varied from $10 to $237, with the incidence of preterm low birth weight having the most impact on the cost. This suggests that financial incentives may be necessary to support smoking cessation during pregnancy, especially for certain populations. The study also mentions the cost-effectiveness of a program providing self-help materials and clinician interactions, which was estimated to range from $50-111 per patient. These findings suggest that financial incentives can be effective in supporting smoking cessation during pregnancy.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
