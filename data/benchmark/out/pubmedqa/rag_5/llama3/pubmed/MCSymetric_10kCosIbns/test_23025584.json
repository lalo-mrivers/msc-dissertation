["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking whether stress increases imitation of drinking behavior. Upon reviewing the provided documents, I found that one study (Effects of alcohol consumption on the prevention and alleviation of stress-reactions) suggests that timing, dose, and expectations about alcohol lead to differential effects of alcohol on stress reactions. This implies that stress may not be directly related to imitation of drinking behavior. Another study (Stress and alcohol interaction: an update of human research) indicates that stress does not appear to play a significant role in the control of alcohol ingestion by women and the elderly, but may play a role in adolescents. However, this study does not specifically address the relationship between stress and imitation of drinking behavior. Therefore, based on the available information, it is unclear whether stress increases imitation of drinking behavior.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
