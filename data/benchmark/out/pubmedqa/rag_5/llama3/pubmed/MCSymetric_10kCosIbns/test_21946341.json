["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The provided documents focus on various aspects of atrial fibrillation (A Fib), such as spectral and dynamic analysis, characterization of A Fib, study of electric activity of the heart atria, diagnosis from surface electrocardiograms, and frequency distribution analysis. However, none of these studies directly investigate the relationship between complex fractionated atrial electrograms recorded during A Fib and sinus rhythm fractionation. Therefore, based on the available information, it is unlikely that such a relationship exists.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
