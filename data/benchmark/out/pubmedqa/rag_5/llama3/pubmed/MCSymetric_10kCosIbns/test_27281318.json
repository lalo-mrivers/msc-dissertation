["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents provide information on knee motion, femoral tunnel lengths, and ACL reconstruction. The [Force measurement of reconstructed anterior cruciate ligament in relation to changes in length] study measured the force in an ACL graft over a range of knee flexion. This suggests that force measurements were made for different combinations of tibial and femoral attachment sites. In the [Reconstructive interventions of the posterior cruciate ligament--experimental studies of isometric aspects. Part II: Studies of the posterior cruciate ligament replacement model] study, three different femoral graft placement sites were evaluated for PCL reconstruction. The location of the isometric points was described in part I of the study. None of these studies specifically address flexible instruments creating adequate femoral tunnel lengths at 90Â° of knee flexion in anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
