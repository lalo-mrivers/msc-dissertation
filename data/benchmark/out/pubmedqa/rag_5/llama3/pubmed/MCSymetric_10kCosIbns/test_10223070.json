["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents provided suggest that there is an association between appendectomy and ectopic pregnancy, with the study mentioning an increased risk of ectopic pregnancy after appendectomy (adjusted Odds-ratio: 2.2; 95 percent CI: 1.5-3.2). This suggests that perforation of the appendix may be a risk factor for ectopic pregnancy.

Therefore, it can be inferred that perforation of the appendix may be more strongly associated with ectopic pregnancy than tubal infertility.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
