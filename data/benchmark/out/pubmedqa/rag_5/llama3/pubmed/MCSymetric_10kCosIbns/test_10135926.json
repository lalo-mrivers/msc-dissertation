["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about oral endotracheal intubation efficacy impaired in the helicopter environment. There are two studies mentioned - one with a German (GER) system and an American (AMR) system. The GER system has a trauma surgeon member of the flight crew directing prehospital care on scene, while the AMR system has a nurse/paramedic team with remote medical control. The study showed that in the GER system, 82 out of 221 patients required intubation, which is significantly higher than in the AMR system where only 24 out of 186 patients needed intubation. This suggests that oral endotracheal intubation efficacy might not be impaired in the helicopter environment.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B: no\"\n}"]
