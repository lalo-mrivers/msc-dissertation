["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to the first document 'Longitudinal evaluation of uterine myoma growth during pregnancy. A sonographic study.', an increase in volume during pregnancy was observed in 31.6% of cases, and a statistically significant change in volume was noted between the first and the third trimesters (P < 0.001). The greatest increase in volume of myomas occurred before the 10th week of gestation. This suggests that myomas do grow during pregnancy. Additionally, the second document 'Polyploidy in the human myometrium.' mentions that polyploid nuclei arise only during pregnancy, which also supports the idea that myomas grow during this period. Therefore, it can be concluded that yes, myomas really do grow during pregnancy.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
