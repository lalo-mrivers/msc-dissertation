["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about comparing bicompartmental knee arthroplasty (BKAP) to total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Arthroplasties are surgical procedures. The provided documents describe various surgical procedures, including arthroscopic arthrolysis, arthroscopic lavage and debridement, high tibial osteotomy, polycentric total knee arthroplasty, and total hip arthroplasty. None of the documents mention BKAP or TKA directly. However, we can infer that these procedures might have an effect on knee muscle strength and physical performance. The document about rehabilitation program following polycentric total knee arthroplasty mentions improving postoperative range of motion, but it does not provide information about the specific comparison between BKAP and TKA.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
