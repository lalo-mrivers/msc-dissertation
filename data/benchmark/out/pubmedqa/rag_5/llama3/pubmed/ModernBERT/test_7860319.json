["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about measuring hospital mortality rates. The provided documents seem to focus on different topics such as death rates in a rural village of Ivory Coast, state rate review, nurse mobility and employment patterns, life tables as 'predictors' of average longevity, and perinatal mortality.
