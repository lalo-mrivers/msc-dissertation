["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about audit use to identify maternal mortality. None of the provided documents mention maternal mortality or audit in a way that would help answer this specific question. The topics discussed in the documents are unrelated to maternal mortality, so I will focus on the options. Option C (maybe) could be considered because it acknowledges the possibility of differences between rich and poor settings.
