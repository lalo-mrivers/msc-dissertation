["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the retrieval of lower ureteric stones. None of the provided documents mention ureteric stones or their retrieval. However, one document talks about proximally migrated ureteral stents and its retrieval using a ureteral balloon. Since this is not related to lower ureteric stones, it cannot provide any insight into whether fluoroscopy is essential for their retrieval. Therefore, we have to rely on general knowledge that ureteroscopy is commonly used for the removal of ureteric stones. Fluoroscopy can be used during ureteroscopy to help guide the procedure and ensure the stone is being retrieved successfully.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B: no\"\n}"]
