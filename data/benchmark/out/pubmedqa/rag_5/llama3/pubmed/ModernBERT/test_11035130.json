["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about rheumatoid arthritis patients taking methotrexate and folic acid supplements. The relevant documents don't mention rheumatoid arthritis or methotrexate. However, one document discusses tetracycline therapy for acne, which is unrelated to the question. Another document talks about Nomifensine in Parkinsonism, also not relevant. A third document compares ocular prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors, and the last document discusses beta-adrenoreceptor-blocking agents' effect on lipid metabolism. None of these documents provide information that would help answer this specific question. Therefore, it's necessary to rely on general knowledge or other sources to answer this question.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
