["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about continuous intravenous infusion of low-concentration epinephrine impairing uterine blood flow in pregnant ewes. There is no information provided in the given documents that directly answers this question. However, we can analyze each document to see if any of them relate to epinephrine or uterine blood flow. Document 3 talks about extra-ovular PGE2 infusion and its potential effects on pregnancy termination. It doesn't mention epinephrine at all. Document 4 reports an adverse reaction to extra-amniotic prostaglandin E2, but again, it's not related to epinephrine. The remaining two documents (1 & 2) are unrelated to the topic of uterine blood flow in pregnant ewes.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
