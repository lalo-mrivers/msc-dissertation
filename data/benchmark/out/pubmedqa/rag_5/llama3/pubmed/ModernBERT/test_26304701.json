["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about nurse-led preoperative education for patients undergoing cardiac surgery. The provided documents are related to cardiovascular monitoring, pulmonary alveolar edema, laparoscopic general surgery, and care of the patient post-abdominal aortic aneurysm repair. There is no direct relevance to cardiac surgery or patient anxiety reduction. However, we can analyze the available information: Pulmonary alveolar edema prevention focuses on enhancing cardiac performance, improving oxygenation, and decreasing myocardial workload, which is related to cardiovascular aspects. Laparoscopic general surgery discusses benefits for patient care but does not relate directly to preoperative education or cardiac surgery. The other documents describe specific surgical procedures. No document provides evidence of nurse-led preoperative education reducing anxiety and postoperative complications in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. Therefore, the answer cannot be supported by the provided information.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
