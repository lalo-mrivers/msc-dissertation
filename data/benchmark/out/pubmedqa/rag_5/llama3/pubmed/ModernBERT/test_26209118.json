["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"There is no information provided about bone infarcts or acute osteomyelitis in the given documents. The closest relevant topic is the 'Pulpous hamartoma of the spleen' which does not relate to bone infarcts or acute osteomyelitis. However, one document discusses imaging features of dural venous thrombosis on computed tomography, and another discusses computed tomography scans after psychosurgery showing bilateral cysts in the frontal lobes similar to cerebrospinal fluid. Another document describes sizing acute myocardial infarcts by scintigraphic imaging. There is no information about MRI usage in sickle cell disease patients with bone infarcts or acute osteomyelitis. Based on this, it can be concluded that unenhanced fat-suppressed T1-weighted MRI cannot differentiate between bone infarcts and acute osteomyelitis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
