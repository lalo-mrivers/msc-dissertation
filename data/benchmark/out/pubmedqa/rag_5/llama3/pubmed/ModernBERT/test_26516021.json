["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"No specific document directly answers whether evidence-based practice improves patient outcomes. However, the concept of evidence-based practice is not discussed in any of the provided documents. Therefore, we can't rely on these documents to provide a direct answer. We need to consider more general information about evidence-based practice and its impact on patient outcomes. Generally, evidence-based practice is considered best practice because it's based on scientific research and clinical expertise. This type of approach has been shown to improve patient outcomes in various medical fields. In the context of the documents provided, we can look at the problem-oriented medical record (POMR) and health education model for ambulatory care, which both focus on systematic approaches to patient care. These approaches can be considered evidence-based practice in the sense that they're grounded in clinical expertise and patient data. Therefore, it's reasonable to conclude that evidence-based practice likely improves patient outcomes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
