["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The provided documents focus on neonatal care, cerebral palsy, pulmonary artery sling, fetal cardiocirculatory physiology, and prevention/treatment of neonatal respiratory distress syndrome. There is no direct information about surfactant treatment or chronic lung disease in premature infants. Therefore, the answer must be based on general principles of medical practice. The most relevant document would be 'Prevention and treatment of neonatal respiratory distress syndrome' which discusses fetal lung maturation prior to delivery and treatment protocols for improved mortality and morbidity rates. There is no indication that timing of initial surfactant treatment makes a difference in these outcomes.\", \"answer_choice\": B}"]
