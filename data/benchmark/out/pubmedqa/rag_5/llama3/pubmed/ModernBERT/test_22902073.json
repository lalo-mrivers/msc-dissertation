["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking if ultrasound can be used to estimate fetal weight as a modifiable risk factor for cesarean delivery. After reviewing the provided documents, I found that one of the papers discusses the analysis of obstetric factors related to the survival of 100 newborn infants weighing between 800 and 1,350 grams. This suggests that estimating fetal weight by ultrasound can be used to predict newborn survival. Therefore, it is possible that estimated fetal weight by ultrasound could also be a modifiable risk factor for cesarean delivery.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
