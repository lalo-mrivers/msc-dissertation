["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the bactericidal activity of antiseptic solutions. None of the provided documents discuss this topic directly. However, one document [Drinking waters and drug resistant bacteria. Implications for water quality standards (author's transl)] mentions antibiotic sensibility tests on enterobacteria and Aeromonas isolated from drinking water, suggesting that there are concerns about bacterial resistance. Another document [\\\"Klebsiellae\\\" infections (author's transl)] reports the in vitro activity of antibiotics against Klebsiella isolates. Given this information, I would conclude that there is no direct evidence to support or refute the bactericidal activity of antiseptic solutions.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
