["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about detecting BCRABL transcript by quantitative real-time PCR. There are no relevant documents provided that directly relate to this topic. However, the documents mention various DNA-related techniques such as VNTR typing, flow microfluorometry, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Given these techniques, it's possible to apply a similar approach for detecting BCRABL transcript by quantitative real-time PCR. Therefore, I conclude that correlated results from homebrew assays are feasible.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
