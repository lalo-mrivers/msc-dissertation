["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking if the familial transmission of drinking patterns persists into young adulthood. Upon reviewing the provided documents, I found that none of them directly address this topic. The closest document to this question is 'A longitudinal analysis of alcohol use, environmental conduciveness and normative structure', which discusses adolescent drinking patterns in high school and college.
