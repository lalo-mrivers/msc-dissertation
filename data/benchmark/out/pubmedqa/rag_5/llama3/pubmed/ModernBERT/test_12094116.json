["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the relationship between muscle power and running speed with changes of direction. The relevant document is [Role of information on the forces acting between feet and ground in the process of locomotion control]. It states that the power of bearing reaction was approximately ten times less than that of the muscles for human locomotion along the hard ground, suggesting that muscle power may not be directly related to running speed with changes of direction. Additionally, there is no information provided about the specific forces acting between body and support during changes in direction, which could also affect the relationship.\", \"answer_choice\": A}"]
