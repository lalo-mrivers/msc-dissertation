["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks whether sports medicine journals are relevant and applicable to practitioners and athletes. The first document 'Back school programs' discusses the special concerns in developing a program for retraining professional athletes with back injuries. This suggests that sports medicine journals can be relevant to practitioners working with professional athletes. The second document 'Departments of clinical pharmacology and therapeutics as sources of data' does not provide direct relevance to the question, but it implies that journals can serve as sources of data for professionals in the field. The third document '[Achievements, problems and prospects of hand surgery]' is unrelated to the question. The fourth document 'The new back school prescription: stabilization training. Part II' discusses concepts and goals of sports-specific training programs for rehabilitation of injured athletes. This suggests that sports medicine journals can be relevant to practitioners working with athletes. Finally, the bibliography 'Behavioral science in medical education: a bibliography' is unrelated to the question. Based on this analysis, it appears that sports medicine journals are relevant and applicable to practitioners and athletes.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
