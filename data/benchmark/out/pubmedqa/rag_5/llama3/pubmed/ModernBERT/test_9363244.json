["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is related to occupational nuclear power plant radiation. None of the provided documents specifically address this topic. Document 1 (Radiological health attitudes) discusses general attitudes towards various radiological hazards but does not provide information on its effects on conception and pregnancy. Document 2 (Radiation hazards from 241Am sources) estimates doses corresponding to neck and eye levels, which is different from occupational nuclear power plant radiation. Documents 3 ([Medical consequences of drinking water pollution]) and 4 ([The health status of the crew members of nuclear-powered icebreakers]) do not address conception and pregnancy either. Document 5 (Nuclear area measurement) describes a procedure for measuring nuclear areas on living cells, which is unrelated to the topic. Since none of the documents provide information on occupational nuclear power plant radiation's effects on conception and pregnancy, it can be concluded that there is no direct evidence.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
