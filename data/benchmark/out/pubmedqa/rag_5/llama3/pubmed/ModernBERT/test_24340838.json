["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about ventricular arrhythmias in athletes. The provided documents do not mention anything specific to athletes or long-term changes in cardiac dynamics during exercise. However, the document 'Interpretation of cardiac pathophysiology from pressure waveform analysis: cardiac arrhythmias' mentions various arrhythmias that can produce distorted pressure waveforms and emphasizes the importance of vigilant monitoring of systemic pressures. This suggests that arrhythmias can occur and persist without resolution over time.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
