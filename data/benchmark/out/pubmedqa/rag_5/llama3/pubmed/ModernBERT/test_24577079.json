["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks if strategy training reduces age-related deficits in working memory. There is no information provided about strategy training or its effect on working memory, but we can look at the documents for relevant information. The first document talks about drugs improving memory by manipulating the cholinergic system, which could be related to working memory. However, it does not specifically mention strategy training. The second document discusses aging and the autonomic nervous system, but this is not directly relevant to the question. The third document describes a patient with topographical memory loss after a head injury, which is not related to age-related deficits in working memory. The fourth document talks about genotype x age interaction for neuroticism, which also does not relate to the question. None of the provided documents provide information that would allow us to definitively say whether strategy training reduces age-related deficits in working memory. Therefore, our answer must be based on the options provided: A, B, or C.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"]
