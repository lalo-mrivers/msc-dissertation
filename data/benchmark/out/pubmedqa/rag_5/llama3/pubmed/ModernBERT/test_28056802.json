["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks if non-HDL-cholesterol is a better predictor of long-term outcome compared to LDL-cholesterol. Since the provided documents don't directly answer this question, we need to analyze the information about HDL-cholesterol and its relation to acute myocardial infarction. We know that in patients who had acute myocardial infarction, HDL-cholesterol concentration was significantly lower than in healthy subjects (High density lipoproteins in ischaemic heart disease). This suggests that low HDL-cholesterol may be an important factor in predicting long-term outcome. Since non-HDL-cholesterol includes LDL and VLDL, it's possible that this measure may also be a good predictor of long-term outcome. However, the provided documents don't show a direct comparison between non-HDL-cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol as predictors.\", \"answer_choice\": B}"]
