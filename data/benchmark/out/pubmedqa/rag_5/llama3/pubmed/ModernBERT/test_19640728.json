["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about surgical treatment of prosthetic valve endocarditis in patients with double prostheses. There are no relevant documents that specifically discuss this topic. However, one of the documents describes a case of triple valve involvement in acute bacterial endocarditis, which suggests that single-valve replacement might be possible. Another document discusses the replacement of an aortic valve using a continuous suture technique, which is not directly related to the question but shows that valve replacement can be performed successfully. There are no other relevant documents that provide insight into the treatment of prosthetic valve endocarditis in patients with double prostheses. Therefore, it seems reasonable to assume that the answer would be based on general principles and experience rather than specific data or evidence.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
