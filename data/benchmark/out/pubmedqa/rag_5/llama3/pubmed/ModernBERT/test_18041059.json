["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about adjuvant aromatase inhibitors (AIs) increasing cardiovascular risk in postmenopausal women with early breast cancer. There is no information provided from the given documents about AIs or their effects on cardiovascular risk. However, we can consider other hormone-related topics discussed in the documents. Tamoxifen, an antiestrogen, has agonistic estrogenic activity and may increase the risk of endometrial carcinoma (Endometrial carcinoma in tamoxifen-treated breast cancer patients). On the other hand, progestins have been studied as part of combined treatment for uterine body cancer ([Synthetic progestins in combined treatment of cancer of the uterine body]). No direct information about AIs is available, so we must rely on indirect associations. Hormone-related treatments can have effects on cardiovascular risk (e.g., estrogen/progestin administration may increase gonadotropin requirements [Effect of estrogen/progestin administration on the ovarian response to gonadotropins: a randomized, prospective study]). Considering these points, it seems unlikely that AIs would directly increase cardiovascular risk. However, potential indirect effects cannot be ruled out.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
