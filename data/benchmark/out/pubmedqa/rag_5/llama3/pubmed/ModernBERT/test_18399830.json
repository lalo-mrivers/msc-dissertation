["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents provided are about various surgical procedures such as suprapubic cystostomy, modified radical retropubic prostatectomy, transurethral prostatectomy, treatment of giant intracranial aneurysm with carotid ligation and saphenous vein bypass graft, and laser video-laparoscopic colpopexy. None of these procedures are about robotically assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy or retropubic radical prostatectomy. Therefore, it is not possible to compare the invasiveness of these two procedures based on the provided information. However, we can conclude that there is no evidence in the given documents to support that robotically assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy is less invasive than retropubic radical prostatectomy.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
