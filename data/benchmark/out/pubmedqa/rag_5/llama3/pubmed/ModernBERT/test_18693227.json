["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about geriatric oncology consultation modifying cancer treatment plan for elderly patients. The relevant documents are about nursing assessment of the elderly, day hospital for pediatric cancer, treating patients before and after irradiation, assessment of response to therapy in advanced breast cancer, and closed-circuit television monitoring of problematic radiotherapy patients. None of these documents specifically discuss geriatric oncology consultation modifying cancer treatment plan for elderly patients. However, we can infer that a geriatric oncology consultation might be beneficial in assessing health problems that may affect the surgical outcome, which is mentioned in the nursing assessment document. This would suggest that the consultation might modify the treatment plan to address these health problems.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
