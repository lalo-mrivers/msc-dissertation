["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"This question seems unrelated to the provided documents. However, upon reviewing the documents, we can find some information that might be relevant. The document '[Adrenocortical diagnosis in ambulatory practice]' discusses the diagnostic value of plasma cortisol concentrations and its limitations due to episodic secretion. It also mentions the ACTH test and overnight dexamethasone suppression test as methods for diagnosing adrenocortical insufficiency and Cushing's syndrome respectively. However, this does not provide direct information about late-night salivary cortisol or its relation to obesity and Type 2 diabetes.\n\nThe other documents do not seem directly related to the question. Therefore, we can only rely on general knowledge of cortisol levels in different situations to make an educated guess. High cortisol levels are often associated with Cushing's syndrome, a condition that is more common in obese individuals. Late-night salivary cortisol is also known to be elevated in some cases of Cushing's syndrome.\n\nIn light of this information, we can conclude that late-night salivary cortisol might be a better screening test for possible cortisol excess than standard tests in obese patients with Type 2 diabetes.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
