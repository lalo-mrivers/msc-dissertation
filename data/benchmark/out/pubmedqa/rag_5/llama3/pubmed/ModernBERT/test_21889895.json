["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks whether educating residents about the potential effects of radiation exposure will change CT ordering practices. This is a scenario related to medical technology, specifically imaging technologies like CT scans. The relevant documents mention medical technology, but none directly address CT scans or radiation exposure. However, we can draw parallels with other scenarios discussed in the articles. For instance, the article on port film dosage in radiation therapy highlights the importance of considering potential effects of radiation exposure. Similarly, the article on drugs and diving notes that pressure changes can modify drug effects, which could be relevant to CT scans. Given these analogies, it is possible that educating residents about radiation exposure might lead to a change in CT ordering practices.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
