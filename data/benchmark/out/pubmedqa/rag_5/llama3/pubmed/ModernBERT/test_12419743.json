["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking if single-agent mitoxantrone (mitoxantrone alone) is as effective as combination chemotherapy in treating high-risk metastatic breast cancer patients. Based on the provided documents, we can see that combination chemotherapy with alkylating agents and antimetabolites or doxorubicin appears to give the best response rate. Additionally, chemoimmunotherapy has been shown to be more effective than single alkylating agent alone in stage III ovarian cancer patients. On the other hand, a phase II study of mitomycin C and vinblastine combination therapy showed little clinical efficacy in metastatic breast cancer already refractory to standard chemotherapy and hormonal therapeutic approaches. This suggests that single-agent therapy may not be as effective as combination therapy.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
