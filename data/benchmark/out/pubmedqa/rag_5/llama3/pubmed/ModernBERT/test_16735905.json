["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking if the severity of obstructive sleep apnea predicts patients requiring high continuous positive airway pressure. The provided documents discuss various aspects of ventilation, including negative-pressure ventilators, artificial hyperventilation, and respiratory muscle weakness. There is no direct mention of continuous positive airway pressure or its relationship to obstructive sleep apnea severity. However, the document on respiratory inductance plethysmography during negative pressure ventilation does mention potential artifacts that may influence the measurement of upper airway obstruction.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
