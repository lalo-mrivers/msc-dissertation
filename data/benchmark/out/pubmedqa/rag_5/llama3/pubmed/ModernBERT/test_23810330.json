["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about intraoperative neuromonitoring during open TME. The relevant documents provided are not directly related to TME or prostatectomy. However, there is a document on spinal cord monitoring during operative correction of neuromuscular scoliosis which mentions the use of spinal somatosensory evoked potentials. This suggests that intraoperative neuromonitoring can be used to monitor and prevent neurological deficits during surgical procedures. Therefore, it is likely that intraoperative neuromonitoring would be associated with better functional outcome in patients undergoing open TME.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
