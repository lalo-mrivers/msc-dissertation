["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about routine insertion of a nasobiliary drainage tube after endoscopic clearance of the common bile duct in patients with choledocholithiasis-induced cholangitis. None of the provided documents mention this specific scenario or provide guidance on the use of nasobiliary drainage tubes. However, one document mentions therapeutic applications of catheter cholangiography, which may be relevant to the question.

Therefore, no direct evidence can be found to support or refute routine insertion of a nasobiliary drainage tube in this context.\", \"answer_choice\": B}"]
