["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the provided documents, we can see that profound hypotensive events have been linked to myocardial ischaemic events. For instance, side effects of diazoxide, which includes hypotension, led to severe complications including myocardial infarction in one patient. Additionally, tachycardiomyopathy induced by atrial fibrillation, which was treated with verapamil, resulted in a rapid normalization of myocardial contractility after reducing the heart rate.
