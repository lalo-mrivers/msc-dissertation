["{\n    \"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The provided documents describe various immunoassay methods such as two-site micro enzyme immunoassay, immobilized antibody method, ImmunoDetection technique, and counterimmunoelectrophoresis. The question is asking if the affinity column-mediated immunoassay method can be used as an alternative to microparticle enzyme immunoassay method for blood tacrolimus assay. None of the described methods are specifically related to tacrolimus or affinity column-mediated immunoassay, so it's not possible to directly apply any of these methods to the question.\",\n    \"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
