["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about sternal plating for primary and secondary sternal closure, which suggests a connection to the thoracic spine. None of the provided documents are directly related to this topic. However, one document discusses external fixation apparatuses, but these are not used in sternal plating. Another document describes a light-wire appliance, which is not relevant to the question either. The 'parachute' stent and Short fascial strip--what next? do not provide any information about sternal stability. Therefore, based on the provided documents, it seems that there is no clear evidence for or against sternal plating improving sternal stability.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B: no\"\n}"]
