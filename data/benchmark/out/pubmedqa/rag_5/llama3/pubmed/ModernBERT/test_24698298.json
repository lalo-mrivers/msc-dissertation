["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about MR arthrography of the shoulder. There are no relevant documents mentioning shoulders or arthrography. The documents mention various medical procedures and conditions such as brow ptosis, hernia repair, ureteric lesions, cervical esophagus reconstruction, and palatal ulceration. None of these seem to be related to MR arthrography of the shoulder. As a result, I can't find any information that would suggest we need local anesthesia for this procedure.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
