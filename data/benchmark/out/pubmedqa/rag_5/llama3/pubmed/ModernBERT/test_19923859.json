["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about T-cell deficiency affecting spatial learning ability following toluene exposure. There is no direct connection between the given documents and toluene exposure or spatial learning ability. However, one document mentions the effect of succinyldicholine on central nervous system, which might be relevant. Succinyldicholine has a convulsant action on unanaesthetized mice and rats, distinct from its curarelike effect on muscle. Although this is not directly related to T-cells or spatial learning ability, it shows that the given documents do contain information about the central nervous system. Therefore, we can conclude that the question 'Can T-cell deficiency affect spatial learning ability following toluene exposure?' cannot be answered based on the provided documents.\", \"answer_choice\": B}"]
