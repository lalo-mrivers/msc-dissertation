["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking if biofeedback training can enhance athletes' sport performance. In the 'Effect of antecedent muscle tension levels on motor behavior' document, it is stated that elevated levels of pre-competition muscle tension were found to disrupt hand steadiness and grip strength. This suggests that high levels of muscle tension can negatively impact athletic performance. The same document also states that biofeedback relaxation techniques may significantly improve the performance of competitive athletes hampered by particularly high levels of pre-competition muscle tension. Additionally, in the 'Biofeedback heart rate training during exercise' document, it is shown that experimental subjects who received beat-to-beat heart rate biofeedback during exercise had lower mean heart rates and systolic blood pressure compared to control subjects. This suggests that biofeedback training can help athletes better regulate their physiological responses during exercise, which may enhance their performance. Finally, in the 'Effect of heart-rate control training on heart-rate discrimination' document, it is shown that feedback training improved accuracy of heart rate discrimination. This implies that biofeedback training can improve athletes' ability to control and regulate their physiological responses, potentially leading to enhanced sport performance.\",\n\"answer_choice\": A\n}"]
