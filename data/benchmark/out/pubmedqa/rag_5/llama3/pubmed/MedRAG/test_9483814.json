["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about para-cervical block and its advantages in abortion induction with gemeprost in the 2nd trimester. None of the provided documents explicitly discuss para-cervical block or gemeprost, but they do mention prostaglandins as a method for inducing abortion in the second trimester. The literature reviews prostaglandin therapy for various indications, including therapeutic termination of second trimester pregnancy and ripening of the cervix. However, none of these documents provide information on para-cervical block or its potential advantages in this context.\n\nThe only relevant mention is the comparison of different methods for midtrimester abortion, which found that each method had its advantages and disadvantages. This suggests that there may be varying approaches to achieving successful outcomes in second trimester abortions.\n\nIn the absence of specific information on para-cervical block, it seems reasonable to consider the overall tone of the documents. They suggest that prostaglandin therapy can be effective for inducing abortion in the second trimester, but also emphasize the need for further refinements and improvements in techniques.\n\nGiven this context, it appears that the question is seeking information on a specific technique (para-cervical block) that is not explicitly discussed in the provided documents. This means that we must rely on general information about prostaglandin therapy and its potential advantages.\n\nThe key consideration here is whether para-cervical block offers additional advantages over prostaglandin therapy alone. The answer is 'no' because there is no evidence to suggest that para-cervical block is necessary or beneficial in this context.\", \"answer_choice\": B}"]
