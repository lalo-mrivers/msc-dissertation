["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"In order to determine if ISAC 112 is a reproducible technique for determining specific IgE against components, we need to examine the relevant documents provided. The documents highlight the importance of specificity and standardization in allergen extract methods, including RAST-based assays and skin prick testing. We also see discussions on the characterization of allergenic extracts using monoclonal antibodies and the limitations of bio-assays. Considering these points, it appears that ISAC 112 is likely a standardized method for determining specific IgE against components.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
