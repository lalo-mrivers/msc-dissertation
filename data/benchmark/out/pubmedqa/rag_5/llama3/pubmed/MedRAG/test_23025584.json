["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks if stress increases imitation of drinking behavior. The first document suggests that men who drank alcohol maintained high levels of anxiety while men who had a placebo did not. This implies that the presence of stress does not increase the likelihood of drinking behavior, but rather people who drink may experience increased anxiety in stressful situations. The second and third documents do not provide information directly related to the question, but they suggest that there is no strong temporal association between stressful life events and the onset of alcohol problems. The fourth document suggests that women more often develop a response to crises and emotional stress through drinking, while men gradually drift into dependence on alcohol. This implies that stress may be a trigger for some people to drink, but it does not necessarily increase imitation of drinking behavior. Therefore, based on this information, the answer is B: no.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
