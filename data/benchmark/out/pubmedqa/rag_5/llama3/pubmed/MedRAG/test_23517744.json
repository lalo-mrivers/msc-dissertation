["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the given documents, it can be inferred that the effect of ischemia on vascular resistance is time-dependent. Initially, there is an increase in vascular resistance proportional to the duration of warm ischemia up to 60 min. However, this increase does not further increase after 180 minutes. Furthermore, when both the renal artery and vein are clamped, the pattern is less emphatic, with a maximum resistance reached at 60 minutes. This suggests that prolonged ischemia may not result in increased vascular resistance, which is contrary to the idea of solitary kidney being more resistant to ischemia.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
