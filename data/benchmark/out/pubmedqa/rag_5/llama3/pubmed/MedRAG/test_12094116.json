["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking if muscle power is related to running speed with changes of direction. Let's look at the relevant documents. The first document talks about biomechanics of sprint running and mentions various factors such as reaction time, technique, electromyographic (EMG) activity, force production, neural factors and muscle structure. However, it does not specifically mention changes of direction. The second document is about muscle strength and power changes during maximal isokinetic training. Although it discusses training velocity, it does not mention changes of direction either. The third document talks about muscle force-velocity and power-velocity relationships under isokinetic loading. While it mentions different velocities, it does not specifically discuss changes of direction. The fourth document is about growth-related change in specific force but not in specific power of rat fast skeletal muscle. It does not mention running or changes of direction at all. Finally, the fifth document discusses the effect of fatigue on maximal power output at different contraction velocities in humans. Although it mentions different pedaling rates, it does not specifically discuss changes of direction. Therefore, based on these documents, we can conclude that there is no direct evidence to support a relationship between muscle power and running speed with changes of direction.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
