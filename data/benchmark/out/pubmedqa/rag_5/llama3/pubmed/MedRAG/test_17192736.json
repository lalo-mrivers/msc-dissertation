["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about fluoroscopy's role in retrieving lower ureteric stones. In the 'Transurethral extraction of ureteral stone guided by television fluoroscopy' document, we see that TV fluoroscopic monitoring was used to remove ureteral calculi transurethrally. This suggests that fluoroscopy can be helpful for retrieval of lower ureteric stones. However, in other documents like 'Balloon dilation of the distal ureter to 24F: an effective method for ureteroscopic stone retrieval' or 'Percutaneous nephrostomy in the management of ureteral and renal calculi', there is no specific mention of fluoroscopy being essential for lower ureteric stones. Therefore, we can conclude that fluoroscopy may be helpful but not necessarily essential for retrieval of lower ureteric stones.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
