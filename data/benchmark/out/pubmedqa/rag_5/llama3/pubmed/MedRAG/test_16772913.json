["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about comparing deflation rates of two types of breast implants. None of the provided documents explicitly discuss this specific topic or provide data on deflation rates for textured saline breast implants. The closest relevant information can be found in [Effect of inadequate filling of deflation of inflatable breast prostheses. Statistical study of 535 inflatable prostheses], which describes a study on underinflation and deflation due to late rupture. However, this study only looks at initial fillings and does not provide direct comparison between different implant types. Therefore, it is difficult to draw conclusions about the question from the provided documents.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
