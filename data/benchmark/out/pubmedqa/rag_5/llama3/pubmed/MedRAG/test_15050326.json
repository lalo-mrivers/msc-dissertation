["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant document that discusses radiotherapy for Hodgkin's disease is 'Pregnancy outcome in survivors of advanced Hodgkin disease'. The document reports on the treatment protocols used during the study period from 1966 to 1986. It does not specifically discuss the relationship between radiotherapy and breast cancer risk around the time of pregnancy. However, it does mention that radiation therapy was used as part of the treatment protocol for Hodgkin's disease. Additionally, another document 'Breast carcinoma in women previously treated for Hodgkin disease: mammographic evaluation' suggests that scattered radiation to the breast during mantle irradiation may increase the risk of developing breast cancer. Therefore, while there is no direct evidence in this specific study, we can infer that radiotherapy around the time of pregnancy for Hodgkin's disease may modify the risk of breast cancer.\",\n\"answer_choice\": A"]
