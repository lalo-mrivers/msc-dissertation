["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about decompressive surgery being effective for spinal cord sarcoidosis with compressive cervical myelopathy. In the given case report 'Tetraplegia secondary to cervical sarcoidosis. Case report', a patient with vertebral sarcoidosis causing collapse of cervical vertebrae and resulting tetraplegia was successfully treated by decompression and subsequent anterior removal of the invaded three vertebral bodies, followed by an autologous bone graft. This suggests that decompressive surgery can be effective for spinal cord sarcoidosis with compressive cervical myelopathy. Additionally, in the case report 'Decompressive laminectomies with clinical improvement but persistent myelographic blocks', three cases of postoperative clinical improvement despite persistent subarachnoid blocks are reported. This highlights that even if radiological evidence of compression persists, decompressive surgery can still be effective for treating spinal cord compression.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
