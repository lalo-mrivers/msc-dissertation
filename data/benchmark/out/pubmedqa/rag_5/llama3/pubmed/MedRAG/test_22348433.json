["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about partial expander deflation exacerbating the adverse effects of radiotherapy in two-stage breast reconstruction. The documents provided are related to breast reconstruction using implants or expanders after mastectomy. None of the documents specifically address the combination of partial expander deflation and radiotherapy. However, one document mentions radiation as a factor contributing to implant loss (4 in 176 reconstructions). This suggests that radiation may have an adverse effect on the outcome of breast reconstruction. There is no direct evidence to support or refute the idea that partial expander deflation exacerbates these effects.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B\n}"]
