["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the influence of simultaneous use of neuroendoscope on ventriculoperitoneal shunt infection incidence. We can look at the risk factors for postoperative neurosurgical infection and see if neuroendoscope is included as one. According to the first document, the risk factors include altered sensorium, multiple operations, pre-existing infection, emergency surgery, duration of surgery more than 4 hours, urinary catheterisation, cerebrospinal fluid leak, and ventilatory support.
