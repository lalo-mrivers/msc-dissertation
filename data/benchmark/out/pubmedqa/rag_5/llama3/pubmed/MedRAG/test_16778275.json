["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents describe various methods of lung biopsy, including transbronchial lung biopsy through the fiberoptic bronchoscope. One document mentions that a diagnosis was obtained in 96 patients (72%) out of 133 patients with diffuse or peripherally localized lung diseases without endobronchial lesions. Another document reports that adequate pulmonary tissue was obtained in 14 (93.3%) out of 15 patients, and a pathologic diagnosis was made in nine patients (64.3%). There are no mentions of complications related to chest radiography after the biopsies. Therefore, it seems that routine chest radiography after transbronchial biopsy may not be necessary.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
