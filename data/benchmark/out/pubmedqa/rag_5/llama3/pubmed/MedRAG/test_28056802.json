["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe studies on factors influencing long-term prognosis in male patients surviving a first coronary attack. One study found that low HDL-C was strongly predictive of subsequent cardiovascular events in subjects with CAD, despite desirable TC. Another study found that serum cholesterol was significantly related to all four end points, including mortality from all causes and incidence of nonfatal myocardial infarction plus coronary death, in both univariate and multivariate regression analyses. A recent meta-analysis of trials on secondary prevention of CHD by cholesterol lowering found significant reductions in recurrent non-fatal and fatal CHD, with a downward trend in total mortality. Based on these findings, it is clear that serum cholesterol levels are an important predictor of long-term outcome in patients after acute myocardial infarction.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
