["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, it seems that total pancreatectomy is recommended for resectable pancreatic carcinoma, especially when there is no lymphatic involvement or extrapancreatic invasion. This procedure is suggested to be radical and may be necessary to remove all cancerous tissue. Total pancreatectomy has been shown to have a longer survival rate compared to partial pancreatoduodenectomy (Whipple's procedure). There are also factors that can limit resectability, such as invasion of large vessels, lymph node involvement, and diffuse intrapancreatic tumor spread. Therefore, it seems that the covering of the resection margin after distal pancreatectomy is not a key consideration in this context.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
