["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about 30-day and 1-year mortality rates in emergency general surgery laparotomies. The relevant documents describe various studies on abdominal surgery in elderly patients, general surgery in patients aged 80 years and older, and abdominal operations for intraabdominal metastases from extraabdominal primary tumors. Emergency procedures are associated with higher mortality rates compared to elective operations. The study on immediate resection in the treatment of large bowel emergencies reported an operative mortality rate of 15 per cent. Based on these findings, it can be concluded that emergency general surgery laparotomies do have a significant impact on mortality rates.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
