["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe physiological aspects of menopausal hot flushes, behavioral treatment options, and objective indices for measuring hot flashes. Sternal skin conductance is mentioned as a method for objectively measuring hot flushes in the 'Behavioral treatment of menopausal hot flushes: evaluation by ambulatory monitoring' document. This method was used to measure the effectiveness of paced respiration training in reducing hot flush frequency. The 'Elevations in skin temperature of the finger as an objective index of postmenopausal hot flashes: standardization of the technique' document describes a different approach to measuring hot flashes, using skin temperature changes of the finger. However, both methods are based on the principle that changes in skin conductance or temperature can be used to objectively measure hot flushes. Therefore, sternal skin conductance is a reasonable surrogate for hot flash measurement.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
