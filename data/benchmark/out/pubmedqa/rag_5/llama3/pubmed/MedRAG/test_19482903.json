["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about treadmill testing of ambulatory children with spina bifida. The documents provided don't have direct information on treadmill testing or peak oxygen uptake. However, the document 'An exercise testing program for large populations' discusses a demonstration cardiovascular evaluation and exercise testing program that was assessed for feasibility, cost, and accuracy. This suggests that exercise testing is possible in this population. Additionally, the document 'The place of exercise testing in the investigation of patients with respiratory disorders' highlights the importance of exercise testing in clinical assessment and the value of different procedures. While these documents don't specifically answer the question about peak oxygen uptake, they provide context for understanding exercise testing in children with spina bifida. Therefore, it can be inferred that peak oxygen uptake might reflect maximum oxygen uptake based on general principles of exercise testing.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
