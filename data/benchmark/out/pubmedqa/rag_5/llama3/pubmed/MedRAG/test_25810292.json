["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents discuss various techniques for mitral valve repair and replacement. The first document describes a modified continuous suture technique for mitral valve replacement. The second document presents a measured tricuspid annuloplasty technique, which involves principles similar to those used in operative repair of the mitral valve. The third document discusses the advantages of mitral valve repair over replacement, citing a study on patients with pure mitral insufficiency. The fourth document describes a surgical technique for artificial mitral chordae implantation, which is a type of minimally invasive mitral valve repair. This technique has been applied in more than 50 patients and shown to be effective. Based on these documents, it can be concluded that minimally invasive mitral valve repair with artificial chords is reproducible and applicable in routine surgery.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
