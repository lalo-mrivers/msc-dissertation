["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the contribution of general practitioner hospitals in England and Wales, a survey of their workload, and an audit of referrals to an acute surgical unit. There is no direct information about whether these hospitals reduce the utilisation of general hospital beds. However, one of the surveys mentions that 3% of acute hospital beds in England and Wales were in general practitioner hospitals, which provided initial hospital care for up to 20% of the population. This suggests that general practitioner hospitals do not necessarily reduce the utilisation of general hospital beds, but rather provide alternative forms of care.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
