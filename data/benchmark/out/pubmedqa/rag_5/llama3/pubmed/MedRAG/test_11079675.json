["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is related to pulmonary valve replacement in adults after repair of tetralogy of Fallot. The relevant documents describe various surgical procedures for this condition, including reoperative procedures and valve replacements. In one document, it is mentioned that 1 of the 22 initial repairs, 7 of the 22 first reoperations, and 5 of the 6 second reoperations involved pulmonary or tricuspid valve replacement. Additionally, some patients received transannular RVOT patches. There are no specific indications in these documents for when to perform pulmonary valve replacement, but it can be inferred that it may be necessary in certain cases due to recurrent deterioration. Therefore, without more information, it is difficult to determine whether the timing of pulmonary valve replacement in adults late after repair of tetralogy of Fallot is 'too late'.\",\n\"answer_choice\": A"]
