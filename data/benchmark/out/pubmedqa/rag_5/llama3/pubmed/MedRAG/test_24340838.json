["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, we can see that ventricular arrhythmias are more frequent in athletes than in non-athletes. The document 'Reversibility and benign recurrence of complete heart block in athletes' suggests that complete heart block induced by fitness is benign, even when symptomatic, which implies that some athletes may experience reversible cardiac issues. Additionally, the document '[Ventricular late potentials in athletes]' shows that ventricular late potentials are not rare in sportsmen, and they seem always to appear together with left-ventricular hypertrophy. While there is no direct answer to whether ventricular arrhythmias subside over time for athletes, these documents suggest that some cardiac issues may be reversible or benign.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
