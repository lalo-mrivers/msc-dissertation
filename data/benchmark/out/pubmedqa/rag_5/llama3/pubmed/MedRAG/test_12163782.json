["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks whether increased neutrophil migratory activity after major trauma is a factor in the etiology of acute respiratory distress syndrome. We can look at previous studies on neutrophil chemotaxis and function to inform our answer. Neutrophils are important for lung defense, but impaired neutrophil chemotaxis has been observed in patients with burns (Neutrophil chemotaxis in patients with burns). Additionally, the function of lung and blood neutrophils is impaired in patients with adult respiratory distress syndrome (The function of lung and blood neutrophils in patients with the adult respiratory distress syndrome. Implications for the pathogenesis of lung infections.), which could contribute to the high incidence of pulmonary infections in these patients. Suppressed in vitro chemotaxis of burn neutrophils has also been observed, suggesting that impaired neutrophil chemotaxis may be a factor in the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
