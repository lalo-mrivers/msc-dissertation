["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks if confined placental mosaicism accounts for adverse perinatal outcomes in IVF pregnancies. The relevant documents suggest that confined placental mosaicism is associated with increased frequency of second and third trimester pregnancy loss or intrauterine fetal growth retardation (Spontaneous abortion and confined chromosomal mosaicism). Additionally, confirmation of CVS mosaicism in term placentae shows a higher rate of prenatal loss (22 per cent) as well as the presence of intrauterine growth retardation. Furthermore, Trisomy 16 confined to chorionic villi and unfavourable outcome of pregnancy suggests that a trisomy 16 confined to placental tissue has a negative effect on fetal growth and pregnancy outcome. However, Chorionic mosaicism: association with fetal loss but not with adverse perinatal outcome suggests that the previous studies did not show any correlation between chorionic mosaicism and adverse perinatal outcomes. Lastly, Mosaic autosomal trisomy in cultures from spontaneous abortions indicates that the frequency of mosaicism is higher than that reported in Down syndrome. Therefore, considering these findings, it is possible to conclude that confined placental mosaicism may account for some adverse perinatal outcomes in IVF pregnancies.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
