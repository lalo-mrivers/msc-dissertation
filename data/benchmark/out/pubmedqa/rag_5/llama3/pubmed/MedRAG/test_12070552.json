["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about antibiotics decreasing post-tonsillectomy morbidity. We have several documents discussing tonsillitis treatment, including peritonsillar abscesses. The first document mentions that immediate tonsillectomy has lessened patient morbidity since two separate surgical procedures were avoided and the total period of hospitalization was reduced by nearly 50%. This suggests that antibiotics may not be directly decreasing post-tonsillectomy morbidity, but rather providing a more efficient treatment approach. The other documents discuss antibiotic treatments for tonsillitis and peritonsillar abscesses, including one document comparing clindamycin to no antibiotic treatment. While these studies show the effectiveness of antibiotics in treating infections, they do not specifically address post-tonsillectomy morbidity.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
