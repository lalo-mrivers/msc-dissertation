["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about whether distance is worth it. Upon reviewing the documents, I noticed that some of them mention distance in different contexts.

In 'Patients, doctors and medical education', there's a discussion about an increasing interpersonal distance between doctors and patients affecting the quality of medical care.
