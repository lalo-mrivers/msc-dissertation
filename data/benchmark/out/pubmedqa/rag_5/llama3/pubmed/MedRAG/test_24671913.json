["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks if SYNTAX score predicts in-hospital outcomes in patients with ST elevation myocardial infarction undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention. None of the provided documents discuss SYNTAX score or its relation to in-hospital outcomes. Therefore, I will rely on general knowledge and the provided information to answer the question.
