The second paper 'Plasma methadone measurements and their role in methadone detoxification programs' only discusses plasma methadone measurements during detoxification and does not mention medical records.

The fourth paper 'Guidelines for the management of hospitalized narcotics addicts' provides guidelines for managing addicted patients during hospitalization, but it does not specifically mention documenting opioid dependence or MMT in medical records.
