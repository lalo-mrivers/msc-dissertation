["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant document 'Epidermal growth factor receptor in lung malignancies. Comparison between cancer and normal tissue.' states that epidermal growth factor receptors (EGFr) were measured using a radioligand binding assay, in membrane preparations from 51 human non-small cell lung cancers and in normal tissue of the same patients. The binding characteristics of EGFr were similar in tumour and normal lung membranes. However, the concentrations in tumours were significantly higher than in normal tissues. No molecular probes or studies about serum analysis are mentioned in this document.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
