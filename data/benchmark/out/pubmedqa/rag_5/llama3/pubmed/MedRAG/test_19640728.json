["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about surgical treatment of prosthetic valve endocarditis in patients with double prostheses. In the given documents, there are cases of single-stage replacement and two-stage replacement for prosthetic valve infective endocarditis. The document '[Late-stage prosthetic valve infective endocarditis. Report of 2 cases]' suggests that surgical intervention is necessary because medication has poor results. The same document also recommends removing infected tissue thoroughly and tightening the new prosthetic valve to prevent bleeding. This implies that single-valve replacement may be a viable option. Additionally, the document 'Infective endocarditis--analysis of 116 surgically and 26 medically treated patients' shows that surgical treatment has better results than medical treatment in cases of active prosthetic valve endocarditis. Therefore, based on these findings, it can be concluded that single-valve replacement is a safe option for treating prosthetic valve endocarditis in patients with double prostheses.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
