["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the need for neck dissection in metastatic carcinoma to the cervical nodes from an unknown head and neck primary site. The relevant documents suggest that patients with potentially curable neck tumours had a 64% three-year survival rate after treatment, while those with incurable neck masses or supraclavicular nodes had a much poorer prognosis.
