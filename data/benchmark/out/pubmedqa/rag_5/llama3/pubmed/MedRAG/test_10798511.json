["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking if CT scanning of the abdomen is always necessary for blunt trauma patients. The relevant documents describe the use of CT scanning in blunt abdominal trauma patients, including those with shock, multiple injuries, and delayed rupture.

This suggests that CT scanning can be a useful tool in evaluating blunt abdominal trauma patients, including those who may be intoxicated.\", \"answer_choice\": B}"]
