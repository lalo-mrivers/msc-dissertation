["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks whether patients with rheumatoid arthritis established on methotrexate need to continue folic acid supplements long term. Methotrexate can cause folate deficiency as an adverse effect. The first document suggests that the probability of continuing MTX therapy for up to 5 years was 46%. The second and third documents suggest that patients who were in remission or showed significant improvement could be treated with a fortnightly regimen, which implies that the frequency and dose of MTX can be adjusted depending on the patient's response. There is no mention of folic acid supplements in these documents. Therefore, it seems that folic acid supplements are not necessarily required long term if patients respond well to MTX treatment.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
