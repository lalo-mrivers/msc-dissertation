["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Breast conservation operations for early stage breast cancer aim to achieve excellent local/regional control and survival. The selection of patients for conservation depends on various factors such as tumor size, cell type, location, and mammographic picture. It is crucial to select patients where an equivalent survival can be expected. The literature suggests that the results of breast-conserving operations are comparable to those of modified radical mastectomy for average-sized tumors. However, smaller tumors do well with breast removal. There is a challenge in demonstrating long-term results of breast conservation in earlier stage disease equaling mastectomy. Furthermore, recurrence in the radiated breast usually is diagnosed and treated at a more advanced stage than the disease initially treated conservatively. Therefore, it is essential to adopt uniform methods for assessing margins in breast-conservation operations.\",\n\"answer_choice\": A"]
