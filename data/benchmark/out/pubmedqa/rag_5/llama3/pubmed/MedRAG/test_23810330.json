["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking whether intraoperative neuromonitoring is associated with better functional outcome in patients undergoing open TME. This is a different scenario than the ones described in the provided documents. The documents describe various techniques for monitoring specific functions or structures during surgery, such as motor cortex mapping, cortical stimulation, and facial nerve monitoring. None of these scenarios directly relate to open TME (transanal microsurgical excision). Therefore, we cannot conclude whether intraoperative neuromonitoring is associated with better functional outcome in patients undergoing open TME.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
