["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about teaching medical students to investigate medication errors and changing their attitudes towards patient safety. The relevant documents talk about pharmacological education, professional attitudes of doctors and medical teaching, medical student training in doctor-patient communication, and the nurse educator and the legal implications. It seems that the question is related to the development of attitudes, knowledge, and skills of clinicians who practice effective pharmacotherapy (document 1). This requires defining attitudes, knowledge, and skills of clinicians and evaluating the proficiency of prescribers at certification and in actual practice. The documents also mention the importance of patient-centred attitudes in doctor-patient communication (document 3) and the liability of nurse educators for giving negligent instructions and advice (document 4). Therefore, it is likely that teaching medical students to investigate medication errors can indeed change their attitudes towards patient safety.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
