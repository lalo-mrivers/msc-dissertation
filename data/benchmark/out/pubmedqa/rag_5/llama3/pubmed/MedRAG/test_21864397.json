["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about factors determining the survival of nasopharyngeal carcinoma with lung metastasis alone. The relevant documents suggest that local control is important in determining long-term outcome. In one study, 24% of patients developed distant metastases, which correlated with nodal status but not with T stage. In another study, 13% of patients had recurrences in the neck and 34% had distant metastases after radical neck dissection for recurrent nasopharyngeal carcinoma. These studies suggest that local control is crucial, and combined modality treatment may benefit by improving local control.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
