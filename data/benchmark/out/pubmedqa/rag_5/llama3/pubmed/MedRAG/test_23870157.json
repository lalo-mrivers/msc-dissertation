["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks if intraoperative precursor events are associated with postoperative major adverse events. In the provided documents, we can find a study on Detection and significance of intraoperative and postoperative myocardial ischemia in peripheral vascular surgery. This study finds that intraoperative ischemia was present in 21 patients (18%), and postoperative ischemia was present in 35 (30%). There were 16 postoperative cardiac events. The relative risk of suffering a cardiac event was 2.7 in patients with intraoperative ischemia and was 16 in patients with postoperative ischemia. Preoperative ischemia closely correlated with intraoperative and postoperative ischemia. This suggests that intraoperative precursor events are indeed associated with postoperative major adverse events.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
