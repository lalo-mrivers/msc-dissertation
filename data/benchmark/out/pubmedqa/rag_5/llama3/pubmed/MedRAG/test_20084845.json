["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about biomolecular identification of allergenic pollen. The provided documents are related to allergy diagnosis, characterization of allergens, and exposure control. None of the documents explicitly mention biomolecular identification of allergenic pollen. However, one document (Use of monoclonal antibodies for the characterization of allergenic extracts) discusses the use of monoclonal antibody technology to characterize and purify allergens. This could be related to biomolecular identification of allergenic pollen. Another document (Structure of respiratory allergens) mentions the characterization of respiratory allergens using modern immunological, chemical, and genetic techniques. While not specifically mentioning pollen, this could also relate to biomolecular identification. Therefore, based on these documents, it is possible that biomolecular identification of allergenic pollen is a valid perspective.\",\n\"answer_choice\": A\n}"]
