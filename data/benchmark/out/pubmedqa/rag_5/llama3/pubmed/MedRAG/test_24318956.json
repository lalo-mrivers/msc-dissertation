["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"After reviewing the provided documents, it's clear that estrogen-based treatments are associated with cardiovascular risks. In the study on cardiovascular risks induced by estrogens prescribed at low doses, it was found that even low-dose estrogen treatment can induce cardiac events.
