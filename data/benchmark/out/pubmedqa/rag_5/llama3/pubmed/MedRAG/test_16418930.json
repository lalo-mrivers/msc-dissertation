["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The provided documents describe various aspects of amblyopia, including its relationship with strabismus, eccentric fixation, and motion-defined form. One document specifically mentions Landolt C and grating acuity being compared to the expected visual function of the eccentric fixation region for 10 strabismic amblyopes. This suggests that there may be differences in visual function between these amblyopes and others. Another document discusses the relationship between strabismus and amblyopia, but does not explicitly mention Landolt C or Snellen acuity. The third document describes the results of testing a group of patients with unilateral amblyopia, including measurements of speed threshold for recognizing motion-defined dotted letters, recognition acuity for isolated solid letters of 4% contrast, and Snellen line acuity for high-contrast letters. None of these documents provide direct evidence supporting or refuting differences in Landolt C and Snellen acuity between strabismic amblyopia.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
