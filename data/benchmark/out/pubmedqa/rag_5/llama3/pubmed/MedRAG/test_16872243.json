["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks whether decisional algorithms can replace global introspection in the individual causality assessment of spontaneously reported ADRs. The relevant documents describe various approaches to diagnosing adverse drug reactions (ADRs), including algorithms that provide operational criteria for ranking the probability of causation when an ADR is suspected between a drug and a clinical manifestation. These algorithms have been shown to improve the reproducibility and validity of clinicians' assessments of ADRs. This suggests that decisional algorithms can be useful in the diagnosis of ADRs, but it does not necessarily mean they can completely replace global introspection. Therefore, the answer is likely B: no.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
