["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about enhancing transdermal absorption of topical lidocaine using fractional lasers. We need to analyze the provided documents for any information related to laser-induced transdermal drug delivery. Sonophoresis (document 3) discusses the use of ultrasound to enhance transdermal delivery, but it doesn't mention lasers. Percutaneous absorption studies (documents 2 and 4) don't provide any information about laser-based enhancement methods. Skin as an active metabolizing barrier (document 1) is a theoretical analysis of topical bioavailability, not specifically related to laser-enhanced drug delivery. Therefore, we can rule out documents 1-3. Document 4 discusses the relevance of in vitro data for percutaneous absorption studies and doesn't provide any information about lasers. Since none of the provided documents mention fractional lasers or their potential to enhance transdermal absorption of topical lidocaine, we can conclude that there is no evidence to support or refute this claim.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
