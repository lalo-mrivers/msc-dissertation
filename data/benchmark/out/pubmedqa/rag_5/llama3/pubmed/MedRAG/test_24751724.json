["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking if ethnicity affects where people with cancer die. From the provided documents, we can see that there are racial differences in ill-defined cancer mortality in the United States and in the District of Columbia (Racial differences in ill defined cancer mortality in the United States and in the District of Columbia). Specifically, it states that 'The mortality rate due to ill defined cancers is greater among blacks (19.3 per 100,000) than whites (13.2 per 100,000) (RR = 1.5)'. This suggests that there are higher rates of cancer deaths among black individuals compared to white individuals. Additionally, the study found that 'The highest rates were clustered in the central states (23 per 100,000) and the lowest rates were seen in the mountain and western states (17 per 100,000)' for black individuals. This further supports the idea that ethnicity does affect where people with cancer die.\",\n\"answer_choice\": A\n}"]
