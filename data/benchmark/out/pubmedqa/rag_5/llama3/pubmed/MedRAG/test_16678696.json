["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the continuity of care experience of residents in an academic vascular department. Since the documents provided are related to vascular surgery, I will analyze the information presented. There is no direct answer provided that explicitly states 'yes' or 'no'. Therefore, I will consider the overall tone and content of the documents. The documents discuss the importance of special training programs for vascular surgeons, their need for a fund of knowledge and surgical skills beyond general surgery, and the proposal to upgrade vascular surgery by certifying training programs.
