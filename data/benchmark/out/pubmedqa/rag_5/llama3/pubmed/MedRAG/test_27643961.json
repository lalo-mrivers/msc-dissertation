["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks if comorbidity between major depression and alcohol use disorder leads to poorer outcomes of depression. The relevant documents describe the relationship between these disorders in various populations. Among adolescent psychiatric inpatients (Patterns of affective comorbidity in a clinical population of dually diagnosed adolescent substance abusers), both primary and secondary depressive disorders were common, but the primary-secondary paradigm did not predict remission or family history of comorbid disorders. This suggests that depression is a complex disorder and comorbidity may not necessarily lead to poorer outcomes. In fact, one study found no evidence for comorbidity itself being familial (Alcoholism and primary major depression: A family study approach to co-existing disorders). Therefore, based on these studies, it seems unlikely that comorbidity leads to poorer outcomes of depression.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
