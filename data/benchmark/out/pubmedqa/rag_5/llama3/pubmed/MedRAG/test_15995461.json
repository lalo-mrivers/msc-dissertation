["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about injury mortality rates across different U.S. states. We can look at the documents provided to see if they provide information on this topic. One document mentions the Los Angeles County Trauma System, but it does not compare injury mortality rates between states. Another document discusses mortality patterns in the United States as a whole, but it does not provide state-specific data. The other two documents are about specific types of injuries and do not provide information on injury mortality rates across different U.S. states. Therefore, based on the available information, we can conclude that some U.S. states may have higher or lower injury mortality rates than others.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
