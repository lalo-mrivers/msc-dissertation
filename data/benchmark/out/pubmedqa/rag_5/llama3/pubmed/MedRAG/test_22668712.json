["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"After reviewing the documents, I did not find any information that suggests the authors were discussing internal derangement of the temporomandibular joint. The articles focus on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT), and radiographic studies for diagnosing various conditions related to the temporomandibular joint.
