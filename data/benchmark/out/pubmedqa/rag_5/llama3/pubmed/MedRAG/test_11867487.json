["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"None of the provided documents directly address whether rugby headgear prevents concussion. However, they provide relevant information about concussions and cervical spinal injuries sustained during rugby tackles and collisions. Specifically, the 'Cumulative effect of concussion' document suggests that repeated concussions can have cumulative effects, while the 'The high rugby tackle--an avoidable cause of cervical spinal injury?' document highlights the risk of trauma to the cervical spine caused by the force applied to the neck in a high tackle.
