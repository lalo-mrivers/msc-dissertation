["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking if magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can accurately predict concordant pain provocation during provocative disc injection. The relevant documents are about discography, MRI, and their correlation. According to the article 'A correlation between magnetic resonance imaging and discography', MRI patterns were classified based on nuclear signal intensity and posterior anulus status, but it was found that in many cases MRI could not reliably predict or replace discography. This suggests that MRI may not be able to accurately predict concordant pain provocation during provocative disc injection.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
