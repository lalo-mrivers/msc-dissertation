["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, it seems that there is a lack of information specific to African-American women's dietary needs.

This could be attributed to cultural factors, such as lesser intensity of weight-loss motivations, which are discussed in the first document 'Models for dietary and weight change in African-American women: identifying cultural components'.
