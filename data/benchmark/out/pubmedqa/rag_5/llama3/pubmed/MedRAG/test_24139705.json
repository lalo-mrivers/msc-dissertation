["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about whether technology alone can improve glycaemic control in type 1 diabetes. Looking at the provided documents, there are mentions of telemedicine and home monitoring systems, which could be relevant to this question. However, none of the documents specifically discuss type 1 diabetes or compare telemedicine with other methods. The document on 'Improved care of patients with diabetes through telecommunications' does mention a study that showed improved serum glucose control using computer-assisted communication of medical information, but it doesn't isolate the impact of technology alone. Therefore, based on the available information, it seems unlikely that technology per se can be sufficient to improve glycaemic control.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
