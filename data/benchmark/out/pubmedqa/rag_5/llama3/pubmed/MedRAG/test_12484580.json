["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks whether a written information sheet improves recall by patients for total hip arthroplasty. We have three documents to consider: one about informed consent, one about the results of implant retrieval from postmortem specimens, and one about observations on the myth of 'informed consent'. From the first document, we know that only 20 out of 100 patients tested postoperatively were able to recall accurately major portions of their informed consent interview. From the third document, we see that an overall recall rate of 35% was found in a series of 100 patients. Given these findings, it's clear that there is room for improvement in patient recall. The question then becomes whether providing a written information sheet improves this recall. This is where the second document comes in - it talks about the importance of documentation in the clinical record. While this isn't directly related to the effectiveness of written information sheets, it does suggest that providing patients with more information could be beneficial. Therefore, we can conclude that a written information sheet may improve recall by patients.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
