["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking whether the horizontal semicircular canal ocular reflex is influenced by otolith organs input. From the given documents, it can be seen that otolith-ocular reflexes play an important role in vestibulo-ocular and vestibulo-spinal reflexes, and are likely a source of symptoms in patients with vestibular disorders. The study on Otolith-ocular testing in human subjects shows that several stimuli, including linear acceleration and/or changes in the orientation of the head with respect to gravity, can be used to evaluate otolith function. The Three-dimensional head angular velocity detection from otolith afferent signals study demonstrates how central signal processing can reconstruct 3D head angular velocity even without semi-circular canal related information, showing that otolith organs carry information about head orientation and changes of head orientation relative to gravity. Therefore, it is likely that the horizontal semicircular canal ocular reflex is influenced by otolith organs input.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
