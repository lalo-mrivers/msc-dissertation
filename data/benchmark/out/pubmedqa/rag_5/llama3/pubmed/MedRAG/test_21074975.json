["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about ultra high risk (UHR) for psychosis criteria and whether there are different levels of risk for transition to psychosis. Upon reviewing the provided documents, I did not find any specific information that directly answers this question. However, I can think step-by-step about how psychotic disorders are classified and evaluated in these studies.\n\nThe document 'The concept of recovery and secondary prevention in psychotic disorders' discusses functional psychoses and their classification, but it does not provide criteria for ultra high risk (UHR) or different levels of risk for transition to psychosis.\n\nThe study on 'Early prediction of relapse in schizophrenia: an application of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) methods' evaluates different methods for identifying prodromal periods and predicting relapse, but it does not specifically address UHR or different levels of risk.\n\nThe document 'Methodological issues in using a polydiagnostic approach to define psychotic illness' discusses the challenges of defining psychotic disorders, but it does not provide information on UHR or different levels of risk.\n\nThe study on 'High dosage neuroleptic therapy. A review.' reviews the literature on high-dose neuroleptic treatment and its effectiveness, but it does not address UHR or different levels of risk.\n\nLastly, the document 'Brief reactive psychosis and the major functional psychoses: descriptive case studies in Africa' compares brief reactive psychosis with other psychotic syndromes, but it does not provide information on UHR or different levels of risk.\n\nIn conclusion, based on these documents, I could not find any specific information that directly answers this question. Therefore, my step-by-step thinking suggests that the answer might be unclear or unknown.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C: maybe\""]
