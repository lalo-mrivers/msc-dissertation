["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents mention the correlation between serum concentration of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-OH-D) and the stage of clinical disease. In small children with nutritional vitamin D deficiency, the serum concentration of 25-OH-D was low in advanced stages. Patients with familial hypophosphatemia (X-linked dominant), mean serum 25-OH-D concentration was the same as in age-matched normal controls. One document also describes a patient with celiac disease who developed osteomalacia and responded to oral administration of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3. Another study highlights growth failure due to symptomless celiac disease, which may be related to vitamin D deficiency.\",\n\"answer_choice\": A"]
