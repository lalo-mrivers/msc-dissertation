["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the biochemical aspects of cell death, mitochondrial gene organization and expression, mitochondrial protein import, structural dynamics of the mitochondrial compartment, and the plant cytoskeleton. None of these texts explicitly mention mitochondria playing a role in remodelling lace plant leaves during programmed cell death. The focus is on cellular injury and death at the molecular and cell-biological level, mitochondrial function and pathology, and the plant cytoskeleton. There is no mention of plant leaves or programmed cell death.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
