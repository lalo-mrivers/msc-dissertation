["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the documents provided, it can be inferred that there is a difference between unicompartmental knee replacement and total knee arthroplasty. The documents highlight five key principles that differentiate unicompartmental knee replacement from total knee arthroplasty. Unicompartmental polycentric knee arthroplasty is described as a procedure reserved for conditions affecting predominantly one side of the joint, whereas load testing of geometric and polycentric total knee replacements suggests that failures occurred in some specimens at load levels normally encountered across the knee joint during ambulation. The major determinants of stress failure were identified as the tibial bone strength, the design of the geometric and polycentric tibial component, and the method of component implantation. Therefore, it can be inferred that the type of tibial component may affect mechanical alignment in unicompartmental knee replacement.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
