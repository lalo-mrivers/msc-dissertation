["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents provide information on state cigarette tax increases, their effect on cigarette sales, and trends in Canadian tobacco sales. The study on the 1989 California cigarette tax increase shows a sharp drop in cigarette consumption coincident with the tax increase. Similarly, the study on state cigarette tax increases from 1955 to 1988 shows that larger tax increases were associated with larger declines in consumption. This suggests that increasing cigarette taxes can lead to higher prices. The document on trends in Canadian tobacco sales also shows that despite high taxes, the price of tobacco products continues to be a 'bargain' for smokers. However, the study on tobacco advertising restrictions, price, income and tobacco consumption in OECD countries does not provide direct evidence linking tax increases to retail prices. Nevertheless, the overall trend suggests that higher taxes can lead to higher prices.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
