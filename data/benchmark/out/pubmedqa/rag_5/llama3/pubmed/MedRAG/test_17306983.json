["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The provided documents describe various techniques for aortic valve replacement, annular enlargement, aneurysm treatment, and aortic reinforcement. One technique described is the use of a homograft valve with aortic annular enlargement in pediatric patients. Another technique involves reinforcing the ascending thoracic aorta using Dacron vascular prosthetic material. A third technique uses a composite graft and reimplantation of coronary arteries for total aortic root replacement. None of these techniques specifically mention size-reducing ascending aortoplasty with external reinforcement. Therefore, it can be concluded that this technique is not mentioned in the provided documents.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
