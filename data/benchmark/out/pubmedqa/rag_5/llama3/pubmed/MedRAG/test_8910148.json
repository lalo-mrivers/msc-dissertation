["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the suitability of marginally acceptable hearts for transplantation. The provided documents are related to cardiac transplantation and allografts, but none of them directly address the specific question. However, we can infer that a 'marginally acceptable heart' would likely be a diseased heart, as opposed to a healthy one. The documents do discuss the advantages of bypassing the patient's own diseased left ventricle with a cardiac allograft, which suggests that using an allograft might be beneficial in certain situations.

Considering these points, it is unclear whether marginally acceptable hearts are suitable for transplantation.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
