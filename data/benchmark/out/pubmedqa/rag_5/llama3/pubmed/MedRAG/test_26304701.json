["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking if nurse-led preoperative education can reduce anxiety and postoperative complications of patients undergoing cardiac surgery. Step 1: We look at the documents provided to see if there are any studies or research that relate to this topic. Step 2: We find that one study, 'Predictors of general activity 8 weeks after cardiac surgery', investigates the influence of mood states and self-efficacy beliefs on recovery of general activities 8 weeks after cardiac surgery. This suggests that preoperative education can have a positive impact on patients undergoing cardiac surgery. Step 3: Another study, 'A comprehensive analysis of preoperative patient education', highlights the importance of preoperative teaching in relieving emotional stress and supporting patients during surgery. This further supports the idea that nurse-led preoperative education can be beneficial for patients undergoing cardiac surgery. Step 4: Finally, we look at the document 'Effect of preoperative anaesthetic visit on anxiety' which suggests that preoperative reassurance about anaesthesia from a member of the hospital staff (possibly an anaesthetic nurse) can significantly reduce anxiety levels in patients. This reinforces the idea that nurse-led preoperative education can have a positive impact on patient anxiety.\",\n\"answer_choice\": A"]
