["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The provided studies focus on mortality rates among different age groups and populations. The study 'Black-white mortality differences by family income' suggests that even after controlling for income, blacks have higher mortality rates than whites. This implies that there are socioeconomic factors beyond income that contribute to these differences. Similarly, the study 'Survival after early and normal retirement' found that pre-retirement health status was a significant predictor of survival after retirement.
