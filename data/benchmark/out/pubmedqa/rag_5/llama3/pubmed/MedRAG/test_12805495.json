["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"After reviewing the documents, it is clear that anticoagulant therapy can increase the risk of intracerebral hemorrhage. For example, the document 'Intracerebral haemorrhage after thrombolytic therapy for acute myocardial infarction' reports on seven cases of intracerebral haemorrhage following the use of thrombolytic therapy. Similarly, the document 'Early heparin therapy in patients with spontaneous intracerebral haemorrhage' investigates the effect of early heparin treatment and found that it is safe but can increase the risk of rebleeding.
