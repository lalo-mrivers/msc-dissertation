["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the prognosis of low-tone sudden deafness (LTSD) specifically. According to the first document, 6 cases out of 80 patients with LTSD progressed to Meniere's disease. The time between onset of LTSD and diagnosis of Meniere's disease ranged from 4 months to 6 years and 8 months. This suggests that not all cases of LTSD progress to Meniere's disease, but some do. Additionally, the document highlights that two pattern types were seen in the change from LTSD to Meniere's disease: changing within a short period after recurrence of an LTSD-like attack, and changing after more than one year without recurrent attack. This further supports the idea that not all cases of LTSD progress to Meniere's disease. Therefore, based on the provided documents, I conclude that the answer is B: no.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
