["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking whether chest wall irradiation should be included after mastectomy for breast cancer patients with negative nodes. Upon reviewing the documents, it's clear that positive axillary nodes are a key factor in determining whether chest wall irradiation is necessary. For early stage carcinoma (Stage I), total mastectomy and post-operative radiation therapy to the chest wall and regional lymph nodes can be effective treatment. However, for patients with more advanced disease or those with larger tumors, the documents suggest that aggressive resection and reconstruction may be necessary to improve quality of life. Finally, a retrospective analysis found that 27% of patients with positive axillary nodes developed recurrence in the chest wall region, suggesting that chest wall irradiation may be beneficial in certain patient populations.\n\nGiven these findings, it appears that chest wall irradiation should only be included after mastectomy for breast cancer patients with negative nodes if they have other risk factors or a history of advanced disease. Therefore, the answer is: B: no\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
