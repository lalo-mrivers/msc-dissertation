["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about improving reading comprehension ability in adults with mild intellectual disabilities. The first document suggests that a simple intervention using colored overlays can produce immediate improvements in reading comprehension abilities. However, this study focuses on children with reading disability. The second and third documents discuss developmental reading disorder and learning disabilities, but do not specifically address adults with mild intellectual disabilities.

Therefore, there is no conclusive evidence to support or refute the claim that adults with mild intellectual disabilities can improve their reading comprehension ability.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B: no\"\n}"]
