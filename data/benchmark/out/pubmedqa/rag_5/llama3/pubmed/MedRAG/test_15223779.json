["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about c-Kit-dependent growth of uveal melanoma cells. The documents provided are related to tumor-associated antibodies, cutaneous melanoma, the putative melanoma tumor-suppressor gene on human chromosome 6q, and ocular melanoma-associated antigens. None of these documents directly mention c-Kit or its role in uveal melanoma growth. Therefore, based on the available information, it is unlikely that c-Kit-dependent growth of uveal melanoma cells has been studied.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
