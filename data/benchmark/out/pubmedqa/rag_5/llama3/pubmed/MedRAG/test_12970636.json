["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking if early discharge with nurse home visits affects the adequacy of newborn metabolic screening. There are no documents that directly address this specific topic. However, we can look at studies that discuss early discharge and home follow-up of very low birthweight infants (Functions of the CNS in early discharge and home followup of very low birthweight infants) and a perinatal-care program featuring early discharge with home care (Perinatal care of low-risk mothers and infants. Early discharge with home care). Neither study specifically mentions newborn metabolic screening. Although there is no concrete evidence to support or refute the question, it seems unlikely that nurse home visits would significantly affect adequacy of newborn metabolic screening.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
