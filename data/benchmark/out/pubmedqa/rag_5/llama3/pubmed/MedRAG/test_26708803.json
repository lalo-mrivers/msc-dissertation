["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the treatment of contralateral hydrocele in neonatal testicular torsion. The relevant documents discuss cases of neonatal testicular torsion and inguinal hernia, but they don't specifically address the treatment of contralateral hydrocele in this context. However, one document suggests an inguinal approach with contralateral orchiopexy for prenatal (in utero) testicular torsion. This implies that orchiopexy might be a suitable treatment option for contralateral hydroceles. Therefore, it can be inferred that 'less' (i.e., orchiopexy) is indeed more in this context.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
