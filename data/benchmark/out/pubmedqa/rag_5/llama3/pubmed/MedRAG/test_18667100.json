["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks if risk factors for suicidal behavior differ by affective disorder polarity. We need to look at the provided documents to find relevant information about suicide risk factors and affective disorders. In 'Schizophrenia--a high-risk factor for suicide: clues to risk reduction', we see that schizophrenics are overrepresented among suicides, and often constitute the majority of inpatient suicides. Research has yielded salient risk factors for suicide in schizophrenic persons, even though statistical prediction of individual suicides has not proven effective.\n\nIn 'Risks of mortality of suicide attempters compared with psychiatric and general populations', we find that the relative risk of death from all causes of the suicide attempt group was nearly twice that of the general population. High risks of mortality were differentially associated with several demographic and treatment variables.\n\nWe also have information about suicidal ideation and depression in 'Suicidal wishes and depression in suicidal ideators: a comparison with attempted suicides'. We see that individuals who show differing kinds of suicidal behavior nonetheless may show similar psychological phenomena, including depression. It seems that depression is a risk factor for suicide.\n\nIn 'Sex differences in suicidal behaviour of referred adolescents', we find that psychosocial stressors increase the probability of high suicidal scores, particularly in adolescents with an affective disorder. An affective diagnosis doubles the probability of high scores for both boys and girls. This suggests that having an affective disorder increases the risk of suicide.\n\nIn 'Patterns of death among suicide attempters, a psychiatric population and a general population', we see that premature deaths due to suicide are strongly associated with the suicide attempter group. The study found that a profitable approach to the prevention of suicide would be to focus on individuals who were at high risk within the suicide attempter population.\n\nFrom these documents, it seems that depression is a risk factor for suicide, and having an affective disorder increases the risk of suicide. Affective disorders can be either bipolar or unipolar, so it's possible that risk factors differ by polarity.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
