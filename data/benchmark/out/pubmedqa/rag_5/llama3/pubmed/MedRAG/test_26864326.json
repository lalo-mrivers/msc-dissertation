["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks whether nurses can better predict admission at triage compared to a simple objective score. We have documents related to nurse triage from the emergency department, mental hospital patients, and acute care settings. The Triage Assessment Tool emphasizes the importance of clinical judgment and experience in making precise triage decisions. In the study on effectiveness of nurse triage, there were no deaths, and error was mainly due to underestimated severity of illness or mistaken diagnosis. This suggests that nurses can make accurate predictions about admission at triage.\n\nIn the study on early determinants of required nursing care hours, data collected in the first 24 hours of hospitalization were used to predict average daily and total nursing care hours. This implies that nurses can assess patients' requirements for care quickly after admission.\n\nThe document 'Outcome criteria: a process for validation at the unit level' reports the development of a process for validating sets of outcome criteria, which was tested by staff nurses. This suggests that nurses are capable of assessing outcomes of nursing care and making predictions about patient needs.\n\nIn comparison to a simple objective score, nurse triage appears to be more effective in predicting admission at triage. Nurses have clinical judgment and experience, which enables them to assess patients' conditions accurately. Therefore, the answer is\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A: yes\""]
