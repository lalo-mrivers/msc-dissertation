["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the anatomy and neurophysiology of the hippocampal formation. The coexistence of GABA and glutamate in mossy fiber terminals is demonstrated by postembedding immunocytochemistry. Additionally, an ultrastructural study shows that GABA immunoreactivity was present in mossy fibre terminals that made synaptic contact with complex embedded spines of identified Golgi-impregnated CA3 pyramidal neurones. Serial sections of the same mossy fibre terminals were shown to be immunoreactive for both glutamate and GABA.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
