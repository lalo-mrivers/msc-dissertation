["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about detecting BCRABL transcripts using quantitative real-time PCR. The provided documents describe the use of PCR for detecting minute amounts of bcr-abl hybrid mRNA from malignant cells and monitoring residual disease in chronic myelogenous leukemia by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. These methods have been used to detect the bcr/abl rearrangement in patients with CML or ALL. Therefore, it is possible to obtain correlated results from homebrew assays using these methods.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
