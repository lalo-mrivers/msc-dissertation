["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking whether the affinity column-mediated immunoassay method can be used as an alternative to microparticle enzyme immunoassay for blood tacrolimus assay. The relevant documents discuss different immunoassay methods, including flow injection immunoassays and fluorescence immunoassays. However, there is no mention of microparticle enzyme immunoassay or tacrolimus specifically. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the suitability of the affinity column-mediated immunoassay method as an alternative to microparticle enzyme immunoassay for blood tacrolimus assay based on the provided information.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
