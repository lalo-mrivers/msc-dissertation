["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe various methods for assessing myometrial invasion by endometrial carcinoma using magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, including nonenhanced T2-weighted and contrast material-enhanced T1-weighted MR imaging. The studies highlight the importance of preoperative knowledge of myometrial tumor extension in patients with early-stage endometrial cancer. However, none of the documents specifically discuss body diffusion-weighted MR imaging of uterine endometrial cancer or its usefulness in detecting cancer in nonenhanced MR imaging. Therefore, it is not possible to draw a definitive conclusion about the helpfulness of body diffusion-weighted MR imaging for this purpose based on the provided information.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
