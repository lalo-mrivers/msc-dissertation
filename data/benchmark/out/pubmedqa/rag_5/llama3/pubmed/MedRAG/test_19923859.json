["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Firstly, we need to identify the relationship between T-cell deficiency and spatial learning ability. There is no direct information provided about this specific scenario (toluene exposure). However, we can consider analogous studies that might be relevant. For instance, there is a study on trichloroethylene exposure where psychological functions, including reaction time and short-term memory, were tested but did not show any decrement in performance. This suggests that the effect of T-cell deficiency on spatial learning ability might be negligible.\n\nAdditionally, we can look at studies related to T-cell immunity and their roles in delayed-type hypersensitivity responses. These studies suggest that both short-lived (T1) and long-lived (T2) T cells contribute to primary and secondary responses. Although this is not directly relevant to the specific question, it does imply that T-cell deficiency might have a broader impact on immune functions rather than specifically affecting spatial learning ability.\n\nConsidering these points, we can infer that the answer is likely 'B: no' as there is no direct evidence suggesting that T-cell deficiency affects spatial learning ability following toluene exposure.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
