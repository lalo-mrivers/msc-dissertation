["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"After reviewing the documents, I noticed that none of them discuss the relationship between body mass index (BMI) and gastric cancer patients after gastrectomy. The first document discusses the surgical management of carcinoma of the stomach, but it does not mention BMI. The second document is a population-based study on prognostic factors after curative surgery for gastric cancer, and it only considers tumor location, size, gross appearance, extension within the gastric wall, and number of proximal lymph nodes involved. The third document discusses gastric surgery for morbid obesity, but it does not provide any information about BMI's influence on morbidity and long-term survival in gastric cancer patients after gastrectomy. The fourth document is a study on death due to recurrence following curative resection of early gastric cancer, and it only considers age as a factor. Therefore, there is no relevant data to support or refute the influence of BMI on morbidity and long-term survival in gastric cancer patients after gastrectomy.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
