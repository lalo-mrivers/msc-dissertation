["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking if renal warm ischemia over 30 minutes during laparoscopic partial nephrectomy is possible. From the provided documents, we can see that temporary occlusion of the left renal artery for 0-180 min after contralateral nephrectomy was undertaken in 51 rabbits (influence of warm ischaemia on renal function and pathology). After occlusion for 150 min only 4 of 10 animals survived, and normal renal function was not re-established. 180 min occlusion was detrimental to the animals. Only one out of ten survived with severely damaged kidney function.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
