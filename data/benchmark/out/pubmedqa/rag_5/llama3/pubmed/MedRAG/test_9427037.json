["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the provided documents, we can infer that the expression of VEGF is induced in astrocytoma cells but dramatically upregulated in glioblastoma cells. Additionally, platelet-derived growth factor receptor-beta (PDGFR-beta) is expressed in endothelial cells of low and high grade gliomas, particularly in glioblastomas. The expression of PDGFR-beta in the tumor microvessels was confirmed by double immunofluorescence. Astrocytomas are highly malignant brain tumors that are among the most neovascularized solid tumors. Therefore, it can be concluded that endothelial cell patterns may not be indicative of grade as they are overexpressed in both astrocytoma and glioblastoma.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
