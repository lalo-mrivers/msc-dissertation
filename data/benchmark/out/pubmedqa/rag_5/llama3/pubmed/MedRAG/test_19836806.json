["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents suggest that prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels are associated with prostate volume. In the document 'Determination of prostate volume with transrectal US for cancer screening', it is stated that statistically significant increases in mean PSA values were noted with increasing gland volume ranges. This suggests a relationship between PSA and prostate volume. Additionally, in the document 'Relationship between prostatic acid phosphatase and prostate-specific antigen serum levels and prostatic volume in benign prostate hyperplasia', it is mentioned that PSA tended to be higher when glandular component was more expressed, which implies an association with prostate size. Therefore, adjusting PSA for body mass index (BMI) may not be necessary as the relationship between PSA and prostate volume has been established.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
