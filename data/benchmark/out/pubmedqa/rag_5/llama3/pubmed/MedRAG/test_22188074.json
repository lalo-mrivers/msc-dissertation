["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents provide information on demented elderly patients, dementia in Parkinson's disease, a longitudinal study of women aged 70-79 years living in a rural community, the incidence of dementia, and cued recall for early identification of dementia. None of these studies provide direct answers to the question about instrumental activities of daily living predicting dementia at 1- and 2-year follow-up. The closest relevant information is from 'Factors affecting decisions to institutionalize demented elderly' which discusses social psychological characteristics, type and number of caregivers, and subjective caregiver distress as predictors of institutionalization, but not specifically on instrumental activities of daily living. Therefore, based on the available information, it cannot be determined whether instrumental activities of daily living predict dementia at 1- and 2-year follow-up.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
