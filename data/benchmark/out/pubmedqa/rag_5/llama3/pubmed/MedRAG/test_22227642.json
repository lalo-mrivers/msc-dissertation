["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"After reviewing the provided documents, I found that none of them explicitly mention measuring mesopic pupil size with cobalt blue light slit-lamp biomicroscopy. However, one document (Pupillary size and responsiveness) discusses pupillary size under different lighting conditions, including dim and bright illumination. Another document (A new photostimulator and videopupillograph for quantitative neuroophthalmological studies) describes a new photostimulator with quantitatively variable light output, which could be used to measure pupil size. However, it does not specifically mention cobalt blue light or slit-lamp biomicroscopy.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
