["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about serovar specific immunity to Neisseria gonorrhoeae. The relevant documents suggest that immunotypes of N. gonorrhoeae are antigenically distinct and new immunotypic strains which were highly protective were identified from cultures isolated in different geographical areas and from patients with various clinical manifestations. Also, it is mentioned that inhibition of epithelial cell adhesion for individual strains of Neisseria gonorrhoeae is antigenically distinct. These findings suggest that serovar specific immunity may exist.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
