["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The provided documents discuss various aspects of thyroid carcinoma diagnosis and treatment. One document highlights the importance of frozen section in determining the presence or absence of carcinoma during surgery. Another document discusses the accuracy of different diagnostic methods for thyroid lesions, including fine-needle biopsy, frozen-section, and paraffin-section diagnoses. There is no specific information on multinodular thyroid disease, but one document mentions that patients with early or localized thyroid cancer can be controlled with less than total thyroidectomy if certain conditions are met. This suggests that the surgical management of multinodular thyroid disease may not necessarily involve frozen section.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
