["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks if a zero central line-associated bloodstream infection rate is sustainable. We can infer that the authors are looking for evidence-based answers to this question. The documents provided discuss various aspects of intravascular device infections, including catheter-related sepsis and the importance of strict adherence to appropriate infection control procedures. One study specifically examines the incidence of infection with prolonged use of central vascular catheters and finds no significant difference in infection rates between changing catheters every three days or when clinically indicated. Another study notes that using a guide wire increases the risk of bloodstream infection. Based on this information, it appears that achieving zero central line-associated bloodstream infections may be challenging.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
