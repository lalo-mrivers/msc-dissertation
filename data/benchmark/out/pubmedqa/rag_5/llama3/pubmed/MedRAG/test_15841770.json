["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking if inhaled steroids differ from cromones in terms of hospital admission rates for asthma in children. We can look at the relevant documents to answer this question. The first document mentions a 4.5-5 fold increase in overall rates of admission during the survey period, with no specific mention of inhaled steroids or cromones. The second document talks about severe bronchial asthma and factors influencing intensive care management and outcome, but does not provide information on hospital admission rates for different medications. The third document mentions a study on the outcome of short-term hospitalization for children with severe asthma, but again does not provide information on hospital admission rates for different medications. The fourth document discusses the use of beclomethasone dipropionate aerosol in managing 42 severe asthmatic children, but does not provide information on hospital admission rates.\n\nThe only relevant information that can be found is from the first document which mentions a changing pattern of admissions with a downward trend in admission rates for school-aged children and a continuing upward trend in the preschool age group. There is also an alarming new trend mentioned - a rise in the numbers of preschool girls admitted with acute asthma: admission rates for this group have shown a three-fold increase since 1983.\n\nThere is no specific information on whether inhaled steroids differ from cromones in terms of hospital admission rates for asthma in children, so we cannot say that they do or do not. Therefore, the answer must be B: no.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
