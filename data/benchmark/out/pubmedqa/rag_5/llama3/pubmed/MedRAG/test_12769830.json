["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to the first document, Management of small soft-tissue sarcoma of the extremity in adults, neither postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy nor radiation therapy resulted in superior 5-year survival or local recurrence-free survival when compared with no postoperative treatment. This suggests that tumor depth is not a significant factor in determining prognosis.\n\nThe second document, Refinement of clinicopathologic staging for localized soft tissue sarcoma of the extremity: a study of 423 adults, shows that high grade, deep location, and size greater than or equal to 5 cm contained independent prognostic value for the rates of distant metastasis and tumor mortality. This suggests that depth is an important factor in determining prognosis.\n\nThe third document, Current concepts in the treatment of soft tissue sarcomas, does not provide any information about the significance of tumor depth in determining prognosis.\n\nThe fourth document, A clinical and pathological staging system for soft tissue sarcomas, presents a staging system based on clinical characteristics, including size, extension, involvement of lymph nodes, presence of metastases, and grade of the tumor. This suggests that tumor depth is one of several factors that should be considered in determining prognosis.\n\nBased on this information, it appears that tumor depth is an important factor to consider when prognosticating for soft tissue sarcoma.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
