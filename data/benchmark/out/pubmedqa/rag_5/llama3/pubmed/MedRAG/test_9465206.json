["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks if MRI can substitute for diagnostic arthroscopy. The documents highlight the effectiveness of MRI in diagnosing knee injuries, particularly meniscal and cruciate ligament tears. Arthroscopy is also mentioned as a valuable tool, but it cannot be performed in every patient with knee symptoms. The study on magnetic resonance imaging of meniscal and cruciate injuries shows that MRI is highly sensitive, specific, and accurate in evaluating the menisci and anterior cruciate ligament. Another study found that MRI can accurately diagnose meniscal and cruciate ligament tears using a higher-resolution scanning protocol. This suggests that MRI has a high diagnostic accuracy for knee lesions. Given these findings, it appears that MRI can indeed substitute for diagnostic arthroscopy.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
