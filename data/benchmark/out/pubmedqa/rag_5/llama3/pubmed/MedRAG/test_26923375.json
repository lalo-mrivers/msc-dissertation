["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about non-invasive diagnosis of esophageal varices in patients with compensated hepatic cirrhosis. The relevant documents mention duplex Doppler ultrasonography as a method to detect specific signs of portal hypertension, which can indicate the presence of gastroesophageal varices. In one of the studies, it was mentioned that duplex Doppler ultrasonography may have a clinical role in non-invasive detection of portal hypertension. This suggests that duplex Doppler ultrasonography could be used to diagnose esophageal varices. Additionally, another study mentions that ultrasound can provide direct information about lesions in internal organs, including the development of periportal fibrosis and enlargement of the portal vein, which can indicate portal hypertension. This further supports the possibility of using duplex Doppler ultrasonography for non-invasive diagnosis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
