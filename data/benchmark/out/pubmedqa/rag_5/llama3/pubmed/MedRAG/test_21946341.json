["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking if there's a relationship between complex fractionated atrial electrograms recorded during atrial fibrillation and sinus rhythm fractionation. We need to look for relevant information in the provided documents that talks about abnormal atrial electrograms, fractionated right atrial endocardial electrograms, and their distribution within the right atrium. The study mentions that prolonged and fractionated right atrial endocardial electrograms are characteristic of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (idiopathic or associated with sick sinus syndrome). We also know that abnormal atrial electrograms were observed in 8 (19.5%) control patients, and in 16 (48.5%) sinus node dysfunction patients; p < 0.02. The mean duration (75.6 +/- 17) and the mean number of fragmented deflections (4.1 +/- 2) of the total atrial electrograms in the sinus node dysfunction group was significantly greater than that in controls (70.9 +/- 11 and 3.6 +/- 1, respectively); p < 0.01. Therefore, we can conclude that there is a relationship between complex fractionated atrial electrograms recorded during atrial fibrillation and sinus rhythm fractionation.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
