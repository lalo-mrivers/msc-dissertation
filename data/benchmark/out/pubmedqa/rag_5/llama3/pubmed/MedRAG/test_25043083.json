["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about failures of anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. In the provided documents, there are cases where nonunion of a tibial bone plug led to failure of two previous anterior cruciate ligament reconstructions. The document on biomechanics of the human posterior cruciate ligament shows that the force in the posterior cruciate ligament is sensitive to attachment site position, particularly at the femoral insertion site. However, this study does not provide information about steep posterior tibial slopes or their association with failures of anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
