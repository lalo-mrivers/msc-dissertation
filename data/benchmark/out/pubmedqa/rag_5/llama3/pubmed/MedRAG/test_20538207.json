["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents discuss the importance of reducing warm ischemic time, flushing the kidney with hypothermic solution, and maintaining the organ at low temperature during preservation ex vivo. This suggests that monitoring temperature during kidney allograft preservation is crucial to minimize ischemic injury. Furthermore, the document on 'Problems in clinical organ preservation' mentions that current techniques for preserving donor kidneys include ice storage, which implies that cold temperatures are used. Therefore, it can be concluded that monitoring temperature during kidney allograft preservation is essential.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
