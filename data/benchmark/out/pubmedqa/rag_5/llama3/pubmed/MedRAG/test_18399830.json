["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The provided documents discuss various techniques for radical prostatectomy, including laparoscopic management of lymphocele after pelvic lymphadenectomy and radical retropubic prostatectomy. None of the documents specifically compare robotically assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy to retropubic radical prostatectomy in terms of invasiveness. However, based on the descriptions of the techniques involved, it can be inferred that robotically assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy may involve less invasive procedures than traditional retropubic radical prostatectomy, as laparoscopic surgery is often associated with smaller incisions and reduced tissue trauma.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
