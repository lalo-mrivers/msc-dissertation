["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking if single-agent mitoxantrone (not mentioned in the provided documents) is as effective as combination chemotherapy. The provided documents discuss various combination chemotherapies for metastatic breast cancer, including alkylating agents and antimetabolites with or without doxorubicin. One study found that patients receiving weekly combination therapy had a higher response rate than those receiving single-drug therapy (5-fluorouracil). Another study showed that multiple-drug chemotherapy was significantly better than single-drug therapy in terms of response rate and duration. There is no direct comparison to mitoxantrone, but the studies suggest that combination chemotherapy tends to be more effective.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
