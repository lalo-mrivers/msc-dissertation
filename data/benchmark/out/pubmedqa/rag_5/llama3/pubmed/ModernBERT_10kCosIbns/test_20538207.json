["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents provided discuss kidney preservation, including induced renal hypothermia, cold storage solutions, and the impact of prolonged cold ischemia time on graft function. One study reports on the use of a cooling jacket to prevent rewarming during transplantation, which suggests that temperature control is important in kidney preservation. Another study discusses the importance of proper temperature control during organ container usage. Given this information, it seems reasonable to monitor temperature during kidney allograft preservation.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
