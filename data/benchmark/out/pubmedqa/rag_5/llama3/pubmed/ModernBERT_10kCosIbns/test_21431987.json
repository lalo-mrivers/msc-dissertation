["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the preoperative staging of patients with liver metastases of colorectal carcinoma. PET/CT is a combined modality that uses positron emission tomography (PET) and computed tomography (CT). Based on the provided documents, it can be seen that both PET and CT have been used separately for detecting liver metastases. PET has shown high sensitivity in detecting head and neck tumors and cervical metastases, while CT has been effective in identifying liver metastases from colorectal carcinoma. The document about 99mTc-anti-CEA immunoscintigraphy suggests that IS may be useful as a supplementary method to conventional diagnostic procedures for liver metastases. However, the document comparing immunoscintigraphy and computerized tomography does not suggest that PET/CT adds anything significant to multidetector CT in terms of detecting liver metastases.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B: no\""]
