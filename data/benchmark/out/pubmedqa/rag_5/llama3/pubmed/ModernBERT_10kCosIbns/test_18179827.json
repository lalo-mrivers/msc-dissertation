["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about topical ropivacaine reducing post-tonsillectomy morbidity in pediatric patients. The provided documents are related to mepivacaine, which is a different local anesthetic. However, one document talks about alkalinization of mepivacaine for axillary block. This could be relevant if we assume that the same concept can be applied to ropivacaine as well. Another document reports on the case of local anesthetic mortality due to overdose. This is not directly related to the question. The remaining documents describe studies on mepivacaine, but they are not about pediatric patients or tonsillectomy. Therefore, based on the information provided, we cannot make a conclusion that is directly relevant to the question.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B\n}"]
