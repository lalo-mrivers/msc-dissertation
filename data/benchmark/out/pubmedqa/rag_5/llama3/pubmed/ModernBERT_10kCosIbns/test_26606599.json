["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking if surrogates of injury severity influence the occurrence of heterotopic ossification in fractures of the acetabulum. Looking at the provided documents, we can see that there are several studies and reviews that discuss heterotopic ossification as a complication of trauma and surgery. In one study, it was found that functionally significant heterotopic ossification developed in 23% of patients who did not receive adequate prophylactic irradiation or indomethacin, and this development was associated with increased time from injury to operation. This suggests that injury severity may be a factor in the occurrence of heterotopic ossification. Additionally, another study found that patients who incurred significant time delays prior to surgery were more likely to develop severe heterotopic ossification. This also supports the idea that surrogates of injury severity may influence the occurrence of heterotopic ossification.\",\n\"answer_choice\": A"]
