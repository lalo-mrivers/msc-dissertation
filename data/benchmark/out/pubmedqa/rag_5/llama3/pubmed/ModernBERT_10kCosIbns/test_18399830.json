["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents primarily discuss radical prostatectomy techniques such as retropubic prostatectomy and perineal prostatectomy. There is no mention of robotically assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy in these documents. Therefore, we cannot directly compare the invasiveness of these procedures. However, since the development of a surgeon robot for prostatectomies is discussed in one of the documents, it can be inferred that such a procedure would aim to reduce invasiveness by using robotic techniques.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
