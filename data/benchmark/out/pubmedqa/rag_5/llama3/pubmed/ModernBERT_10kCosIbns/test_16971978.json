["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks whether complex coronary lesions are more frequent in patients with diabetes mellitus. The relevant documents describe the prevalence of coronary artery disease (CAD) in diabetic patients compared to controls. According to the first document, diabetic patients had more coronary artery disease than non-diabetic patients, but no more diffuse or inoperable disease. This suggests that complex lesions may be more frequent in diabetic patients, as they have a higher overall prevalence of CAD. The second and third documents also suggest an increased risk of CAD in diabetic patients, particularly with the presence of additional cardiovascular risk factors. However, the fourth document notes that autonomic neuropathy is not increased in diabetic patients with asymptomatic CAD, which may imply that complex lesions are not necessarily more frequent.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
