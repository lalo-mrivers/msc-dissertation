["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about withdrawal-induced anxiety in alcoholism based on beta-endorphin deficiency. Plasma beta-endorphin levels were measured in chronic alcoholics at admission to the hospital and after 5 weeks of abstinence. The results showed that plasma beta-endorphin levels were half of those observed in normal controls at admission, but rose significantly after 5 weeks of abstinence and were not significantly different from those observed in normal controls. This suggests that acute alcohol consumption induces significant alterations in plasma beta-endorphin levels which are reversed after 5 weeks of abstinence. There is no evidence to suggest a deficiency of beta-endorphin in withdrawal-induced anxiety in alcoholism.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
