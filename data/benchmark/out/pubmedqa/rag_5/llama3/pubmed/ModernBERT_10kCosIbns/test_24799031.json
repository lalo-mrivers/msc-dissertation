["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks if diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) is a significant indicator of the development of vascularization in hypovascular hepatocellular lesions. According to the document 'Accelerated tumor growth and changes in images concomitant with vascularization in a patient with hepatocellular carcinoma', the ultrasonographic features of the tumor changed from a homogeneous low-echo area to a mixed low- and high-echo area with a peripheral low-echo zone, which was revealed by hepatic angiography. This suggests that imaging patterns are closely related to vascularization of the tumor. Additionally, the document 'Observation of microvascular casts of human hepatocellular carcinoma by scanning electron microscopy' shows that a vascular plexus proliferated around the HCC nodules and that the HCCs were supplied not only by the hepatic artery but also by the portal vein and hepatic sinusoids. Therefore, it is likely that DWI can be used as an indicator of the development of vascularization in hypovascular hepatocellular lesions.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
