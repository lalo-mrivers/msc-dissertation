["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks whether magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can accurately predict concordant pain provocation during provocative disc injection. From the provided documents, we see that MRI was used to visualize discs and identify specific patterns with high probability for positive or negative discograms. However, in many cases, MRI could not reliably predict or replace discography. This suggests that while MRI may be able to provide some information about disc integrity, it is not a reliable predictor of pain provocation during provocative disc injection.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B\n}"]
