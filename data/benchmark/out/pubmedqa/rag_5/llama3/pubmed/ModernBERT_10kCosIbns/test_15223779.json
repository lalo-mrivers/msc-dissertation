["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about c-Kit-dependent growth of uveal melanoma cells. The provided documents describe the expression of c-Kit protein and mRNA in normal human melanocytes, but not in most human melanoma cell lines. This suggests that c-Kit may not be involved in promoting the growth of transformed melanocytes. There is no specific information about c-Kit-dependent growth of uveal melanoma cells. Therefore, it can be concluded that c-Kit-dependent growth is unlikely to be a major factor in the growth or progression of uveal melanomas.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
