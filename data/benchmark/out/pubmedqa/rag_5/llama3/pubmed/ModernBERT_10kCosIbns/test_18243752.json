["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about chest wall irradiation after mastectomy and negative node breast cancer. From the provided documents, it's evident that postoperative irradiation is recommended for patients with positive axillary nodes or those who have a local recurrence. However, there's no specific mention of including chest wall irradiation in the treatment plan for patients with negative node breast cancer after mastectomy. Nevertheless, we can analyze some studies and trials to form an opinion.\n\nOne study (Mastectomy versus breast-conserving therapy in the treatment of stage I and II carcinoma of the breast: a randomized trial at the National Cancer Institute) found no differences in overall survival or disease-free survival between patients treated with mastectomy alone and those treated with lumpectomy plus radiation. The same study reported that the probability of failure in the irradiated breast was 12% by 5 years and 20% by 8 years.\n\nAnother study (Recurrence patterns and survival after combined radical mastectomy and postoperative irradiation: a retrospective analysis) analyzed recurrence patterns in patients treated with radical mastectomy, some of whom received postoperative irradiation. The study found that the high incidence of chest wall recurrence in patients with four or more positive nodes, and in patients with two or three positive nodes and primary lesions over 3 cm in diameter who did not receive chest wall irradiation, suggests that the maximal benefit from postoperative irradiation would not be realized without the use of chest wall irradiation in these categories of patients.\n\nBased on this analysis, it seems that including chest wall irradiation might be beneficial for certain patient subgroups, such as those with positive nodes or larger primary lesions. However, there's no conclusive evidence to support the inclusion of chest wall irradiation for all patients with negative node breast cancer after mastectomy.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
