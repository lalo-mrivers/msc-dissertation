["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the quality of life assessment tools used in studies with small cell lung cancer patients. There is no specific information provided about non-small-cell lung cancer patients. However, the EORTC Core Quality of Life Questionnaire (QLQ) and the Sickness Impact Profile (SIP) are mentioned as useful tools for assessing quality of life. The Cancer Inventory of Problem Situations (CIPS) is also used to evaluate the impact of chemotherapy on quality of life.\n\nIn the 'Improved care of patients with small cell lung cancer' document, it is stated that a comprehensive cancer care project improved the overall situation for patients treated with intensive chemotherapy with curative intent. The results show that the global score was lower in the study group than in the pre-project group (0.80 vs 1.20, p < 0.001).\n\nThe 'Quality of life during chemotherapy for small cell lung cancer' documents describe the use of generic health measures such as the SIP and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale (HAD) to assess physical and psychosocial functioning and emotional distress.\n\nThere is no direct information provided about non-small-cell lung cancer patients. However, the general conclusion from these studies is that quality of life assessment tools can be useful in evaluating the impact of treatment on patients' health-related quality of life.\",\n\n\"answer_choice\": \"B: no\""]
