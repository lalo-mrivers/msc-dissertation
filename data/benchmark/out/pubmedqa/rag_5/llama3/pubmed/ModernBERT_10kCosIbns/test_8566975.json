["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about serovar specific immunity to Neisseria gonorrhoeae. From the provided documents, it can be seen that there are different colonial types of Neisseria gonorrhoeae (Types 1 and 2). Human immunity studies suggest that sera from prostitutes have higher percentages of phagocytosis compared to sera from Catholic nuns, indicating acquired opsonic antibody to N. gonorrhoeae. However, this does not specify serovar specific immunity. The document about the effect of hyperimmunization with Neisseria gonorrhoeae on the presence of gonococcal antibody in serum, tissues, and secretions of the rabbit shows that immunization resulted in the presence of gonococcal antibodies, but it is unclear if this is serovar specific. Therefore, based on the provided information, we cannot conclude whether serovar specific immunity exists or not.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
