["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks if treatment as prevention is feasible to maintain HIV viral load suppression over time in resource-limited settings. Since the documents provide information on various aspects of HIV therapy, including antiretroviral therapy and opportunistic infections, it can be inferred that maintaining HIV viral load suppression over time requires a combination of effective antiretroviral therapy and prophylaxis against opportunistic infections. The application of azidothymidine in the latency phase and prophylaxis of pneumocystis carinii pneumonia by inhalation of pentamidin are examples of successful interventions that can delay disease progression and reduce side effects. Additionally, combining several drugs to reduce toxicity is also a viable option. Given these strategies, it appears feasible to maintain HIV viral load suppression over time in resource-limited settings.\", \"answer_choice\": A}"]
