["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents discuss the efficacy of mitoxantrone as a single agent or in combination with other chemotherapy agents. In the first document, it is mentioned that mitoxantrone was evaluated in a phase 2 study and achieved complete or partial remission in 7 out of 11 previously untreated patients and 5 out of 16 previously treated patients. This suggests that mitoxantrone has therapeutic efficacy as a single agent. In the third document, it is mentioned that mitoxantrone inhibits DNA synthesis by intercalating DNA, inducing DNA strand breaks, and causing DNA aggregation and compaction, which is similar to the mechanism of action of combination chemotherapy agents. Therefore, based on the available information, it can be concluded that first-line single-agent mitoxantrone in high-risk metastatic breast cancer patients is as effective as combination chemotherapy.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
