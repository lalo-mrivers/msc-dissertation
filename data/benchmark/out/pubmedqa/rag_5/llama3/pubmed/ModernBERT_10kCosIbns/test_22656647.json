["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents discuss preventive home visits among elderly people. The first document describes the content of these visits and how to conduct them. The second document is a study on the current position of preventive home visits in the Netherlands, but it does not provide information about acceptance rates or social imbalance. The third and fourth documents are studies about routine home visiting services and geriatric follow-up by home visits after discharge from hospital, respectively.

Therefore, based on the available information, we cannot conclude that the acceptance rate is socially imbalanced or not.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B: no\"\n}"]
