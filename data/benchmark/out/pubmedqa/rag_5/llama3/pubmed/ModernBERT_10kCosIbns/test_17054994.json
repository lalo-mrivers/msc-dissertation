["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking whether frozen section alters surgical management of multinodular thyroid disease. The relevant documents are related to the evaluation of dominant thyroid masses, accuracy of pathologic diagnosis in thyroid lesions, and clinical versus ultrasound examination of the thyroid gland. There is no direct information about multinodular thyroid disease or frozen section's impact on its surgical management. However, we can draw some conclusions from the provided information. The 'Surgery of the thyroid gland' document mentions that routine frozen section examination revealed three cases of cancer and three other cases were missed but were discovered on permanent section examination. This suggests that frozen section is not foolproof and may miss some cancers. On the other hand, the 'Accuracy of pathologic diagnosis in thyroid lesions' document states that the overall accuracy of fine-needle biopsy, frozen-section, and paraffin-section diagnoses was 81%, 87%, and 94%, respectively. This implies that frozen section is generally accurate but not perfect. The 'Clinical versus ultrasound examination of the thyroid gland' document highlights the importance of using ultrasonography to detect nodules, as clinical examination may miss some nodules. Considering these points, we can conclude that while frozen section may provide valuable information about the nature of a thyroid nodule, it is unlikely to significantly alter surgical management of multinodular thyroid disease.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B: no\"\n}"]
