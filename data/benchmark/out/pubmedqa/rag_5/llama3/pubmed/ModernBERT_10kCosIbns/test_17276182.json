["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe various aspects of atrial fibrillation (AF), including echocardiographic findings, QT and RR intervals during exercise testing, acute myocardial infarction complicated by AF, endocavitary and transesophageal electrophysiological findings in idiopathic AF, and the relation between spontaneous AF and atrial vulnerability in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White pattern.
