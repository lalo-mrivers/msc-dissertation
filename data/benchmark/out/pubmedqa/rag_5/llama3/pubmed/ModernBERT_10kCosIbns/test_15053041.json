["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about acute changes in heart rate by isoproterenol affecting aortic stiffness in patients with hypertension. We can look at the relevant documents to find the answer. From the first document, we see that isoproterenol infusion (PI) causes elevation of myocardial oxygen demand during PI and this effect persists after discontinuing PI. This suggests that acute changes in heart rate by isoproterenol may indeed affect aortic stiffness in patients with hypertension.\n\nFrom the second document, we learn that reperfusion-induced arrhythmias were exacerbated by isoproterenol (0.01-1.0 microM) in isolated rat hearts, primarily due to beta 1-receptor-mediated tachycardia. This suggests that acute changes in heart rate by isoproterenol may indeed affect aortic stiffness.\n\nFrom the third document, we see that sphygmo-Recording is a simple, noninvasive technique for analysis of pulse wave contour and timing which has been used to evaluate the change in cardiac dynamics during isoproterenol infusion. The QKd interval, i.e., the time interval between the onset of the QRS complex and the onset of the Korotkoff sound at the brachial artery when the sphygmomanometer cuff is at diastolic pressure, was found to decrease by 55, 79, and 89 msec in response to continuous intravenous infusion of isoproterenol at 0.01, 0.02, and 0.03 microgram/kg/min into 12 euthyroid normotensive adult volunteers for 10-min intervals.\n\nFinally, from the fourth document, we learn that chronic treatment with isoproterenol causes a hypertrophy of the heart (approximately 40%). Protein determination made on homogenates of the heart show similar percentages of protein in the control and treated animals. Thus, ISO presumably stimulates protein synthesis in the heart, as its total protein content is increased by chronic treatment.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the information provided, acute changes in heart rate by isoproterenol may indeed affect aortic stiffness in patients with hypertension.\",\n\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
