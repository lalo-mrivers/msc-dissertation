["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The provided documents discuss ureteral reflux, its frequency, and factors influencing it. There is no direct mention of distal ureteral diameter predicting reflux resolution after endoscopic injection. The documents focus on various aspects of ureteral reflux, such as its occurrence in patients with ileal conduit urinary diversion, its relationship to intraluminal conduit pressure, and its association with local intrarenal vasoconstrictor-vasodilator interactions. None of these topics are relevant to the question about predicting reflux resolution based on distal ureteral diameter.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
