["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks if supervised colorectal trainees differ from consultants in terms of quality of TME surgery. The relevant documents are Impact of variability among surgeons on postoperative morbidity and mortality and ultimate survival, Incorporation of laparoscopy into a surgical endoscopy training program, Can general surgeons perform colonoscopy safely?, Colorectal surgeons in district general hospitals produce similar survival outcomes to their teaching hospital colleagues: review of 5-year survivals in Manchester, and Elective versus emergency surgery for patients with colorectal cancer. Upon reviewing these documents, there is no direct evidence that suggests supervised colorectal trainees differ from consultants in terms of quality of TME surgery. The studies mentioned focus on the impact of surgeon variability on patient outcomes, the safety of colonoscopy performed by non-fellowship-trained general surgeons, and the comparison of survival outcomes between teaching and non-teaching hospitals.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
