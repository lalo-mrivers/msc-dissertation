["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Upon reviewing the relevant documents, we can see that ventricular arrhythmias were found in athletes, particularly during breathing tests and after maximal physical load. The study 'Arrhythmias in athlets (author's transl)' mentions that 88 out of 380 athletes showed arrhythmias, with most being premature beats. However, there is no mention of whether these arrhythmias subsided over time. On the other hand, the study 'Prognostic significance of long ventricular pauses in athletes' suggests that athletes with prolonged ventricular pauses did not have a different clinical risk than those without long pauses, even after 3 years of follow-up. This implies that the arrhythmias may persist over time. Therefore, we cannot conclusively say whether ventricular arrhythmias in athletes subside or not based on the provided information.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
