["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, there is no direct information that suggests arch form is influenced by sagittal molar relationship or Bolton tooth-size discrepancy. The studies focus on predicting arch length, analyzing dental arch shape, heritability of dental arch dimensions, and polynomial curve fits to human dental arches. None of these studies specifically investigate the influence of sagittal molar relationship or Bolton tooth-size discrepancy on arch form.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
