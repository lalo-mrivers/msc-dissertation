["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the bactericidal activity of antiseptic solutions in the presence of interfering substances. Considering the provided documents, it can be seen that Acisept and reference products showed no statistically significant difference in their in vivo results. This suggests that they have similar bactericidal activities. The document on 'Laboratory and in-vitro testing of skin antiseptics' mentions that MIC-MBC testing may not predict the in-vivo effect, but tests involving natural skin surfaces like the Story test offer reproducible data. There is no information provided about the specific antiseptic solutions being tested. Based on this information, it can be inferred that the NF EN 13727 European Standard might not be directly applicable to these specific antiseptics.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
