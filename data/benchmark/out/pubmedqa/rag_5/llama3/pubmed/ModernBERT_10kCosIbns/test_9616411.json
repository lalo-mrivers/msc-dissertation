["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks if general practitioner hospitals reduce the utilisation of general hospital beds. Looking at the relevant documents, we see that there is a trend towards an increase in bed occupancy rate from 77% to 83%. Additionally, the number of separations increased slightly but rates per population declined.
