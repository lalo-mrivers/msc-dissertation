["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks whether computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen is always necessary for patients with blunt trauma who are intoxicated. The documents suggest that CT scanning may be an effective screening modality in the evaluation of traumatized patients, including those with blunt abdominal trauma. In one study, 67 haemodynamically stable patients were initially managed non-operatively and 15 had normal CT examinations, only one of whom had a subsequent laparotomy for reasons unconnected to the trauma. Another study found that CT was not only highly sensitive and accurate but also an invaluable radiological diagnostic tool in the evaluation of blunt abdominal injury. However, another audit revealed many unsatisfactory examinations, suggesting that image quality can be a concern. Nevertheless, there is no clear indication that CT scanning of the abdomen is always necessary for intoxicated patients with blunt trauma.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
