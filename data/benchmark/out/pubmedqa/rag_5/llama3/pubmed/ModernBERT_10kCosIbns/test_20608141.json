["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks if PSA repeatedly fluctuating levels are reassuring enough to avoid biopsy. We can analyze the literature for similar cases. In 'Circulating prostatic-specific antigen in benign hypertrophy and localized prostate cancer: can PSA be considered a screening examination for localized cancer?' it is mentioned that a level of PSA < 15 ng/ml is an argument for a strong suspicion in favor of an adenocarcinoma of the prostate, suggesting that fluctuating levels may not be reassuring. In 'Prostate specific antigen and prostatitis' it is stated that persistently elevated PSA levels after antibiotic treatment can be indicative of prostatic cancer, implying that fluctuating levels may not rule out biopsy. Finally, in 'Efficacy of eight serially measured markers for diagnosis of prostatic carcinoma', only PSA was found to have a sufficiently high sensitivity and specificity for diagnostic purposes, suggesting that fluctuations in PSA levels may still warrant biopsy.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
