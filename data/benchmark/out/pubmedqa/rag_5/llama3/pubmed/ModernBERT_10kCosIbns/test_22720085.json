["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents provide evidence that insulin resistance is an important risk factor for both hypertension and atherosclerosis. Insulin resistance alters carbohydrate, lipid, and protein metabolism and participates directly in the development of hypertension. Elevated plasma insulin concentrations have been shown to be an independent predictor of coronary heart disease (CHD) and are related to high blood pressure, low serum HDL-cholesterol, and elevated serum triglyceride. Additionally, insulin resistance is a major determinant of plasma insulin concentration. Computer modeling studies also support the association between risk markers of CHD and model-derived measures of determinants of plasma insulin concentration. These findings collectively suggest that insulin resistance drives the association between hyperglycemia and cardiovascular risk.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
