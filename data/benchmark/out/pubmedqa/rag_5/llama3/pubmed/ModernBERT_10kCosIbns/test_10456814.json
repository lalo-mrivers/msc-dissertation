["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe the effects of desflurane on ventilation, hemodynamics, and left ventricular function. In 'Cardiovascular actions of enflurane in patients with valvular heart disease', it is mentioned that the average stroke index decreased by 27% while the average increase in heart rate (HR) of 33% compensated for this decrease. This suggests that desflurane may affect left ventricular function, but does not provide conclusive evidence. In 'Cardiovascular and respiratory actions of desflurane: is desflurane different from isoflurane?', it is mentioned that desflurane produces alterations in systemic hemodynamics that have many similarities to those produced in animals. No differences between the cardiovascular actions of desflurane and isoflurane have been identified in volunteers during spontaneous or controlled ventilation with and without nitrous oxide. In 'Cardiovascular and respiratory actions of desflurane: is desflurane different from isoflurane?', it is mentioned that left ventricular ejection fraction and velocity of fiber shortening did not change with duration of desflurane anesthesia. This suggests that desflurane may not significantly alter left ventricular function.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
