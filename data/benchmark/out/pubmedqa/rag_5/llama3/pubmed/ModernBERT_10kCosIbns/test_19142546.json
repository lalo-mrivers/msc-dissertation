["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking if there is a change in regional wall motion after resection of fibrous tissue in endomyocardial fibrosis. We need to analyze the provided documents to find relevant information. The first document describes left ventricular function and geometry with fibrous aneurysms, which is related to the topic but not directly addressing the question. The second document investigates regional left ventricular function after acute myocardial infarction, which is different from the situation described in the question. The third document discusses the measurement of left ventricular wall thickness as a measurement of ischemia, which does not provide information about fibrous tissue resection. The fourth document describes diagnostic features of constrictive endocardial fibrosis (endomyocardial fibrosis), but it does not address the change in regional wall motion after resection of fibrous tissue. The fifth document provides clinical, radiological, electrocardiographic, haemodynamic, and cineangiographic features of left ventricular endomyocardial fibrosis, which also does not directly answer the question. Therefore, based on these documents, we cannot find any information that suggests a change in quantitative left ventricular regional wall motion after fibrous tissue resection.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
