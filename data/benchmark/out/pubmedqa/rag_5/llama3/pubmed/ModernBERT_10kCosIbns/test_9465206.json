["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking whether magnetic resonance (MR) imaging can effectively replace diagnostic arthroscopy for detecting occult posttraumatic lesions of the knee. A study was performed to determine whether MR imaging is cost-effective and reduces the need for diagnostic arthroscopy. The study found that 44 patients underwent immediate arthroscopy, while 59 others did not undergo arthroscopy after having undergone MR imaging. The outcome was successful in 49 out of 55 patients who followed up at a mean of 22 months. This suggests that MR imaging can be used to diagnose and treat occult posttraumatic lesions of the knee without the need for diagnostic arthroscopy.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
