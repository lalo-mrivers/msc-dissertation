["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the relationship between estimated fetal weight by ultrasound and cesarean delivery. The provided documents discuss the use of ultrasound in prenatal care and its applications, such as calculating fetal weight.

Another document shows that the rising cesarean section rate did not contribute much to reductions in fetal and neonatal mortality. There is no direct evidence linking estimated fetal weight by ultrasound to cesarean delivery, but it seems that calculated fetal weight can be used as a predictive factor. Therefore, the answer is...\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A: yes\""]
