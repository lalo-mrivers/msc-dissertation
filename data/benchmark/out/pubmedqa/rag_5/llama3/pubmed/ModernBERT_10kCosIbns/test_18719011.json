["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking whether overweight children necessarily lead to overweight adults. Upon reviewing the documents, I see that [Overweight in children and youths--a 40-year follow-up study] found that the degree of overweight in the family and in puberty were determinants of adult weight level, with a persistent overweight rate of 35% (range, 20-60%). This suggests that childhood overweight can indeed influence adult weight. Furthermore, [Association between juvenile onset obesity and severe adult obesity in 73,532 women] found that severely obese women were 2.4 times more likely to have been fat children, emphasizing the importance of weight control in childhood. Therefore, it appears that overweight children are more likely to become overweight adults.\",\n\"answer_choice\": A"]
