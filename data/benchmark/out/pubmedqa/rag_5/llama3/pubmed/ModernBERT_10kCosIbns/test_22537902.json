["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking whether managing both colorectal cancer and synchronous liver metastases at the same centre improves results. There are no relevant documents provided that directly address this question. However, we can draw some conclusions from the given articles.\n\nArticle 1 suggests that surgical resection for liver metastases from colorectal cancer can be performed with a 'curative' aim and has a 5-year survival rate of about 30% in resectable cases. It does not mention whether management at a single centre affects these results.\n\nArticles 2 and 3 discuss the outcomes of hepatic resections for colorectal metastases and the prognostic factors that affect survival. They do not provide information on whether managing both diseases at the same centre improves results.\n\nArticle 4 describes the treatment of liver metastases from colorectal cancer with intra-arterial chemotherapy. It also does not address the question of whether management at a single centre affects outcomes.\n\nTherefore, we cannot conclude whether management at a single centre improves results or not based on the provided documents.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
