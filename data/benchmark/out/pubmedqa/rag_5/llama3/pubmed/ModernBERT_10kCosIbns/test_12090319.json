["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, we can conclude that renal cell carcinoma is a rare entity in pelvic kidneys. There is no clear rationale for this lower incidence, but it's stated that CT scans have an advantage over other imaging modalities in determining abdominal extent of tumor, including those confined to Gerota's fascia and those with contiguous spread, invading adjacent structures. Additionally, CT can detect regional lymph node metastases and tumor extension into the renal vein and inferior vena cava. Asynchronous bilateral renal cell carcinoma has a poor outcome which presumably can be improved by early diagnosis and aggressive treatment. Therefore, it seems that pelvic CT scan may not be necessary in cases of renal cell carcinoma.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
