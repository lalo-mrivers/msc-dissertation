["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"After reviewing the documents, I can see that there are several studies on triage and admission processes. The most relevant study to this question is probably 'Algorithm-directed triage in an emergency department'. This study describes a system where screeners use algorithms to triage patients into one of three treatment areas or clinics. There is no information provided about nurses being involved in the process, so it's unclear how they would compare to a simple objective score. The study doesn't provide any evidence that supports or contradicts the idea that nurses are better at predicting admission than a simple objective score.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B\n}"]
