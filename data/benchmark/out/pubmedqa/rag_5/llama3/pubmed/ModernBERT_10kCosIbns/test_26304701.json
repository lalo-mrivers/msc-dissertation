["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks if nurse-led preoperative education can reduce anxiety and postoperative complications of patients undergoing cardiac surgery. We have several documents that discuss the importance of preoperative teaching for adult surgical patients, the development and evaluation of an intervention to enhance patient education, and studies on patient knowledge and compliance after a comprehensive teaching program.
