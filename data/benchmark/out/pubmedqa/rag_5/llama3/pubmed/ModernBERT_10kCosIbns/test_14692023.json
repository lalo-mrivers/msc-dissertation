["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking whether breast cancer survival is improving. The relevant documents describe the survival rates of breast cancer patients at different time periods. In 'Survival distribution in breast cancer', it is stated that the hazard function (instantaneous death rate) decreases, which means the chance of dying from cancer decreases as a patient survives. This suggests an improvement in breast cancer survival over time. Similarly, 'Survival of breast-cancer patients with previous or subsequent neoplasms' shows that patients who have another cancer before or after developing breast cancer have a better 10-year survival rate than those with isolated breast cancer. This also implies improving breast cancer survival. In 'Is breast cancer ever cured? Follow-up study of 5623 breast cancer patients', it is stated that even for N- breast cancer, which is considered as a localized disease cured by surgery in most cases, the 5, 10, 15 and 20 year death rates from breast cancer were found to be higher than expected. This does not suggest improving breast cancer survival. Finally, 'Biology of breast cancer' mentions recent advances in breast cancer biology that may enhance our ability to predict prognosis, select therapy, and identify high-risk patients, which could contribute to improving breast cancer survival.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
