["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The study 'Coexistence of GABA and glutamate in mossy fiber terminals of the primate hippocampus: an ultrastructural study' demonstrates the presence of GABA-immunoreactivity in mossy fibre terminals that made synaptic contact with complex embedded spines of identified Golgi-impregnated CA3 pyramidal neurones. This indicates that mossy fibers release GABA.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
