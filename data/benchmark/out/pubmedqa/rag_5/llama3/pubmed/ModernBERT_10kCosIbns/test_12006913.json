["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks whether lipids, blood pressure, diabetes, and smoking confer equal risk of myocardial infarction in women as in men. We can analyze the relevant documents to answer this question.\\nFrom [Epidemiology of the coronary risk], we see that there are significant differences between men and women regarding lipids (cholesterol rate), blood pressure, and obesity. Women have a higher cholesterol rate, blood pressure, and frequency of hyperglycemia, but do not smoke as much as men.\\nFrom [Myocardial infarction in young women--clinical analysis], we see that the hospital course is typically uncomplicated, but mortality is twice as high in women compared to control group of males.\\nFrom [Risk factors for myocardial infarction in young women], we see that heavy cigarette smoking, type II hyperlipoproteinaemia, and reported treatment for pre-eclamptic toxaemia are independent risk factors for myocardial infarction in young women.\\nConsidering these findings, it appears that lipids, blood pressure, diabetes, and smoking may not confer equal risk of myocardial infarction in women as in men.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B: no\"\n}"]
