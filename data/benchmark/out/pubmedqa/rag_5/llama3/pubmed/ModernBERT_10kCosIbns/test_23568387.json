["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents provided describe various knee arthroplasty procedures, including total knee arthroplasty (TKA) and polycentric TKA. However, none of the studies specifically compare bicompartmental knee arthroplasty to TKA in terms of muscle strength or physical performance. The results are mostly focused on pain relief, range of motion, and stability. Therefore, it is not possible to determine if bicompartmental knee arthroplasty is more favourable to knee muscle strength and physical performance compared to TKA.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
