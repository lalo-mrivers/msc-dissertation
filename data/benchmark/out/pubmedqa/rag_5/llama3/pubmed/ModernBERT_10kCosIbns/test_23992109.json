["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking whether urinary biomarkers assessment is a non-invasive approach to tubular lesions of the solitary kidney. We can see from the documents that children with an acquired solitary kidney are at increased risk for proteinuria and renal insufficiency (Prognosis of children with solitary kidney after unilateral nephrectomy). This suggests that assessing urinary biomarkers may be useful in detecting tubular lesions in the solitary kidney. Furthermore, we can see that percutaneous renal biopsy is possible even in patients with a solitary kidney, which supports the idea that non-invasive approaches to evaluating the solitary kidney are feasible (Percutaneous renal biopsy of the solitary kidney: a contraindication?). Additionally, computed tomography (CT) is shown to be a valuable adjunct in investigating patients with solitary kidneys, suggesting that non-invasive imaging modalities can provide important information about the kidney's structure and function. Therefore, it seems reasonable to conclude that urinary biomarkers assessment is a non-invasive approach to tubular lesions of the solitary kidney.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
