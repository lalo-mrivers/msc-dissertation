["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, it is evident that neutrophils play a crucial role in lung defense. In adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), alveolar neutrophils show impaired function, including reduced superoxide anion production and chemotaxis. This suggests that increased neutrophil migratory activity may not be a factor in the etiology of ARDS. However, other studies suggest that hyperresponsive polymorphonuclear neutrophils with enhanced capacity to generate hydrogen peroxide may contribute to the pathogenesis of lung injury.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
