["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking whether epidural analgesia for surgical treatment of peritoneal carcinomatosis is a risky technique. We need to look at the documents provided. The first document talks about bowel obstruction caused by peritoneal carcinomatosis, and it says that surgery is not urgent and that death is usually not caused by reobstruction after surgical decompression. The second document discusses intravenous prolonged analgesia without the use of narcotic analgesics, but this is not directly related to epidural analgesia. The third document talks about locoregional immunochemotherapy of peritonitis carcinomatosa and examines the immunological response in the peritoneal cavity after administration of certain drugs. Finally, the fourth document reviews postoperative analgesia and mentions extradural analgesia as a technique that does not offer a complete solution to postoperative pain management.\n\nConsidering these documents, there is no information that suggests epidural analgesia for surgical treatment of peritoneal carcinomatosis is a risky technique.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
