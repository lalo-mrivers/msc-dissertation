["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about comparing deflation rates of prefilled textured saline breast implants with standard textured saline breast implants. We have documents related to tissue reaction to textured implant surfaces, histological features of polyurethane-coated silicone breast prostheses, xeromammography and its relation to saline-filled breast prostheses, transcutaneous extravasation of silicone following breast augmentation, and method for prevention of firm breasts from capsular contraction. None of these documents directly relate to deflation rates of textured saline breast implants. Therefore, based on the available information, we cannot conclude that there is a difference in deflation rates between prefilled and standard textured saline breast implants.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B: no\"\n}"]
