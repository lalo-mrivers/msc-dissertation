["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking whether the prognosis of polymyalgia rheumatica can be predicted at disease onset. The relevant documents describe the diagnosis of polymyalgia rheumatica, its symptoms and laboratory findings, but do not explicitly address the predictability of prognosis. However, one document mentions that patients who respond well to corticosteroids with complete suppression of disease activity may have a more favorable prognosis. Additionally, another document suggests that measurement of both erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and plasma viscosity (PV) can help assess disease activity, which could potentially influence the prognosis. Based on this information, it seems unlikely that the prognosis can be predicted with certainty at disease onset.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
