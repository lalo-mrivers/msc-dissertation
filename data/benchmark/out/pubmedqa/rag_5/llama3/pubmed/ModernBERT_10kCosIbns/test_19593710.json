["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"None of the provided documents explicitly discuss ESC (Electronic Stability Control) or its potential impact on driving behavior. The first document discusses adaptations for severely disabled individuals to drive a car, but it does not mention electronic stability control. The second document is about medical aspects of fitness to drive after anaesthetics and other drugs, which is unrelated to ESC. The third document is about the effects of automobile driving with automatic or standard transmission on physiological parameters, but it also does not discuss electronic stability control. The fourth document presents a cross-sectional analysis of motor vehicle deaths in the United States and discusses various factors influencing death rates, but again, there is no mention of ESC.\n\nTherefore, based on the provided documents, we cannot conclude that ESC will change the way we drive or not.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
