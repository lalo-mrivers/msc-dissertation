["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking if we can rely on dose-point evaluation in image-guided brachytherapy for cervical cancer. The relevant documents describe different types of radiation therapy modalities including high-dose-rate afterloading systems, low-dose-rate brachytherapy, and radical radiotherapy. Although the documents provide information on various aspects of radiation therapy, they do not specifically address dose-point evaluation in image-guided brachytherapy for cervical cancer. Therefore, we cannot conclude whether we can really rely on dose-point evaluation based on the provided information.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
