["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The provided documents describe different approaches to evaluating surgical risk, including a five-grade classification of surgical risk, statistical analysis, and predictive scores. The importance of predicting surgical risk is emphasized, particularly in general surgical practice. There is no direct evidence that risk calculators accurately predict surgical site occurrences. However, the use of predictive scores based on statistical analysis has been shown to be valid and useful tools in therapeutic programming. Therefore, it can be inferred that risk calculators may not always accurately predict surgical site occurrences.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
