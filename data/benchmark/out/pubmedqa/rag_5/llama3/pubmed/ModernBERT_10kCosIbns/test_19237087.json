["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks if many colorectal cancers are due to missed adenomas. The relevant documents discuss the development of colorectal cancer from pre-existing adenomas (adenoma-carcinoma sequence). The papers also mention that most rectal cancers developed in patients whose adenomas had been inadequately removed, and that complete removal of adenomas reduced the risk of subsequent colon cancer. Additionally, one study found that multiple adenomas with synchronous hyperplastic polyps at the initial examination predicted a higher risk of new adenomas. Based on these findings, it can be inferred that many colorectal cancers may indeed be due to missed or inadequately removed adenomas.\", \"answer_choice\": A}"]
