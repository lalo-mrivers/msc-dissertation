["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant document is 'The concomitant determination of different tumor markers in patients with epithelial ovarian cancer and benign ovarian masses: relevance for differential diagnosis.' According to this document, CA72.4 had a sensitivity of 70.7%, a specificity of 91.8%, and a diagnostic accuracy of 86.2% for epithelial ovarian cancer. It was also mentioned that CA72.4 was an antigen more frequently expressed by mucinous malignancies. Since endometriomas are benign and non-mucinous, it is unlikely that CA72-4 would be a useful biomarker in differential diagnosis between ovarian endometrioma and epithelial ovarian cancer.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
