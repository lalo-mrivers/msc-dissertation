["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks if the severity of obstructive sleep apnea predicts patients requiring high continuous positive airway pressure. The relevant documents describe the effectiveness of CPAP therapy for obstructive sleep apnea and its beneficial effects on breathing during sleep, prevention of nocturnal desaturations, and improvement in diurnal oxygenation. There is no direct information on the relationship between severity of obstructive sleep apnea and requirement for high CPAP pressure. However, the documents suggest that CPAP is a treatment of choice for most cases of obstructive sleep apnea, and that good compliance and rapid improvement of symptomatology are facilitated by application of positive airway pressure (CPAP) at the nose.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
