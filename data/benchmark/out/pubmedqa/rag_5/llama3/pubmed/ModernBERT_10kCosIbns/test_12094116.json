["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents provided information on mechanical work and efficiency in level walking and running, maximal and submaximal exercise in different positions, muscular efficiency during steady-rate exercise, and muscle power predicts freestyle swimming performance. However, none of the documents explicitly discussed the relationship between muscle power and running speed with changes of direction. Therefore, we cannot determine whether muscle power is related to running speed with changes of direction.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
