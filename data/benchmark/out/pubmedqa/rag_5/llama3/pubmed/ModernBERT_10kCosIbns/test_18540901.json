["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The provided documents discuss transient tachypnea of the newborn (TTN) as a condition characterized by persistence of fetal cardiopulmonary circulation, hyperinflation of lungs, and hypoxemia. The first document suggests that this may be caused by an increase in pulmonary vascular resistance due to lung hyperinflation, which reopens fetal cardiopulmonary circulatory channels. The second document shows an association between low noradrenaline levels at birth and the development of TTN. There is no mention of polymorphisms in the beta-adrenergic receptor (ADRB) encoding genes or any genetic component to TTN.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
