["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks whether schizophrenia patients with high intelligence can be considered a clinically distinct subtype of schizophrenia. From the provided documents, we can see that intellectual deficits are common in schizophrenia, but there is evidence to suggest that some patients may have better preserved premorbid ability. For example, the study 'Estimation of premorbid intelligence in schizophrenia' found that NART-estimated IQ did not differ significantly between community-resident schizophrenics and their controls, suggesting that some patients may have high intelligence. Similarly, the study 'Intellectual deficits in first-episode schizophrenia: evidence for progressive deterioration' found that although both groups showed few differences on tests to estimate premorbid intellectual ability, the chronic group performed worse on measures considered sensitive to deterioration. This suggests that there may be a subgroup of patients with better preserved cognitive function. However, without further investigation, it is difficult to say whether these patients constitute a clinically distinct subtype.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
