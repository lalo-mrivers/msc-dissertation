["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks whether confined placental mosaicism accounts for adverse perinatal outcomes in IVF pregnancies. The provided documents suggest that confined placental mosaicism is associated with increased frequency of second and third trimester pregnancy loss or intrauterine fetal growth retardation (Spontaneous abortion and confined chromosomal mosaicism). Moreover, studies have shown a significantly higher rate of prenatal loss (22 per cent) as well as the presence of intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) has been reported among pregnancies with CPM. Confirmation of CVS mosaicism in term placentae and high frequency of intrauterine growth retardation association with confined placental mosaicism also supports this notion. Follow-up studies have shown an association between placental mosaicism and fetal loss, and one study even found that the proportion of aneuploid cells in the mosaic term placentae correlated with that observed in CVS specimens. Therefore, it can be concluded that confined placental mosaicism is associated with adverse perinatal outcomes.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A: yes\"\n}"]
