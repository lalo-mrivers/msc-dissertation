["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks if oxybutynin hydrochloride causes arrhythmia in children with bladder dysfunction. Let's look at the provided documents. In 'Oxybutynin influence on autonomic measures in dogs', we see that oxybutynin produces a dose-related tachycardia (increased heart rate) in conscious dogs, and under pentobarbital anesthesia, it causes systolic and diastolic hypotension. This suggests that oxybutynin has some cardiovascular activity, but no arrhythmia is mentioned specifically. In 'The pharmacokinetics of intravesical and oral oxybutynin chloride', we don't see any mention of arrhythmia either. In the other documents, there's no relevant information about arrhythmia. Based on this, it seems that oxybutynin hydrochloride does not cause arrhythmia in children with bladder dysfunction.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
