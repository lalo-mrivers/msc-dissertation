["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks whether reducing spasticity translates into functional benefit. Spasticity is characterized by an increase in muscle tone, which can lead to disability depending on the site and extent of the lesion (Spasticity--implications in rehabilitation). The pathophysiological mechanisms underlying this spastic muscle tone remain obscure (Trends in the pathophysiology and pharmacotherapy of spasticity), but it is clear that reducing spasticity is a goal of treatment. The effects of reducing spasticity on functional benefit are discussed in Spasticity: its physiology and management. Part IV, which proposes that recent discoveries about the 'recovery' capabilities of the central nervous system may influence the means for managing spasticity in the future.\n\nRecent experiments have confirmed the classical view that the spastic muscle tone is related to the EMG activity evoked in the passively stretched muscle (Trends in the pathophysiology and pharmacotherapy of spasticity). This suggests that reducing spasticity through various treatment procedures, including physical, surgical, or pharmacological ones, may lead to functional benefit.\n\nManagement strategies in the rehabilitation of patients with spasticity aim at preserving maximum possible function in mobility and activities of daily living (Spasticity--implications in rehabilitation), which further supports the idea that reducing spasticity can translate into functional benefit.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
