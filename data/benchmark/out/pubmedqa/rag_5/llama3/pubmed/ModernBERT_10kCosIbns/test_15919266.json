["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks if adjuvant radiation is necessary for stage III thymoma. We can look at the literature for answers. The first document discusses radiation therapy control of nine patients with malignant thymoma. It says that local tumor control has been 100% with an average follow-up being 5.5 years and a minimum of 30 months. This suggests that adjuvant radiation may be necessary to achieve local tumor control. In the second document, it is mentioned that radiotherapy associated or not to an incomplete surgical resection yielded 3 cases of 5-year survival for invasive thymomas out of 5 patients with this follow-up. This also supports the idea that adjuvant radiation may be necessary. The third document discusses post-operative radiotherapy in invasive thymoma and mentions that treatment was generally well tolerated but three patients (11%) developed significant side effects from the radiotherapy and two of these died. This suggests that there are some risks associated with adjuvant radiation, but it still appears to be effective. Finally, the fourth document discusses neoadjuvant chemotherapy, surgery, and postoperative radiation therapy for invasive thymoma and mentions that all patients showed a partial response (greater than 50%) and underwent complete or incomplete surgical resection. This further supports the idea that adjuvant radiation may be necessary to achieve local tumor control.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
