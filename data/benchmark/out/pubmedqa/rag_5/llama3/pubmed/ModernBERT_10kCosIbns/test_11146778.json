However, the associations were weak with r2 values ranging from .03 to a maximum of .22 for Pearson's correlation coefficients. This suggests that the APACHE II score may be useful for retrospective analyses of large cohorts of patients but should not be used as a triage tool or as a predictor of outcome for the individual patient.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
