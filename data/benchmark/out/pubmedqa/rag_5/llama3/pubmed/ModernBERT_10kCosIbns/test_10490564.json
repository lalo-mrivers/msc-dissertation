["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks whether profound hypotensive events can cause myocardial ischaemic events. Looking at the provided documents, I see that there are studies on coronary hypotension and its effects on myocardial substrate utilization. In one study, prolonged severe hypotension caused a relative preference of FFA oxidation and diminished lactate and glucose uptakes by the myocardium. This suggests that hypotension can affect myocardial substrate utilization. Another study showed that transient defects in perfusion without clearance abnormalities were observed during silent ischemia in patients with essential hypertension. This further supports the idea that hypotension can cause myocardial ischaemic events.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
