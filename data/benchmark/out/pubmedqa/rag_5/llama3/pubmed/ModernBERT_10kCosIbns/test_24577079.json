["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The provided documents suggest that age-related differences in working memory can be attenuated by controlling for processing speed (Influence of processing speed on adult age differences in working memory). Additionally, research has shown that cognitive restructuring and self-generated strategies can improve memory performance and beliefs about control (Improving memory and control beliefs through cognitive restructuring and self-generated strategies), which may influence age-related deficits. Furthermore, older adults tend to exhibit reduced ability to transform or abstract information (Within-context assessment of age differences in working memory). However, mnemonic training has been shown to be effective in improving episodic memory tasks for the elderly (Improving memory performance in the aged through mnemonic training: a meta-analytic study), which may mitigate age-related deficits. Therefore, it can be concluded that strategy training can reduce age-related deficits in working memory.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
