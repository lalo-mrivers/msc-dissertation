["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe different situations where venous air embolism (VAE) can occur, such as during neurosurgical operations, lung surgery, and liver surgery. One study reported a high incidence of VAE during neurosurgical operations performed in the sitting position. Another study examined the effect of anesthesia type on VAE during single-lung ventilation. The only document that specifically mentions liver surgery is the last one, which discusses the creation of nonsurgical portosystemic venous shunts in dogs using a transjugular approach. However, this does not provide information about patient position and VAE risk. Therefore, it cannot be determined from these documents whether patient position during liver surgery influences the risk of venous air embolism.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
