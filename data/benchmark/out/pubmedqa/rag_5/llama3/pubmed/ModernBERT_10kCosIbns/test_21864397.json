["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the survival of nasopharyngeal carcinoma with lung metastasis alone. The relevant documents provided are studies on distant metastases in nasopharyngeal carcinoma, cytologic features of 18 cases of metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma, chemotherapy for recurrent or metastatic carcinoma of the nasopharynx, stage classification of nasopharyngeal carcinoma, and a histopathological study of lymphoid tissue reaction to metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma in nude mice.
