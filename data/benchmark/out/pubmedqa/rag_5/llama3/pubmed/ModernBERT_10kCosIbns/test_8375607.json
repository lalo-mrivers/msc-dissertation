["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about whether breastfeeding is best for children with a family history of atopy. We can look at the documents provided to see if there's any information that supports or refutes this claim. One document discusses the risk of infantile atopic dermatitis posed by maternal and paternal atopy, respectively. It finds that maternal atopy poses a higher risk for infantile atopic dermatitis than paternal atopy. This suggests that there may be a genetic component to atopy, which could influence the effectiveness of breastfeeding in preventing or reducing symptoms. Another document discusses the prevalence of atopy in a population with neoplastic disease and compares it to an age-matched control group. The results show a 15-fold decrease in prevalence of atopy in the cancer population compared to the control group and published estimates of atopy in the general population. This could suggest that there is some factor, possibly breastfeeding, that contributes to this lower prevalence of atopy. However, there is no direct evidence in the documents provided that suggests breastfeeding is best for children with a family history of atopy.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
