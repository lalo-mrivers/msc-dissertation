["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about laparoscopic reoperation for failed antireflux surgery. The provided documents mention various antireflux operations and their success rates, but they don't specifically discuss laparoscopic reoperation for failed antireflux surgery. However, the 'Sequelae of antireflux surgery in profoundly disabled children' document mentions that 25% of children required reoperation due to recurrent gastroesophageal reflux or mechanical problems with the fundoplication after initial antireflux operation. Although it doesn't explicitly mention laparoscopic reoperation, it implies that some form of reoperation may be necessary. Therefore, considering this information and the fact that minimally invasive procedures are mentioned in one of the documents, I think step-by-step thinking suggests a possible 'yes' answer.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
