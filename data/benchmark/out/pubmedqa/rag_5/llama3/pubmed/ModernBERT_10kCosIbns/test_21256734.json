["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks whether pain intensity predicts a poor opioid response in cancer patients. The relevant document is 'Opioid sensitivity of chronic pain: a patient-controlled analgesia method'. This study found that some pains judged to be neuropathic had a good response to opioid, and some pains judged to be nociceptive did not. The study suggests that the pattern of response is not as black and white as the prediction of good response from nociceptive pain and poor from neuropathic pain would suggest. No reliable predictor of opioid requirement was identified in 'Pain, opioid use, and survival in hospitalized patients with advanced cancer'. Therefore, based on these studies, it appears that pain intensity does not predict a poor opioid response in cancer patients.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
