["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about Kenya, but none of the provided documents mention Kenya. However, they do discuss universal coverage and health care systems in general. The principles of universal coverage are mentioned in the 'Principles of justice as a basis for conceptualizing a health care system' paper, which states that justice in health care requires striving for equality in access to basic health care. This implies that universal coverage is important.\n\nThe 'Deciding on access and levels of care: a comparison of Canada, Britain, Germany, and the United States' paper also discusses universal coverage plans in different countries, but does not specifically mention Kenya.\n\nThe other papers do not provide direct answers to this question.\n\nTherefore, based on the provided documents, it is difficult to determine whether the distribution of health care benefits in Kenya meets the principles of universal coverage. However, we can infer that universal coverage is an important principle for a just health care system.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B: no\"\n}"]
