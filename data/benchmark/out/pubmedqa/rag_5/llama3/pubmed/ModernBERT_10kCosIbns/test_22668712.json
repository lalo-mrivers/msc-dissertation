["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking if there's still a place for ultrasound in diagnosing internal derangement of the temporomandibular joint. The provided documents discuss various imaging modalities such as ultrasonography, arthrotomography, electrovibratography, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Ultrasonography has been shown to provide images of the TMJ that are at right angles to those produced by arthrotomography, which suggests it can be a useful tool. However, the study also mentions that the present images are not ideal for clinical use, but higher resolution ultrasound equipment might provide non-invasive diagnosis. This information leads me to conclude that ultrasound still has a place in diagnosing internal derangement of the temporomandibular joint.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
