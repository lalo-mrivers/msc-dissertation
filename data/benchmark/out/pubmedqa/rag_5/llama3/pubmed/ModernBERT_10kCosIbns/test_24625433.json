["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about comparing noise levels of high flow nasal cannulae with bubble CPAP for preterm infants. The provided documents describe various applications of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) using different systems, including bilateral nasal cannulation, a modified apparatus for nasal application of CPAP to newborns, and a system based on a nasal vestibular cannula and a miniature gas jet. None of these documents mention high flow nasal cannulae or bubble CPAP specifically. Therefore, it is not possible to directly compare the noise levels of these two types of systems based on the provided information.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C: maybe\"\n}"]
