["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking whether sternal skin conductance can be used as a reasonable surrogate for hot flash measurement. The relevant documents provide information on skin temperature measurements, but they don't directly address sternal skin conductance or its relationship to hot flashes. However, one of the documents (Investigation of hot flashes by ambulatory monitoring) mentions toe temperatures and their relationship to perceived hot flashes. This suggests that skin temperature measurements may be related to hot flash perception. Therefore, based on this indirect evidence, it can be inferred that sternal skin conductance might be a reasonable surrogate for hot flash measurement.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A: yes\""]
