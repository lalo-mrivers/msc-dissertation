["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe fine-needle aspiration cytopathology in breast disease. The study 'Cytologic differentiation between proliferative and nonproliferative breast disease in mammographically guided fine-needle aspirates' proposes a cytologic grading system to further characterize benign breast lesions. According to this system, nonproliferative disease is diagnosed with a total score ranging from 6 to 10, while proliferative disease without atypia is diagnosed with a total score ranging from 11 to 14. Since the scores are distinct, it is possible to distinguish between nonproliferative breast disease and proliferative breast disease without atypia by fine-needle aspiration cytology.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
