["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about rectal anastomosis in gynaecological debulking surgery without a diverting stoma. The posterior approach to rectal anastomoses document suggests that the procedure provides excellent exposure for benign lesions, and as an adjunct to low anterior resection, it broadens the scope of the procedure. This implies that rectal anastomosis can be performed safely in gynaecological debulking surgery without a diverting stoma. Additionally, vaginoplasty was used in a consecutive series of 45 patients undergoing rectal excision for neoplastic and inflammatory bowel disease, and none developed a persistent perineal fistula or other complications. The results suggest that rectal anastomosis can be performed safely without a diverting stoma.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
