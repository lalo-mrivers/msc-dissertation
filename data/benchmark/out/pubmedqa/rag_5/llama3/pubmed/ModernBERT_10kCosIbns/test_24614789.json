["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents discuss lumbar drainage of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in various contexts. Continuous lumbar drainage was used to help the healing of CSF leaks and reduce the need for surgery in patients with traumatic or postoperative CSF fistulas. The document 'Postoperative cerebrospinal-fluid fistula associated with erosion of the dura' recommends using autogenous muscle or fascial dural patches, immediate lumbar subarachnoid shunting, and modification of the usual postoperative regimen when the dura is found to be absent adjacent to an ossified portion of the posterior longitudinal ligament in the cervical spine. The document 'Complications of lumbar spinal fluid drainage' reports minor complications such as headache, nausea, vomiting, etc., in 59% of patients and major complications including unilateral occlusion of the posterior cerebral artery and unilateral true vocal cord paralysis in four out of 32 patients (12.5%). These findings demonstrate the possibility of potentially serious complications that mandate close monitoring of patients who require continuous lumbar drainage.\",\n\"answer_choice\": A"]
