["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking if vancomycin MIC creep is a worldwide phenomenon. The relevant documents discuss vancomycin resistance in Enterococcus species, selection of resistance to vancomycin in Staphylococcus haemolyticus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, the activity of vancomycin against recently isolated nosocomial gram-positive cocci, new vancomycin disk diffusion breakpoints for enterococci, and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus corneal ulcers. None of these documents explicitly state that vancomycin MIC creep is a worldwide phenomenon. However, it can be inferred that vancomycin resistance is a global issue based on the reports of resistant isolates from North America and Europe. Therefore, we cannot definitively say that vancomycin MIC creep is not a worldwide phenomenon, but rather, it seems to be.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"]
