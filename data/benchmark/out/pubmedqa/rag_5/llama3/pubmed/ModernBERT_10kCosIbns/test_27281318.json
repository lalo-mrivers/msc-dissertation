["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about creating adequate femoral tunnel lengths at 90° of knee flexion in anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using flexible instruments. The provided documents are about various aspects of ACL reconstructions, including graft impingement, operative lengthening of the femur, and isometric placement for extraarticular reconstructions. None of these documents directly address the question of creating adequate femoral tunnel lengths at 90° of knee flexion using flexible instruments. Therefore, we must rely on general principles and indirect inferences to answer the question.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
