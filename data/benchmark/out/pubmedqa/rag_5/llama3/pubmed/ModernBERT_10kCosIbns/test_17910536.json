["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"There is no direct evidence related to adults with mild intellectual disabilities. However, we can consider the concept of self-judged comprehension in adults as mentioned in 'Self-judged comprehension in adults: effects of age and skill'. This study suggests that older readers tend to lower their comprehension judgments for problematic text, whereas younger readers, regardless of skill level, tended to overestimate their comprehension. Additionally, we can consider the information-processing analysis presented in 'Reading disability: an information-processing analysis', which highlights memory skills deficiencies in children with reading disabilities. This might be related to adults with mild intellectual disabilities who may have similar difficulties with processing information.\n\nConsidering these points, it is possible that the reading comprehension ability of adults with mild intellectual disabilities can be improved through targeted instruction and training, but this would require further research and investigation.\n\nGiven the lack of direct evidence, we cannot definitively say whether it's 'yes', 'no', or 'maybe'. However, based on the provided information, it is reasonable to suggest that there might be room for improvement in reading comprehension ability with proper instruction and support.\", \n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
