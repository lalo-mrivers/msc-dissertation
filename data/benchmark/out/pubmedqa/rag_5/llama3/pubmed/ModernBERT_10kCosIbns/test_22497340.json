["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking if the horizontal semicircular canal ocular reflex is influenced by otolith organs input. The relevant documents describe the plasticity of the human otolith-ocular reflex and the detection of rotating gravity signals. The study on off-vertical axis rotation shows that otolith-induced responses can be obtained during constant velocity OVAR using a tilt of 30 degrees, suggesting that otolith organs are involved in producing eye movements. However, the study does not specifically investigate the influence of otolith organs input on horizontal semicircular canal ocular reflex.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A: yes\"\n}"]
