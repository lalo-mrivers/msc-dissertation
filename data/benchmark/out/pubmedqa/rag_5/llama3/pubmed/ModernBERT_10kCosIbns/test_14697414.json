["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking if there is a subset of patients with prostate cancer who develop oligometastases. Upon reviewing the relevant documents, we see that hematogenous micrometastasis was detected in 4 out of 12 prostate cancer patients with stage D0-3 prostatic adenocarcinoma. This suggests that some patients may develop oligometastases.
