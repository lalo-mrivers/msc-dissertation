["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about measuring mesopic pupil size with cobalt blue light slit-lamp biomicroscopy method. We have to look for relevant information in the provided documents that can help us answer this question. After reviewing the documents, we find that one of them describes a photostimulator and an infrared videopupillograph, which gives a direct and continuous measure of the area of the pupil. This suggests that it is possible to measure pupil size using this method. However, there is no specific information about cobalt blue light slit-lamp biomicroscopy in the provided documents. Therefore, we have to consider the general principles and limitations of measuring pupil size. The photostimulator described in one of the documents can provide quantitative variable light output, which can be used for measuring pupil size. This suggests that it is possible to measure mesopic pupil size with the cobalt blue light slit-lamp biomicroscopy method.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
