["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, we can see that there are mixed findings regarding the relationship between family history of problem drinking and subsequent drinking patterns in young adulthood. The first document shows that among problem drinkers, those with a positive family history were more severely affected than those without, suggesting some persistence of familial transmission into young adulthood. However, the second document contradicts this finding, stating that parental loss was not an antecedent to heavy drinking in young adults. This suggests that the relationship between family disruption and subsequent drinking patterns is complex and may depend on various factors such as social class or timing of the disruption.
