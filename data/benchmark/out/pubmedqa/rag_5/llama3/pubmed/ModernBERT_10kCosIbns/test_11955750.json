["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents discuss the use of beta applicators with 106Ru/106Rh for treating posterior choroidal melanomas. The effects of irradiation therapy are mentioned as being less important compared to cobalt-60 applicators. There is no direct information on the escalation of apical dose, but there is a study on the clinical trials of chemical radiosensitization and another one on the biologic detection of reduction in dose at the surface of volume sources containing beta emitters. These studies do not suggest any correlation between the apical dose and treatment outcome. Therefore, it can be inferred that escalation of the apical dose may not significantly change treatment outcome.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
