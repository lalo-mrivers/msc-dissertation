["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking if lower fasting plasma glucose levels at diagnosis of type 2 diabetes are associated with improved outcomes. In the provided documents, we see that lower fasting blood sugar levels (<110 mg/dl) at initial diagnostic test are associated with a higher percentage (41%) showing further deterioration of carbohydrate control over the first 13 years of study compared to those with higher fasting blood sugar levels (â‰¥110 mg/dl). This suggests that lower glucose levels may be associated with worsened outcomes. Additionally, we see that worsening to diabetes in men with impaired glucose tolerance is not significantly influenced by treatment, which further supports the idea that lower glucose levels may be linked to poorer outcomes.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
