["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking whether routine chest radiography after transbronchial biopsy is necessary. The diagnostic yield of transbronchoscopic biopsies indicates that the procedure's diagnostic yield was low, especially for diagnosing infections. Clinical implications of a 'nonspecific' transbronchial biopsy suggest that open lung biopsy may be the procedure of choice when infection is suspected. Chest radiography for general practitioners suggests that abnormal radiographs are rare in the 10-29 year age group and often have clinically related abnormalities. The recognition of lesions on chest radiographs provides an approach to recognizing lesions, but does not specifically address routine chest radiography after transbronchial biopsy. Evaluation of unguided transbronchial biopsy in the diagnosis of pulmonary disease indicates that the procedure is safe and efficacious for establishing a pathological diagnosis, suggesting that routine chest radiography may not be necessary.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B\n}"]
