["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the learning needs of postpartum women, specifically whether socioeconomic status (SES) matters. The provided documents discuss breastfeeding support, nursing input, predictors of health in new mothers, and maternal concerns during the early postpartum period.
