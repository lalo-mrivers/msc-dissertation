["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the lifetime prevalence of impetigo, molluscum, and herpes infections in children with atopic dermatitis. The provided documents mention that children with atopic dermatitis who suffer recurrent or persistent infections should undergo immunologic evaluation. This suggests that there may be an increased risk of infection in these individuals. Additionally, the document 'Patch testing, tuberculin testing and sensitization with dinitrochlorobenzene and nitrosodimethylanilini of patients with atopic dermatitis' mentions disturbances in the cell-mediated immune system in patients with atopic dermatitis, which could contribute to an increased risk of infection.
