["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is whether primary angioplasty is an acceptable alternative to thrombolysis. From the provided documents, it can be seen that after failure of thrombolysis, some patients underwent angioplasty with good results (92.5% reperfusion rate). The TAMI trials also showed similar outcomes for both thrombolytic therapy and rescue angioplasty. Additionally, the article on percutaneous intraarterial thrombolysis in the treatment of thrombosis of lower extremity arterial reconstructions mentions that grafts can be salvaged with thrombolytic therapy as an alternative to balloon catheter thrombectomy, implying that primary angioplasty could be a viable option. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that primary angioplasty is an acceptable alternative to thrombolysis.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
