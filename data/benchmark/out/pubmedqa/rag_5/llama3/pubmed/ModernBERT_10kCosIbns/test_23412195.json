["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe different types of fractures and their treatments. The first document discusses lateral clavicular fractures, where conservative treatment was performed for cases without dislocation. Operation was necessary if there was a rupture of the coracoclavicular ligament and dislocation of the distal clavicular end. No pseudarthrosis was seen in X-rays, mobility of the shoulder girdle was good, and symptoms of pain were rare. This suggests that displaced midshaft clavicular fractures can be treated conservatively without surgery. The second document describes a case of simultaneous dislocation-fracture of both ends of the clavicle, where operative reduction was necessary. However, this is an unusual scenario. The other documents discuss different types of fractures in various parts of the body, but do not provide specific information on midshaft clavicular fractures. Therefore, based on the available information, it seems that displaced midshaft clavicular fractures can be treated conservatively.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
