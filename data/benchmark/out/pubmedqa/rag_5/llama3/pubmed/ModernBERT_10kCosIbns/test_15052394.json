["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking whether higher rates of depression in women are due to differential symptom reporting. Based on the documents provided, we can see that there are mixed findings regarding sex differences in depressive symptoms and syndromes. The Zurich Study suggests that women report a greater number of symptoms for identical syndromes than men, but when syndromes or diagnoses were controlled, women and men suffered equally from subjective impairment at work. This could be seen as evidence against differential symptom reporting being the sole cause of higher rates of depression in women. Additionally, the Is sex necessarily a risk factor to depression? study found no significant sex differences in depressive episodes, suggesting that social factors may be more important than biological or psychological factors. Therefore, it is possible that other factors beyond differential symptom reporting contribute to higher rates of depression in women.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
