["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents suggest that larger animals have relatively smaller kidneys and survive longer than smaller animals. This implies that the whole animal response varies between species, with larger animals being more resilient to ischemic damage. Additionally, hypothermia has been shown to protect the kidney from damage caused by normo-thermic ischemia. In the experiment on 133 dogs resecting the single kidney under local hypothermia to 15 degrees C, acute renal insufficiency was prevented and compensatory-restorative processes in the kidney could develop successfully. This suggests that a solitary kidney can be more resistant to ischemia.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
