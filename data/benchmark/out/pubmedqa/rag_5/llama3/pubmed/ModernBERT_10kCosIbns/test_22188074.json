["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, particularly the second one 'Instrumental activities of daily living as a screening tool for cognitive impairment and dementia in elderly community dwellers', we can see that instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) are correlated with cognitive impairment independent of age, sex, and education. Additionally, the IADL score has been shown to have a sensitivity of 0.94 and specificity of 0.71 for diagnosing dementia. This suggests that IADL may be a useful predictor of dementia.

These findings support the idea that IADL can predict dementia.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
