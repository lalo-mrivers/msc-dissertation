The first document mentions environmentally triggered small vessel vasculitis, which suggests that environmental factors may be relevant. The second document discusses a rational model for comparing vulnerability to environmental health risks, implying that environmental factors can impact disease patterns. The third document talks about climate and air pollution, which is also related to environmental health risks. Finally, the fourth document shows a study on cancer mortality in regions with different environmental conditions, which further supports the idea that environmental factors are important.
