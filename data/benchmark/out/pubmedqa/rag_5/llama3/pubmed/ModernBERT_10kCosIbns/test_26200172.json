["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Several studies were reviewed, including one on noncontingent positive and negative feedback during maximal exercise, which found that although there were no significant effects on performance for the various feedback conditions, subjects judged the positive feedback favourably and as accurate. Another study looked at the effect of antecedent muscle tension levels on motor behavior, finding that high levels of pre-competition muscle tension occurring in athletes are capable of disrupting performance. The use of biofeedback relaxation techniques in the pre-competition period may significantly improve the performance of competitive athletes hampered by particularly high levels of pre-competition muscle tension. Additionally, a study on developing strategies for biofeedback applications in neurologically handicapped patients provides information on positioning of the limbs, initiating contractions, and controlling spasticity. Finally, a study comparing the effectiveness of biofeedback training with standard rehabilitation technique found that the increase in both strength and range of motion was approximately twice as great in the group receiving biofeedback training. Overall, these studies suggest that biofeedback training can enhance athletes' sport performance.\",\n\"answer_choice\": A"]
