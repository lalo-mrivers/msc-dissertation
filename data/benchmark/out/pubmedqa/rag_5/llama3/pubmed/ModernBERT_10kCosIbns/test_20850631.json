["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about diagnosis and follow-up in constipated children. The relevant documents provide information on prenatal diagnosis of urinary tract obstructions and imaging the urinary tract. Since the discussion is about constipation in children, it's unlikely that ultrasound would be used to diagnose urinary tract obstruction. Instead, rectoanal pressures and rectal sensitivity studies are more relevant for understanding constipation. Rectoanal pressures and rectal sensitivity studies were performed in 32 control children and 144 chronically constipated children. The study found abnormalities at manometry in most cases of chronic constipation. Therefore, ultrasound is not likely to be used for diagnosis and follow-up in constipated children.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B: no\""]
