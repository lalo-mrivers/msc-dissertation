["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe various methods of measuring adipose tissue distribution, including visceral adipose tissue (VAT) area measurement using computed tomography (CT). The study on 'Quantification of adipose tissue by MRI' mentions that VAT volume was determined using a linear interpolation of VAT areas obtained on consecutive slices. This suggests that VAT area measurement can be used to estimate VAT volume, at least for a specific level or slice.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
