["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, we know that premature excision biopsy of a cervical lymph node infiltrated by metastatic carcinoma may compromise patient survival since it is associated with an increased incidence of local wound recurrence and distant metastases. Furthermore, radical neck dissection was recommended as the salvage procedure for patients with persistent or recurrent cervical metastasis developed after radiotherapy. Additionally, we know that histopathological examination can detect more tumor-harboring lymph nodes compared to clinical examination, which suggests that histopathological methods have a real prognostic value in evaluating the metastatic lymph nodes in head and neck cancer. Considering these points, it is crucial to carefully evaluate the patient's condition before deciding on whether to perform a neck dissection.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
