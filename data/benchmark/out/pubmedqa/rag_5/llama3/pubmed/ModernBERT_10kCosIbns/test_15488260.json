["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking whether the type of remission after a major depressive episode is an important risk factor to relapses in a 4-year follow up. To answer this, we need to look at the relevant documents that discuss recurrent depressive disorders and patterns of recurrence. Specifically, Pattern of recurrence of illness after recovery from an episode of major depression: a prospective study suggests that the probability of remaining well after recovery from the index episode was 76% at 6 months, 63% at 1 year, and 25% at 5 years. Moreover, the study found that the risk of recurrence was lower among patients receiving prophylactic treatment with antidepressants and/or lithium and among those with histories of fewer than three previous episodes.\n\nRecovery and major depression: factors associated with twelve-month outcome also suggests that recovery status at 12 months after hospital discharge is an important factor in predicting relapse. Specifically, the study found that patients who had recovered by 12 months had done so within 6 months of discharge; the average length of time to recovery was 4.9 months.\n\nTime to recovery, chronicity, and levels of psychopathology in major depression: A 5-year prospective follow-up of 431 subjects suggests that instantaneous probabilities of recovery reflect that the longer a patient was ill, the lower his or her chances were of recovering. This implies that the type of remission after a major depressive episode may be an important risk factor for relapses.\n\nTherefore, based on these studies, I conclude that...\", \n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
