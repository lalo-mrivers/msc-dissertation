["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the prognosis of well-differentiated small hepatocellular carcinoma. We can look at the relevant documents to find the answer. In the first document 'Solitary minute hepatocellular carcinoma', it is mentioned that there were no operative deaths or hospital deaths in this series, and the 5-year survival rate after resection was 100%. This suggests that well-differentiated small hepatocellular carcinoma has a good prognosis.\n\nIn the second document 'Diagnostic aspects and follow-up of 174 cases of hepatocellular carcinoma', it is mentioned that only 14 patients could be referred to surgery, which significantly improved prognosis. However, this does not specifically mention well-differentiated small hepatocellular carcinoma.\n\nThe third document 'Clinical profile: prognostic index in hepatocellular carcinoma' mentions the survival rate for different age groups and also mentions that serum bilirubin above 5 mg/dl with HCC had poor prognosis. It does not specifically mention well-differentiated small hepatocellular carcinoma.\n\nThe fourth document 'Sixty cases of primary hepatocellular carcinoma in one year' mentions that the majority of patients died within 15 months, which suggests a poor prognosis for hepatocellular carcinoma as a whole.\n\nThe fifth document 'Hepatocellular carcinoma: a clinical study' mentions that only 10% of patients were alive six months after admission to the hospital. This also suggests a poor prognosis for hepatocellular carcinoma.\n\nBased on these documents, it seems that well-differentiated small hepatocellular carcinoma has a good prognosis.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
