["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about thrombosis prophylaxis in hospitalised medical patients. The provided documents are related to various types of surgery and prophylactic measures. However, there is no specific information on medical patients. But we can look at the document [Prevention of postoperative thromboembolism in Denmark] which states that 92% of departments used thrombosis prophylaxis (TP) routinely, except for otological and odontological departments. This suggests that prophylaxis is commonly practiced. The document [Thromboembolism] emphasizes the importance of prophylaxis, especially in high-risk situations. There is no information to contradict this approach. Therefore, it seems reasonable to apply thrombosis prophylaxis in all hospitalised medical patients.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A: yes\""]
