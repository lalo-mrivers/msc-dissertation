["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about an advertisement targeting the tobacco industry affecting young people's perception of smoking in movies and their intention to smoke. Based on the provided documents, there are several studies that relate to this topic. The first study shows a change in attitudes towards restrictions on smoking over time, but no changes in knowledge scores or smoking behavior. This suggests that changing public opinion may be possible through targeted advertising. The second study evaluates a televised stop-smoking clinic and finds that the majority of respondents who quit reported seeing a significant number of programs. The third study shows the extent of tobacco and alcohol advertising in Spanish weeklies, highlighting the potential for mass media campaigns to reach smokers.
