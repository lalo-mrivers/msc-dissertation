["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about educating residents about the potential effects of radiation exposure on CT ordering practices. There are no specific studies or documents provided to directly answer this question. However, we can analyze the information available. The first document talks about transvenous cardiac pacemaker implantation with X-ray control and associates it with a low level of radiation exposure (0.5 mrem/min). This suggests that radiation exposure is not a major concern in this context. The second document discusses a physician intervention program to increase breast cancer screening, which does not relate to CT ordering practices or radiation exposure. The third and fourth documents discuss environmental contamination and dietary counseling for hypercholesterolemic patients, respectively, but do not provide any information about educating residents about the potential effects of radiation exposure on CT ordering practices. Therefore, based on the available information, it is unlikely that educating residents would significantly change their CT ordering practices.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
