["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"This question is about predicting admission at triage. None of the provided documents explicitly discuss this topic or provide a simple objective score to predict admission at triage. The closest related topic is 'Predicting length of stay by patients hospitalized for alcoholism of drug dependence', but it does not mention triage. Another document 'Seeking a social disposition for the medical patient: CAAST, a simple and objective clinical index' discusses a scoring system (CAAST) that can be used to identify high-risk patients, but it is not directly related to predicting admission at triage. Therefore, I will focus on the general idea of using simple clinical variables versus complex multivariate models.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
