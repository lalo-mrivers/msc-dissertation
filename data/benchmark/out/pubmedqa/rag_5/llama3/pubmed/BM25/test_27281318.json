["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking if flexible instruments can create adequate femoral tunnel lengths at 90° of knee flexion in anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. The provided documents don't directly answer this specific question. However, they do provide information about various knee arthrometers and their performance in measuring knee laxity and stability. For example, the document 'Instrumented evaluation of knee laxity: a comparison of five arthrometers' compares the total anterior laxity measurements of normal subjects using different arthrometers. This suggests that there is no guarantee that flexible instruments can create adequate femoral tunnel lengths at 90° of knee flexion in anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, as the results may vary depending on the instrument used.\n\nThe document 'Measurement reproducibility of two commercial knee test devices' highlights the importance of considering the variability and reliability of the devices being used to measure knee laxity and stability. This further supports the idea that there is no straightforward answer to this question without more specific information about the flexible instruments in question.\", \"answer_choice\": A}"]
