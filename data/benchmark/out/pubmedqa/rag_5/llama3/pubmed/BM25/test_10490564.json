["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks if profound hypotensive events can cause myocardial ischaemic events. We need to look for information related to coronary disease, hypotension, and myocardial ischaemia. In the document [Sudden death from ischaemic heart disease: a review of five hundred consecutive cases], it states that functional rather than structural abnormalities are the major cause of death in ischaemic heart attacks. This suggests that factors other than global O2-balance may contribute to myocardial ischaemia. The document [Coronary circulation and myocardial oxygen balance in anesthesia] also found no correlation between global indices of myocardial O2-balance and myocardial ischaemic events. Instead, it suggests that regional factors are more important for the initiation of myocardial ischaemic events. Therefore, we cannot conclude that profound hypotensive events directly cause myocardial ischaemia.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
