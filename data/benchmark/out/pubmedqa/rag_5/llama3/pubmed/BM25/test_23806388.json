["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks whether nomograms designed to predict biochemical recurrence (BCR) do a better job of predicting more clinically relevant prostate cancer outcomes than BCR. The provided documents focus on various aspects of prostate cancer, including its biology, screening, and prediction methods. There is no direct information about nomograms or their comparison with BCR. However, one study evaluates the use of nuclear morphometry, Gleason histologic scoring, clinical stage, and age to predict disease-free survival among patients with prostate cancer. This suggests that there may be more accurate methods for predicting prostate cancer outcomes than just biochemical recurrence. Therefore, it can be inferred that nomograms designed to predict BCR might do a better job of predicting clinically relevant prostate cancer outcomes.\",\n\"answer_choice\": A"]
