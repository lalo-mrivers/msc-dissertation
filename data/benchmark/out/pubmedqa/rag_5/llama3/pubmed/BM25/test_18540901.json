["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe various aspects of beta-adrenergic receptors and their regulation. The question is about transient tachypnea of the newborn (TTN) and its relationship to polymorphisms in the beta-adrenergic receptor encoding genes. TTN is not directly mentioned in the provided documents, but we can look for connections between beta-adrenergic receptors and lung development or function. We can also examine the role of cAMP and protein kinases A in regulating beta-adrenergic receptor concentration. Based on these findings, we can hypothesize that polymorphisms in the beta-adrenergic receptor encoding genes may contribute to TTN.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
