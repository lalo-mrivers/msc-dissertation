["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The provided documents discuss various aspects of patient care before and after surgery. The physical therapy program for pediatric cardiac surgical patients aims to reduce preoperative pulmonary congestion and postoperative complications. Preoperative functional anxiety is addressed in another document, which highlights the importance of coping mechanisms and personal control. Parenteral antibiotics in elective colon surgery do not seem directly related to this question. The study on differential effects of advanced age on neurologic and cardiac risks of coronary artery operations focuses on patient outcomes after surgery. Finally, postoperative cardiac intensive care is analyzed for patients with thoracic cancer. None of these documents explicitly state the impact of nurse-led preoperative education on anxiety or postoperative complications of patients undergoing cardiac surgery. However, the conceptual framework for understanding preoperative functional anxiety emphasizes the importance of personal control and coping mechanisms, which could be addressed through nurse-led education. The physical therapy program also includes education to prepare patients for events ahead, including the physical therapy program. Therefore, it can be inferred that nurse-led preoperative education may have a positive impact on patient anxiety and postoperative complications.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
