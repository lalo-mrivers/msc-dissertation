["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The study 'Functional abnormalities in nonoccluded regions of myocardium after experimental coronary occlusion' suggests that depression of left ventricular function after coronary occlusion may be partially related to previously unrecognized depression of function in apparently 'nonischemic' myocardium. This implies that remote ischemia can cause damage even if it is not directly affected by the coronary occlusion. The studies on lipid peroxides and atherosclerosis, myocardial protection during bypass and arrest, and therapeutic potential of vitamin E against myocardial ischemic-reperfusion injury do not provide direct information about remote ischemic postconditioning. However, they suggest that lipid peroxide content increases in blood of patients with ischemic heart disease due to atherosclerosis of the coronary arteries, which may be relevant to the question.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
