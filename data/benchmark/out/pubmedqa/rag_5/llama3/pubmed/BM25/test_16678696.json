["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about continuity of care experience of residents in an academic vascular department. The relevant documents discuss vascular surgical training, continuity of care in family practice residency programs, and the effect of a primary-care pathway on internal medicine residents' career plans. The main issue here is that operative experience during training was very variable, ranging between 10 and 574 operations reported by new consultants. This suggests that trainees may not be gaining complete surgical care. Additionally, the survey also identified that training in carotid endarterectomy is sometimes deficient, which could also impact continuity of care. Therefore, it can be inferred that residents in an academic vascular department are unlikely to experience complete surgical care during their training.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B: no\""]
