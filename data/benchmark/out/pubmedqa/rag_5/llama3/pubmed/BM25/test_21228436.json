["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking if teaching medical students to investigate medication errors can change their attitudes towards patient safety. Looking at the provided documents, we have studies on teaching students about self-poisoning, psychosomatic medicine, role-play in obstetrics and gynaecology, and first-year medical students' attitudes toward radiology. None of these documents specifically address the investigation of medication errors or patient safety. However, we can draw parallels with other studies that show that exposing students to certain experiences or perspectives can change their attitudes. For example, the study on teaching psychosomatic medicine shows that providing exposure to patients and families can modify attitudes towards patients. Similarly, the study on role-play in obstetrics and gynaecology suggests that giving students opportunities to practice communication skills can also influence their attitudes. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that teaching medical students to investigate medication errors could potentially change their attitudes towards patient safety.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
