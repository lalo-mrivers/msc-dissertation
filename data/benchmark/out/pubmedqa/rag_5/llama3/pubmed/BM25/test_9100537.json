["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The study 'Cytologic differentiation between proliferative and nonproliferative breast disease in mammographically guided fine-needle aspirates' provides a cytologic grading system for characterizing benign breast lesions. The system assigns values ranging from 1 to 4 to each cytologic criterion, and a score based on the sum of the individual values is calculated. A total score ranging from 6 to 10 indicates nonproliferative disease, while a score ranging from 11 to 14 indicates proliferative disease without atypia. Since the scoring system differentiates between these two types of breast disease, it can be concluded that yes, nonproliferative breast disease and proliferative breast disease without atypia can be distinguished by fine-needle aspiration cytology.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
