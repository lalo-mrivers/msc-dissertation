["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents discuss various aspects of magnetic resonance (MR) imaging in the context of uterine neoplasms. The first document evaluates the usefulness of gadopentetate dimeglumine in MR imaging of uterine neoplasms, and highlights the role of dynamic MR images in detecting myometrial invasion by endometrial carcinoma. The second document assesses the sensitivity and specificity of non-enhanced T2-weighted and contrast material-enhanced T1-weighted MR imaging in evaluating the depth of myometrial invasion in patients with proved endometrial cancer. The third document discusses the potential use of quantitative 1H MR imaging to characterize tumor perfusion, including the role of diffusion-weighted MR imaging in this context. Finally, the fourth document compares diffusion-weighted and T2-weighted MR imaging in acute cerebral ischaemia and highlights the diagnostic value of diffusion-weighted images. Based on these documents, it appears that body diffusion-weighted MR imaging can be a useful tool for detecting cancer in non-enhanced MR imaging.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
