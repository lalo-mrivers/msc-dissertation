["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"After reviewing the provided documents, I noticed that none of them directly address the question of injury mortality rates by U.S. states. The study 'Black-white differentials in infant mortality in the South, 1940-1970' does discuss infant mortality rates and their variations across states, but it's focused on a specific geographic region (the South) and time period. The other documents are unrelated to injury mortality or state-level comparisons.\n\nTherefore, I will rely on general knowledge of public health data to inform my answer. Mortality rates can vary significantly by location due to factors like socioeconomic status, access to healthcare, and environmental conditions.\n\nSo, considering these factors, it is likely that some U.S. states have higher/lower injury mortality rates than others.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A: yes\""]
