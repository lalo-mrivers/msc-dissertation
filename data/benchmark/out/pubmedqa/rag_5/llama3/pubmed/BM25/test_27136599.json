["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents provide information on rectal injuries during radical retropubic prostatectomy, laparoscopic proctectomy for infiltrating endometriosis of the rectum, and various types of anastomoses. The question is about performing rectal anastomosis in gynaecological debulking surgery without a diverting stoma. Based on the documents, it appears that primary closure alone can be successful for managing rectal injuries recognized during surgery in previously non-irradiated patients undergoing radical retropubic prostatectomy. Additionally, the double stapling technique provides a safe method for rectal reconstruction at or near the dentate line without requiring a diverting colostomy. These findings suggest that it may be safe to perform rectal anastomosis in gynaecological debulking surgery without a diverting stoma.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
