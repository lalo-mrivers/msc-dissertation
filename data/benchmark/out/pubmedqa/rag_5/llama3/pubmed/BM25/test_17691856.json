["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about midwives' competence being affected by working in a rural location. There are no documents provided that directly address this specific topic. However, we can draw parallels from the information given. The document 'Meeting the continuing education needs of nurses in rural settings' suggests that rural nurses may face unique challenges and require specialized training. Similarly, the document 'Primary care in Transkei' highlights the importance of generalist practitioners working in rural areas. While these documents do not directly address midwives, they imply that working in a rural location can present unique challenges for healthcare professionals.\n\nIn contrast, the document 'The comparative retention of National Health Service Corps and other rural physicians' focuses on the retention rates of physicians working in rural areas, but does not provide information specific to midwives. The documents 'Interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra) as a probe and as a treatment for IL-1 mediated disease' and '[The voluntary health auxiliary. Application to the Peruvian Altiplano of new concepts of primary health care in disadvantaged communities]' are unrelated to the topic.\n\nBased on this analysis, it seems reasonable to assume that midwives working in rural locations may face similar challenges and require specialized training or support. However, without direct evidence, it is difficult to make a definitive statement about the impact of working in a rural location on midwives' competence.\n\nTherefore, I will choose an answer based on my step-by-step thinking:\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A: yes\"\n}"]
