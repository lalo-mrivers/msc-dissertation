["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks if single-agent mitoxantrone is as effective as combination chemotherapy. We can look for studies that compare the two. The document 'Carboplatin (CBDCA), 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and mitoxantrone (DHAD): an effective and well tolerated regimen for metastatic breast cancer' shows a combination of CBDCA, 5-FU, and DHAD has a response rate of 44% with a median duration of remission of 11.5+ months.
