["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about orthostatic myoclonus as an underrecognized cause of unsteadiness. There are no documents that explicitly mention 'orthostatic myoclonus' or its relation to unsteadiness. However, we do have a document on drug-induced orthostatic hypotension and another on idiopathic palatal myoclonus. Orthostatic hypotension is mentioned as a potential side effect of psychiatric medications and can cause falls and injuries. Palatal myoclonus is described as an abnormal movement disorder affecting the palate, but it's not specifically linked to unsteadiness. Therefore, based on available information, we cannot conclusively say that orthostatic myoclonus is an underrecognized cause of unsteadiness.\", \"answer_choice\": A}"]
