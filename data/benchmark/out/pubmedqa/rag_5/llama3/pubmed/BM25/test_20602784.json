["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents suggest that there is a racial disparity in breast cancer mortality rates. The study on education and breast cancer mortality found no relation between level of education and breast cancer mortality, which may indicate that socioeconomic status does not play a significant role in breast cancer mortality. However, the study on differences between black and white women with breast cancer found that black women were more likely to have stage IV breast cancer and larger tumors at presentation, which may contribute to poorer survival rates. The study on plasma IgA, IgG, and IgM levels did not find a significant association between immunoglobulin levels and breast cancer incidence or mortality. Finally, the risk factors in breast cancer include age, marital status, geographic location, racial or ethnic extraction, and socioeconomic status, which may contribute to racial disparities in breast cancer mortality rates. Based on these findings, it is likely that scale (or racial disparity) matters in identifying racial disparities in breast cancer mortality.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"]
