["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the provided documents, it can be seen that cyanoacrylate adhesives are used in vascular anastomosis to prevent neointimal hyperplasia. It was found that sutureless anastomosis using cyanoacrylate had a patency rate of 75% after 12 months with minimal pannus thickness. This suggests that cyanoacrylate can be a reliable method for preventing anastomotic complications in vascular surgery. However, there is no direct evidence on the use of cyanoacrylate in intestinal anastomosis. Therefore, it cannot be concluded that its use is a good and reliable alternative for intestinal anastomosis.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
