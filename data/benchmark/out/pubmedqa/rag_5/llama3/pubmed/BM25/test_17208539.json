["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the long-term results of transanal pull-through versus transabdominal pull-through. The provided documents discuss various surgical procedures, including endoanal pull-through during ileal pouch-anal anastomosis, abdominoperineal endoanal pull-through resection with delayed colorectal anastomosis, and repair of rectovaginal fistulas. However, none of these documents directly compare the long-term results of transanal versus transabdominal pull-through. Therefore, it is not possible to determine if the long-term results are equal based on the provided information.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
