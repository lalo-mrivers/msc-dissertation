["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe various studies on phonological awareness, but none of them directly address the question of whether a specialized training of phonological awareness is indicated in every preschool child. However, one study mentions that 'phonological awareness is associated closely with productive phonological ability early in development.' This suggests that phonological awareness may be an important aspect of language development in young children. Another study discusses the importance of sun awareness and information dissemination to nursery school staff and parents, but this does not directly relate to phonological awareness or training. The remaining studies explore topics such as developmental-behavioral dysfunction, timing characteristics of speech after brain damage, and semantic paralexias facilitated by tachistoscopic reading in a patient with impairment of phonological recoding. None of these studies provide evidence that would support or refute the notion that every preschool child requires specialized training of phonological awareness.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B: no\"\n}"]
