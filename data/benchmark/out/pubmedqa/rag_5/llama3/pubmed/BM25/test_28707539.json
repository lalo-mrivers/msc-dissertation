["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to the provided documents, visceral adipose tissue area measurement at a single level does not directly represent visceral adipose tissue volume. However, we can infer that visceral-to-subcutaneous adipose tissue ratio is a better index of body fat distribution than waist-to-hip ratio (as mentioned in 'Evaluation of regional body fat distribution: comparison between W/H ratio and computed tomography in obese women'). This suggests that measuring visceral adipose tissue area at multiple levels or using imaging modalities like computerized tomography could provide a more accurate representation of visceral adipose tissue volume.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
