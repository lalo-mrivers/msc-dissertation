["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The provided documents discuss various aspects of metastatic carcinoma to the cervical nodes from an unknown head and neck primary site. One document recommends against excision biopsy of a cervical lymph node infiltrated by metastatic carcinoma, as it is associated with an increased incidence of local wound recurrence and distant metastases. This suggests that a more conservative approach may be necessary. Another document states that patients who present with a metastatic node in the neck should first have a thorough examination of the upper part of the respiratory tract before considering biopsy or excision of the neck tumour. This further supports a cautious approach. The document on Metastasis to neck from unknown primary tumor suggests that patients with high or posterior cervical lymph node involvement were irradiated with fields including the nasopharynx and oropharynx, implying that radiotherapy may be effective in treating these cases without the need for neck dissection.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
