["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about preoperative staging of patients with liver metastases of colorectal carcinoma. PET/CT is a modern imaging modality that can provide functional information about the liver lesions. However, based on the provided documents, we don't have any direct evidence about the effectiveness of PET/CT in this specific context. We do know that liver scan had an overall accuracy of 95% but only identified 50% of patients with occult metastases to the liver (document 2). Diagnostic accuracy of 99mTc-anti-CEA immunoscintigraphy was 21% for all liver lesions, but 47% considering the number of patients (document 3). Plasma carcinoembryonic antigen and erythrocyte sedimentation rate were found to be correlated with disease status in patients with colorectal carcinoma (document 4). Therefore, we can conclude that PET/CT may potentially add information about the liver lesions, but we need more specific data to determine its effectiveness.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B: no\""]
