["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the effectiveness of concomitant anterior/apical repair during midurethral sling on overactive bladder component of mixed incontinence. The relevant documents are the study of bladder function in benign prostatic hyperplasia, and the report on repair of severe anterior vaginal wall prolapse (grade IV cystourethrocele).
