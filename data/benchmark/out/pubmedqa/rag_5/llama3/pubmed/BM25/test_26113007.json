["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking whether arch form is influenced by sagittal molar relationship or Bolton tooth-size discrepancy. The documents provided suggest that there are relationships between the occlusal plane and plantar arches (EMG study), and mandibular arch perimeter can be affected by orthodontic expansion, which may impact arch form. Additionally, a population study on Melanesians found differences in dental occlusion and arches among males and females of different ages. However, there is no direct evidence linking sagittal molar relationship or Bolton tooth-size discrepancy to arch form.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
