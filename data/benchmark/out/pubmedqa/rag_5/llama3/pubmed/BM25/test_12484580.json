["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about whether a written information sheet improves recall by patients for total hip arthroplasty. We can look at the documents provided. The first document talks about informed consent and recalls of patients tested postoperatively, which suggests that patients may not accurately remember major portions of their informed consent interview even 4-6 months later. This implies that there might be a limitation to patient recall regardless of whether it's written or verbal information. The second document discusses the 'loi Huriet' requirement for written consent from patients and finds that most patients (70%) are not shocked by this procedure, but it doesn't specifically address written information sheets in the context of total hip arthroplasty. The third document explains the legal principle of informed consent in surgery and presents a study on the efficacy of verbal information as part of the informed consent process in oral and maxillofacial surgery. This suggests that verbal information may be more effective than written information for patient recall. Finally, the fourth document discusses informed consent requirements and medicolegal implications but doesn't specifically address total hip arthroplasty or written information sheets. Based on this analysis, it's likely that a written information sheet may not improve recall by patients for total hip arthroplasty.\", \n\"answer_choice\": B"]
