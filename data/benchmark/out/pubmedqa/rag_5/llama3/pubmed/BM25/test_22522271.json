["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about late-night salivary cortisol as a screening test for possible cortisol excess in obese patients with Type 2 diabetes. The relevant documents discuss different tests and methods for diagnosing Cushing's syndrome, which involves excessive cortisol production. The document on spot determinations of urinary cortisol suggests that this method can be used to screen for Cushing's syndrome, but it does not specifically mention salivary cortisol or obese patients with Type 2 diabetes. Therefore, we cannot directly conclude whether late-night salivary cortisol is a better screening test than standard tests in these patients.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"C\"\n}"]
