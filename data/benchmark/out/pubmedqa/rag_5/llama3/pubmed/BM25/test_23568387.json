["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"There is no direct mention of bicompartmental knee arthroplasty compared to total knee arthroplasty. However, one study mentioned the use of a fully congruous meniscal bearing prosthesis in the Oxford knee which showed reduced wear in knee arthroplasty. Another study talked about muscle training in chronic anterior cruciate ligament insufficiency and its effect on muscle strength and knee function. There is no clear answer that suggests bicompartmental knee arthroplasty is more favourable to knee muscle strength and physical performance compared to total knee arthroplasty.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
