["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about using decisional algorithms to assess causality of spontaneously reported adverse drug reactions (ADRs). The relevant documents provide information on recognition and assessment of ADRs, including the importance of knowledge of differences between adult and child, lesser variety of pathologies in children, and the use of standardized methods for assessing causality. Lovastatin-induced rhabdomyolysis is mentioned as an adverse effect that may occur in the absence of other medications. There is no direct mention of decisional algorithms or introspection in the provided documents. However, it can be inferred that a standardized method could be used to assess causality in individual cases, similar to how experts use their knowledge to do so. Therefore, the answer is not directly supported by the provided information.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
