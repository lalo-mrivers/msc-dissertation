["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks if there is a need for pelvic CT scan in cases of renal cell carcinoma. From the provided documents, we can see that CT scans are used to detect intraabdominal and pelvic adenopathy in lymphoma patients, and it's a highly accurate method. Additionally, it's mentioned that CT is superior to lymphangiography in demonstrating abnormality in areas like the mesenteric nodes. In one of the cases presented, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was used to demonstrate the extent of renal cell carcinoma thrombus into the inferior vena cava and right atrium. There is no specific information on pelvic CT scans for renal cell carcinoma staging. However, we can infer that CT scans may be useful in detecting pelvic nodal involvement in cases of renal cell carcinoma.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
