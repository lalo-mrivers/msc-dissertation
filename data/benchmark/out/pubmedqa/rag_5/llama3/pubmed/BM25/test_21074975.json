["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about Ultra High Risk (UHR) criteria for psychosis. After reviewing the documents, I didn't find any information that directly addresses this specific question. However, one of the documents mentions a study on the frequency of consulting for one of three major psychiatric diagnostic groups (psychosis, neurosis, or 'other') depending on the type of municipality (rural, coastal, urban) where the patient was resident. This study found a higher risk of consulting for psychosis among coastal residents compared to rural residents. Another document mentions a study on the mismatch of coronary risk and treatment intensity under the National Cholesterol Education Program guidelines. While not directly related to UHR criteria, it highlights inconsistencies in guidelines that could lead to over- or undertreatment. Based on this information, I will choose an answer.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B: no\""]
