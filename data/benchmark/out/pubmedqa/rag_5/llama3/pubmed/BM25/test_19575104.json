["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about whether foreign bodies migrate through the body towards the heart. From the provided documents, we can see that most foreign bodies pass through the gastrointestinal tract spontaneously (Ingested foreign bodies of the gastrointestinal tract). This suggests that foreign bodies do not necessarily migrate towards the heart. Similarly, in the case of ingested foreign bodies that require surgical removal due to perforation, hemorrhage, or obstruction, there is no mention of migration towards the heart.
