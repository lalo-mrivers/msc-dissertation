["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The provided documents mainly discuss preterm labor, delivery, and birth outcomes. None of the studies explicitly explore whether the clinical presentation of a prior preterm birth predicts risk in a subsequent pregnancy.

Therefore, based on the available information, we cannot conclude that the clinical presentation of a prior preterm birth predicts risk in a subsequent pregnancy.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
