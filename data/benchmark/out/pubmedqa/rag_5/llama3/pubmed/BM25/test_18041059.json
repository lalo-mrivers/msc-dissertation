["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The provided documents discuss the role of tamoxifen in breast cancer treatment and prevention. There is a mention of concerns about long-term administration of antiestrogen therapy increasing bone loss and coronary heart disease risk. However, it is noted that tamoxifen has estrogen-like qualities in postmenopausal women, which may increase the risk of endometrial carcinoma but also preserves bone density and decreases circulating cholesterol. This suggests that tamoxifen may not significantly increase cardiovascular risk in postmenopausal women with early breast cancer.\n\nThere is no mention of aromatase inhibitors specifically increasing cardiovascular risk in postmenopausal women with early breast cancer. The only relevant information about aromatase inhibitors comes from a study on adjuvant aminoglutethimide, which showed that long-term follow-up did not demonstrate an overall benefit for event-free survival or overall survival.\n\nAromatase inhibitors are mentioned as having different biologic mechanisms of action compared to tamoxifen. However, there is no direct evidence presented in the provided documents regarding their impact on cardiovascular risk.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the information provided, it seems that adjuvant aromatase inhibitors may not significantly increase cardiovascular risk in postmenopausal women with early breast cancer.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
