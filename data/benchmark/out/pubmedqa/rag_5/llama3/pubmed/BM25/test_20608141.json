["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking whether PSA levels that repeatedly fluctuate are reassuring enough to avoid biopsy. We need to look at the studies provided for any information on this topic. The first study shows that after radiation therapy, PSA levels decreased as compared to initial value in 88.3% of patients. It had fallen to 10 ng/ml or less in 54 (59%) out of the 91 patients with initial abnormal PSA levels. This suggests that PSA levels can decrease over time, which may be reassuring. However, it does not specifically address repeatedly fluctuating PSA levels. The second study shows that after digital rectal examination (DRE), serum PSA levels changed insignificantly in most patients. This suggests that DRE may not significantly affect PSA levels, but it still does not directly answer the question about repeatedly fluctuating PSA levels. The third study shows that during radiation therapy, PSA levels decreased with a median half-life of 58.5 days, and some patients' PSA levels did not decrease or even increased. This suggests that PSA levels can fluctuate during radiation therapy, but it is unclear whether this would be reassuring enough to avoid biopsy.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
