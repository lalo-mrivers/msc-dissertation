["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about biomolecular identification of allergenic pollen. The provided documents discuss various aspects such as purification of an allergen preparation from timothy pollen, isolation of cDNA encoding a major allergenic protein from rye-grass pollen, and the use of bacteriophage phi X-174 as an aerobiological marker for surgical plume generated by the electromagnetic field focusing system. These documents suggest that biomolecular identification is possible and relevant to aerobiological monitoring. Therefore, the answer is likely to be 'yes'.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
