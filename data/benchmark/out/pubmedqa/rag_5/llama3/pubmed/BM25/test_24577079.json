["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks if strategy training reduces age-related deficits in working memory. In the provided documents, there is a study that examines the effects of tetrahydroaminoacridine (THA) on spatial reference and spatial working memory learning in young intact/medial septal (MS)-lesioned and aged rats. The study finds that THA at 3 mg/kg partially stabilized age-induced spatial reference memory deficits, but was ineffective at alleviating age-related working memory deficits. This suggests that strategy training may not be effective in reducing age-related deficits in working memory.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
