["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the inverse equity hypothesis which states that as coverage of cancer screening increases, mortality rates from uterine cancer decrease. The documents provide information on the relationship between mass screening for uterine cancer and reduction in mortality rate. In Japan, a higher coverage rate was associated with a greater percent reduction in age-adjusted death rate (AADR) from uterine cancer. Similarly, in Louisville, Kentucky, a high degree of success in screening women according to age was correlated with a remarkable decrease in mortality rates from uterine cancer. The documents do not provide information on middle-income countries specifically, but the inverse equity hypothesis can be applied generally. Therefore, it is likely that this hypothesis applies to coverage of cancer screening in middle-income countries as well.\", \"answer_choice\": A}"]
