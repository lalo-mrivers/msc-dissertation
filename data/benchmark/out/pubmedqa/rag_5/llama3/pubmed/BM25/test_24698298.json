["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about whether MR arthrography of the shoulder needs local anesthesia. From the provided documents, there is no direct mention of the need for local anesthesia during MR arthrography of the shoulder. However, we can infer that local anesthesia may not be necessary based on the reports of arthrography and MR imaging studies. For instance, in [Adhesive capsulitis of the shoulder: a comparative study of arthrography with intra-articular corticotherapy and with or without capsular distension], patients underwent arthrography and received an intra-articular injection of corticosteroids, but local anesthesia was not mentioned as necessary. Similarly, in [Chronic wrist pain: spin-echo and short tau inversion recovery MR imaging and conventional and MR arthrography], patients underwent MR imaging and arthrography without mention of the need for local anesthesia. Therefore, based on the available information, it appears that local anesthesia may not be necessary during MR arthrography of the shoulder.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
