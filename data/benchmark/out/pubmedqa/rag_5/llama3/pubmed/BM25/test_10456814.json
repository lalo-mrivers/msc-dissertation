["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks if desflurane alters left ventricular function when used to control surgical stimulation during aortic surgery. The relevant documents describe the cardiovascular actions of desflurane with and without nitrous oxide during spontaneous ventilation in humans, as well as its effects on regional tissue perfusion in dogs. These studies show that desflurane increases cardiac index, stroke volume, central venous pressure, left ventricular ejection fraction, velocity of circumferential fiber shortening, oxygen transport, and the ratio of oxygen transport to oxygen consumption. However, there is no specific information provided about the use of desflurane to control surgical stimulation during aortic surgery. Therefore, we cannot definitively say whether desflurane alters left ventricular function in this context.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
