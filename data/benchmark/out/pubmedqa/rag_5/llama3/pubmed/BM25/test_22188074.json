["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant studies focus on disabilities and impairments of activities of daily living as possible risk factors for dementia. The study by [Disabilities and impairment in activities of daily living as possible risk factors in dementia: prospective study in Basel 1986] finds that impairments of hearing, mobility, cutting toenails, and general physical activity are the conditions most frequently named. This suggests that disabilities and impairments of activities of daily living could be risk factors for dementia. In [Assessment of activities of daily living in the elderly], a population of 76-year-olds were assessed using the Katz' Index of ADL, which showed that 65% were independent, 22% dependent in instrumental activities, and 13% dependent in both personal and instrumental activities. This indicates that there is a correlation between impairments in activities of daily living and dementia. Additionally, [Functional limitations among home health care users in the National Health Interview Survey Supplement on Aging] shows that home health care users are significantly more limited than controls in every ADL and IADL, suggesting that disabilities and impairments can predict dementia. Finally, [Diagnosis of dementia in a heterogeneous population] uses neuropsychological tests to diagnose dementia and finds that education-corrected scores may be required to adjust for the effects of education on test performance. This suggests that adjusting for disabilities and impairments could also be necessary when predicting dementia.\",\n\"answer_choice\": A"]
