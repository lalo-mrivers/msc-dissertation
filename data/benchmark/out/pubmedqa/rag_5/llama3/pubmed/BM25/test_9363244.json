["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant studies provided do not directly address the question of whether occupational nuclear power plant radiation affects conception and pregnancy. However, one study [A survey of annual radiation dose for radiation workers from occupational and medical exposures in Kyushu] reported that medical exposure is much higher than occupational exposure among workers exposed to radiation, with average annual effective dose equivalents for medical and occupational exposure being 4.0-7.5 mSv and 2.4-3.6 mSv, respectively. This suggests that the risk of radiation-induced reproductive effects may be higher due to medical exposure.\n\nAnother study [The results of clinico-hygienic research in the region of the Mozyr industrial center following the accident at the Chernobyl Atomic Electric Power Station] reported on the possible radiation origin of astheno-depressive and astheno-somatic disorders developing by nonspecific stress mechanisms. This could be relevant to the question, but it does not directly address conception and pregnancy.\n\nThere is no other direct information provided in the studies that addresses the specific question of whether occupational nuclear power plant radiation affects conception and pregnancy. Therefore, we must rely on general principles and expert opinion to inform our answer.\n\nBased on general knowledge about ionizing radiation and its effects on reproductive health, it is possible that high levels of radiation exposure could affect conception and pregnancy. However, this would require more specific information than what is provided in the studies to confirm or deny the relationship between occupational nuclear power plant radiation and conception and pregnancy.\", \n\"answer_choice\": B"]
