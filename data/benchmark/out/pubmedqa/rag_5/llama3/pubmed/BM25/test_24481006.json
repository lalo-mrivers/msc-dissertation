["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about cavitation in proximal surfaces. We need to look for relevant information on cavitation in the provided documents. One of the documents talks about computed tomography (CT) scans and chest radiographs, and mentions that all nodules larger than 2 cm in diameter showed evidence of cavitation in CT scans. This suggests that cavitation is a characteristic feature of nodules in CT scans. Since the question specifically asks about cone beam computed tomography examination, we can infer that the context is also related to CT scans. Therefore, it makes sense to report cavitation in proximal surfaces in a cone beam computed tomography examination.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
