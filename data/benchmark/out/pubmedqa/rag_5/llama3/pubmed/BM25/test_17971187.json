["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks whether family history is reliable to choose which school children should be screened for cholesterol. We have two relevant documents that address this issue. The first document states that 'systematic planning is essential for success and must include a counseling and educational intervention coupled with an active referral and follow-up program.' This suggests that cholesterol screening can be done in schools, but it's not clear if family history can guide the selection of which children to screen. The second document discusses the importance of age-, sex-, and race-specific reference data for determining normal values for blood lipids in children. It notes a large variance in 'normal' values worldwide, emphasizing the need for such specific data to determine intervention points. Based on these documents, it seems that family history may not be the most reliable factor in choosing which school children to screen for cholesterol. Instead, age- and sex-specific reference data may be more important.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
