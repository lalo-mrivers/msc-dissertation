["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks if digoxin use for cardiovascular disease is associated with risk of prostate cancer. The relevant document about prostatic cancer is 'Overview of enzyme inhibitors and anti-androgens in prostatic cancer'. There are no direct mentions of acid phosphatase (PAP) or prostate specific antigen (PSA) in this document, but it discusses various therapies for prostate cancer, including surgical castration, estrogen therapy, gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists, and anti-androgens. None of these therapies involve digoxin. Therefore, there is no evidence to suggest that digoxin use for cardiovascular disease is associated with risk of prostate cancer.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
