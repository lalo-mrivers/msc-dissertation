["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe mechanical power spent to accelerate limbs during level walking and running. In running, the total work done by muscles (W(tot)) increases as the square of speed up to about 20 km/hr. At higher speeds, W(int) > W(ext). The efficiency of positive work was measured from the ratio W(tot)/Net energy expenditure: this is greater than 0.25 indicating that both in walking and running the muscles utilize, during shortening, some energy stored during a previous phase of negative work (stretching).\n\nIn another study, the power limits conditioning step frequency in human running were examined. The results showed that at high speeds, the step frequency becomes lower than the apparent natural frequency of the body's bouncing system. This is due to a relative increase of the vertical component of the muscular push and requires a greater power to maintain the motion of the centre of gravity.\n\nThe synchronization of muscle activity and body segment movements during a running cycle was also studied using computerization to synchronize electromyography (EMG) and cinematography (CMG). Surface electrodes monitored the muscle action potentials from various muscles as 10 female subjects ran on a treadmill at speeds of 2.5 m/s and 3.5 m/s.\n\nFinally, measurements of muscle stiffness and the mechanism of elastic storage of energy in hopping kangaroos were examined. A kangaroo hopping above a certain speed appears to consume less oxygen than a quadrupedal mammal, of similar weight, running at the same speed. This is thought to be achieved by storage of elastic energy in tendons and ligaments.\n\nConsidering these studies, muscle power does not seem to be directly related to changes of direction during running. The focus on level walking and running, or high-speed running with varying step frequencies, suggests that changes of direction are not the primary factor influencing muscle power.\n\nTherefore, I choose the answer: B: no\", \n\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
