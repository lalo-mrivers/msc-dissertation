["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe various aspects of unicompartmental knee replacement, including the use of intramedullary instrumentation for alignment, the evaluation of kinematics and stability after implantation, and the consideration of different implant designs. However, none of these documents specifically address the relationship between the type of tibial component and mechanical alignment in unicompartmental knee replacement. Therefore, based on the information provided, it is not possible to determine whether the type of tibial component affects mechanical alignment.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
