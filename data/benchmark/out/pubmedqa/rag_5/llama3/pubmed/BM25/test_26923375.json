["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking if non-invasive diagnosis of esophageal varices in patients with compensated hepatic cirrhosis is possible by duplex Doppler ultrasonography. In the provided documents, we can see that endosonography was used to evaluate the usefulness of endosonography in the follow-up of the variceal status during intravariceal sclerotherapy of esophageal varices. This suggests that endosonography can be used for non-invasive diagnosis and follow-up of esophageal varices. Additionally, duplex Doppler ultrasonography was also mentioned as a technique used in the study of portal hypertension and cirrhosis, specifically for the assessment of portal blood direction. Therefore, based on these findings, we can conclude that non-invasive diagnosis of esophageal varices is possible by duplex Doppler ultrasonography.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
