["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents discuss lymph node metastasis in gastric cancer. The study on predictors of lymph node metastasis in early gastric cancer found that independent risk factors for lymph node metastasis were large tumour size, lymphatic vessel involvement and invasion into the submucosal layer. Another study showed that regional lymph node metastasis was associated with larger tumour, higher incidence of submucosal invasion, higher rate of lymphatic vessel involvement, advanced stage of disease and non-curative resection rate. None of these studies mention dickkopf-3 or its relation to lymph node metastasis.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
