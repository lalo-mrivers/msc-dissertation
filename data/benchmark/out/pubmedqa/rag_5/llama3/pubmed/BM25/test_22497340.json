["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents describe various experiments on vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) and otolith organs. The first document describes plasticity of the human otolith-ocular reflex, which suggests that physiologic alteration of the vestibulo-ocular reflex using deliberately mismatched visual and semicircular canal stimuli induces changes in both canal-ocular and otolith-ocular responses. This implies a shared central nervous system pathway responsible for controlling the gains of canal-ocular and otolith-ocular reflexes.\n\nThe second document investigates the effects of otolith organ stimulation by linear acceleration on VOR gain in squirrel monkeys. The results show that eccentric rotation (ECR) significantly enhances VOR gain over centric rotation at 1.0 Hz, but not at 0.5 Hz. This suggests that tangential acceleration along the interaural axis stimulates the utricular maculae, inducing horizontal eye movements.\n\nThe third document examines changes in the horizontal vestibulo-ocular reflex (HVOR) during off-axis rotation when there is a centripetal acceleration along the animal's interaural axis. The results show that the HVOR time constant was slightly shortened when the resultant otolith force was not parallel to the animal's vertical axis.\n\nThe fourth document discusses vestibular nystagmus as a result of interactions between semicircular canals and otolithic membrane subsystems of the vestibular system. It suggests that the ratio of otolith afferent signals in the right and left labyrinths determines the pattern of changes of otolith afferentation.\n\nThe fifth document investigates response characteristics of semicircular canal and otolith systems in cat. II. Responses of trochlear motoneurons show that most TMns receive an otolithic input, with firing rate proportional to lateral head tilt and responding to pitch with an increase and decrease in firing rate on nose-up and nose-down positioning.\n\nBased on these documents, it can be inferred that the horizontal semicircular canal ocular reflex is influenced by otolith organs' input.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\""]
