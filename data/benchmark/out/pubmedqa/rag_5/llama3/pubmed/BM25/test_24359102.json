The relevant document that provides information on the follow-up survey of patients with allergic contact dermatitis is 'Occupational dermatitis in a 10-year material'. According to this study, after a 2-3 year follow-up, the eczema was healed in one-quarter of the patients, one-half had periodic symptoms, and one-quarter had permanent symptoms.

This suggests that the omnipresence of the allergen is not a factor in determining the prognosis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
