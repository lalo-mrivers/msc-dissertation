["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking whether immediate breast reconstruction compromises the delivery of adjuvant chemotherapy. Looking at the provided documents, we see that in one study, no delays were caused by immediate breast reconstruction, and patients went on to receive adjuvant chemotherapy without issue. This suggests that immediate breast reconstruction does not compromise the delivery of adjuvant chemotherapy. Additionally, another document states that reconstruction is often less complex if done immediately than if delayed, even though radiation increases the chances of capsular contracture, further supporting the idea that immediate breast reconstruction does not negatively impact the delivery of adjuvant chemotherapy.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
