["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks if breast cancer survival is improving. The first document mentions a follow-up study of 5623 breast cancer patients, which shows that overall and breast cancer death rates are significantly higher than expected even at long-term follow-up. This suggests that breast cancer may be a systemic disease when clinically diagnosed, but provides no evidence of a 'clinical' cure for breast cancer patients.

There is no direct evidence to suggest that breast cancer survival is improving.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
