["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks if serovar specific immunity to Neisseria gonorrhoeae exists. The relevant documents suggest that strains of gonococcus were shown to be immunologically heterologous (Immunological and serological diversity of Neisseria gonorrhoeae). This means that the immune response is not specific to a particular strain or serovar. Additionally, sera devoid of bactericidal activity reflected the lack of cross-protection in subcutaneous chambers, indicating that immunity is not transferable between different strains.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
