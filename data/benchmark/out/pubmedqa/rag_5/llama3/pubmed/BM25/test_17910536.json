["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"There is no direct information about adults with mild intellectual disabilities in the provided documents. However, we can draw some conclusions from the studies on reading comprehension skills. The first study showed that children with early hydrocephalus had deficits in reading comprehension compared to controls, even when controlling for word recognition ability. This suggests that reading comprehension can be impaired in individuals with certain neurological or developmental conditions.\n\nThe second and third studies focused on aphasic patients and adults' reading comprehension, respectively. These studies did not specifically investigate mild intellectual disabilities, but they suggest that reading comprehension is related to linguistic functioning and working memory. Adults' reading comprehension was affected by syntactic complexity and working memory limitations.\n\nThe fourth study analyzed the relationship between reading comprehension, listening comprehension, and intelligence indicators. It suggested emphasizing the role of listening comprehension in assessing and predicting reading disabilities.\n\nBased on these findings, it can be inferred that adults with mild intellectual disabilities may have impaired reading comprehension ability, which could be improved through targeted interventions addressing linguistic functioning, working memory, or other factors contributing to their reading difficulties.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A: yes\""]
