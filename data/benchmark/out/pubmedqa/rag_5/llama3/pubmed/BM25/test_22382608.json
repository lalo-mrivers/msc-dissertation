["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The provided documents describe various studies on different diseases, including Parkinson's disease and essential tremor. The most relevant information for this question is the SPECT study described in 'Cognition and 99Tcm-HMPAO SPECT in Parkinson\\'s disease.' This study found that cortical perfusion defects were highly correlated with cognitive impairment in patients with Parkinson\\'s disease. There is no direct evidence of a correlation between essential tremor and Parkinson\\'s disease from this study.\\r\\nThe other studies provided do not provide information on the use of SPECT scans or I-123-Ioflupane (DaTSCAN) in essential tremor patients.\\r\\nTherefore, based on the available information, there is no correlation between SPECT study with I-123-Ioflupane (DaTSCAN) and Parkinson\\'s disease in essential tremor patients.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"]
