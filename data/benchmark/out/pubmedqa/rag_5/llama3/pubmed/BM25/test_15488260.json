["{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about whether the type of remission after a major depressive episode is an important risk factor to relapses in a 4-year follow-up. We need to analyze the provided documents to determine if this information is mentioned or not. The first document talks about predictors of relapse into major depressive disorder, but it doesn't mention the type of remission. The second document discusses depressive symptoms as relative and attributable risk factors for first-onset major depression, but it's also silent on the topic of remission types. The third document is about the role of the adrenal in relapses of experimental allergic encephalomyelitis, which has no relevance to this question. The fourth document talks about tianeptine in the prevention of depressive relapse and recurrence, but it doesn't provide any information on remission types either. Therefore, we can conclude that none of the provided documents mention the type of remission after a major depressive episode as an important risk factor to relapses in a 4-year follow-up.\", \"answer_choice\": B}"]
