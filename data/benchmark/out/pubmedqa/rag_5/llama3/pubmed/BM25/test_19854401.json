["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about attaining negative margins in breast-conservation operations. We need to look at the documents provided. In 'Radiotherapeutic considerations', it's mentioned that focally positive margins of resection are not a contraindication, provided that a boost dose of radiation is employed. This suggests that there might be some disagreement among breast surgeons about the importance of negative margins. Additionally, in 'Evaluation of resection margins after breast conservative surgery with monoclonal antibodies', it's mentioned that 31% of breast margins contained tumor cells, whereas only 12% were histologically positive.
