["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about locoregional opening of the rodent blood-brain barrier for paclitaxel using Nd:YAG laser-induced thermo therapy. This is related to the document 'Brain tissue injury and blood-brain barrier opening induced by injection of LGE2 or PGE2', which discusses the breakdown of the blood-brain barrier due to prostaglandins and levuglandins. Another relevant document is 'Photodynamic therapy using pheophorbide a and Nd:YAG laser', which describes the use of an acoustic Q-switched neodymium yttrium-aluminum-garnet (Nd:YAG) laser for photodynamic therapy. This information suggests that the Nd:YAG laser can be used to open the blood-brain barrier. The question does not specify whether this is a new concept, but it does involve using the Nd:YAG laser-induced thermo therapy.\",\n\"answer_choice\": A"]
