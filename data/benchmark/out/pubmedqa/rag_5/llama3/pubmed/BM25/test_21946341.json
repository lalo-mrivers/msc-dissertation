["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"After reviewing the provided documents, we can see that complex fractionated atrial electrograms are characteristic of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. In patients with sick sinus syndrome and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, abnormal atrial electrograms were more widely distributed in the right atrium compared to those without tachycardia. Additionally, the electrophysiological abnormalities of the atrial muscle in patients with sinus node dysfunction without tachyarrhythmias show a greater extent of compromised atrial muscle is associated with an increased likelihood of developing paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. Therefore, it can be inferred that complex fractionated atrial electrograms recorded during atrial fibrillation are related to sinus rhythm fractionation.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
