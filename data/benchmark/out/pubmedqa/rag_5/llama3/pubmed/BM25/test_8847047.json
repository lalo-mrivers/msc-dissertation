["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the prognosis of well differentiated small hepatocellular carcinoma. In the provided documents, there are no specific studies or findings related to the prognosis of well differentiated small hepatocellular carcinoma. However, we can look at other relevant information. For example, in the document 'Development and growth pattern of small hepatocellular carcinomas in woodchucks--analysis of an animal model of human hepatocellular carcinoma by ultrasonography', it is mentioned that when volumes of tumors were less than 10 cm3 they grew very slowly but when tumors were larger than 10 cm3 their volume increased very rapidly. This information suggests that the tumor size may be a factor in determining prognosis.\n\nIn the document 'Morphometric analysis of hepatocellular carcinoma: diagnostic usefulness of numerical nuclear density and its ratio', it is mentioned that well differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma was combined with active large nodular cirrhosis. This information does not directly relate to the prognosis of well differentiated small hepatocellular carcinoma, but rather provides additional context about the disease.\n\nThe other documents provided do not specifically address the prognosis of well differentiated small hepatocellular carcinoma either. Therefore, we can conclude that based on the available information, it is uncertain whether well differentiated small hepatocellular carcinoma is clinically early cancer or not. Hence, the answer choice 'C: maybe' seems most appropriate.\",\n\"answer_choice\": C"]
