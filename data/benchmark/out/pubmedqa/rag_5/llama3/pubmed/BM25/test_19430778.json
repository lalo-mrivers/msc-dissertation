["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks if magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can accurately predict concordant pain provocation during provocative disc injection. Let's look at the relevant documents. The first document talks about a correlation between MRI and discography. It states that many cases of MRI could not reliably predict or replace discography, which suggests that MRI may not be accurate in predicting pain provocation. The second document is about awake discography and MRI. It states that MRI correlated with discography in 55% of the cases and differed in 45%. This also suggests that MRI may not accurately predict pain provocation. The third document talks about high-intensity zones on MRI, which can be a diagnostic sign of painful lumbar discs. However, this does not directly answer the question about predicting concordant pain provocation during provocative disc injection. Therefore, based on these documents, it seems that MRI may not accurately predict concordant pain provocation during provocative disc injection.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
