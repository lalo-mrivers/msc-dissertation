["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents provide information on the impact of surfactant therapy on chronic lung disease. The study 'Surfactant replacement therapy in premature babies with respiratory distress syndrome: factors affecting the response to surfactant and comparison of outcome from 1982-86 and 1987-91' reports that the overall respiratory improvement was better in the second period (Period 2, 1987-91) compared to the first period (Period 1, 1982-86). This suggests that the timing of surfactant treatment may play a role in rates of chronic lung disease. Additionally, the study 'Impact of lung surfactant therapy on chronic lung diseases in premature infants' mentions the emergence of a form of chronic lung disease now seen in surfactant-treated premature infants who had no acute lung disease. This implies that the timing of surfactant treatment may also affect mortality rates.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
