["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about whether uterine myomas really grow during pregnancy. We can look at the relevant documents to see if they provide any information on this topic. The first document talks about recurrence of myomas after myomectomy and doesn't mention anything about pregnancy or volume change of myomas during pregnancy. The second document discusses the indications for myomectomy, but again doesn't provide any information on the topic. The third document is a cytogenetic study of 139 uterine leiomyomas and doesn't mention pregnancy or uterine myoma growth either. The fourth document talks about pre-surgical treatment of uterine myomas with LH-RH agonists, but it's more focused on the effects of the treatment rather than any changes during pregnancy. Based on this information, we can conclude that none of the documents provide a clear answer to the question.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
