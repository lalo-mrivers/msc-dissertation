["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents suggest that different trauma scores have varying degrees of correlation with patient outcomes. In the study '[Do trauma score and injury severity score in evaluation of the trauma patients: a preliminary report of 1000 cases]' it is mentioned that Trauma Scores under 16 were associated with hospitalization being necessary for most patients, while all fatal cases had an Injury Severity Score greater than 24. Similarly, the document '[Judgement of prognosis in multiple trauma of patients with blunt abdominal injuries based on different useful trauma scores]' states that the Trauma index of Schreinlechner and Eber is more practicable for classification of polytrauma because it shows a good correlation of score, fatality and prognoses. This suggests that surrogates of injury severity do influence the occurrence of heterotopic ossification in fractures of the acetabulum.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n}"]
