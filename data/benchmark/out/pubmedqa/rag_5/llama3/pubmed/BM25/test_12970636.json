["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking whether early discharge with nurse home visits affects the adequacy of newborn metabolic screening. None of the provided documents directly address this specific topic. However, we can analyze the studies mentioned. The first study discusses early discharge and home care for low-risk mothers and infants, which does not specifically mention newborn metabolic screening. The second study focuses on geriatric follow-up by home visits after hospital discharge, but again, it does not relate to newborn metabolic screening. The third study explores HIV-risk infant care through pediatric nurse practitioner outreach, which also does not address newborn metabolic screening. Therefore, based on the provided documents, we cannot draw a direct conclusion about the effect of early discharge with nurse home visits on adequacy of newborn metabolic screening.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\""]
