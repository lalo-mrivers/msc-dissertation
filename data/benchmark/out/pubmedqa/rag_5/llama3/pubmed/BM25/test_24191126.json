["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents provide information on the diagnosis of ovarian endometrioma and epithelial ovarian cancer. The first document discusses the reliability of visual diagnosis of ovarian endometriosis and does not mention CA72-4. The second document presents a case study of a patient with ovarian endometriosis associated with virilization, but it does not discuss the use of CA72-4 as a biomarker. The third document describes the preparation and clinical use of a radioimmunoassay CA125 kit for the diagnosis of epithelial ovarian cancer, but it does not mention CA72-4. The fourth document discusses the diagnostic value of magnetic resonance imaging in gynaecology and does not provide information on the use of CA72-4 as a biomarker. Therefore, based on the provided documents, there is no evidence to suggest that CA72-4 is a useful biomarker in differential diagnosis between ovarian endometrioma and epithelial ovarian cancer.\",\n\"answer_choice\": B"]
