["{\n\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about perioperative care in an animal model for training in abdominal surgery. The topic of preoperative fasting is discussed in the context of human patients undergoing cancer surgery. Since the study is on animal models, we can infer that the discussion around postoperative atrial fibrillation and stoma patients are not directly applicable to this question. Perioperative teaching and counseling are also specific to human patients and not relevant here. The concept of preoperative care as a whole is discussed in the first document, but there is no mention of animal models or fasting specifically.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"B\"\n}"]
